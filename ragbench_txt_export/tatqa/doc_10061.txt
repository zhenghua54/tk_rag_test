During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we purchased a group annuity contract to transfer the pension benefit obligations and annuity administration for a select group of retirees or their beneficiaries to an annuity provider. As a result of the transfer of the pension liability to the annuity provider and other lump sum payments to participants of the Pension Plans, we recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $6.7 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2019.
