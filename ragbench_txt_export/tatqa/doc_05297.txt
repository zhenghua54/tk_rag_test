Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing decreased $2.7 million, or 13.2%, in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The change is due primarily to a decrease of $2.2 million in incentive commissions related to revision of our commission plan from total contract value to annual contract value coupled with lower sales in fiscal 2018.
