On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax assessment on previously tax-deferred foreign earnings and imposing new taxes on certain foreign-sourced income. We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of up to eight years.
