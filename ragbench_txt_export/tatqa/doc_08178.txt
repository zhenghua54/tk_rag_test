In connection with the acquisition of Connect First on January 14, 2019, a net deferred tax liability of $3.2 million was established, the most significant component of which is related to the book/tax basis differences associated with the acquired technology and customer relationships. The net deferred tax liability from this acquisition created an additional source of income to realize deferred tax assets. As the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, this additional source of income resulted in the release of the Companyâ€™s previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred assets. Consistent with the applicable guidance the release of the valuation allowance of $3.2 million caused by the acquisition was recorded in the consolidated financial statements outside of acquisition accounting as a tax benefit to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
