Trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist.
