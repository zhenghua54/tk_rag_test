On May 16, 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei and 68 of its non-U.S. affiliates on the “entity list” under Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which had the effect of prohibiting all future sales by the Company of any product to Huawei or its affiliates, absent obtaining a license from BIS. While BIS has broad authority to issue licenses, the rulemaking imposes a presumption that licenses will be denied.
