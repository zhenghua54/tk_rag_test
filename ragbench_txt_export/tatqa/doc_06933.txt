The reporting accountantsâ€™ work surrounding the potential equity raise not completed includes a working capital report that requires the accountant to have detailed knowledge of the Group. If a firm other than the audit firm were to undertake this work, they would require a significant amount of additional time to become familiar with the Group. Deloitte was therefore chosen to undertake this work as it was considered to be sensible and more efficient both in terms of time and costs.
