As of July 27, 2019, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $676 million, $1 billion, and $756 million, respectively. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. If not utilized, the federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. We have provided a valuation allowance of $111 million for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized.
