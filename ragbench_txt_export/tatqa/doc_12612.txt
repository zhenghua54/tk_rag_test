As a result, both vessels were derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets and sales-type lease receivables were recognized based on the remaining amounts owing to Teekay LNG, including the purchase obligations. Teekay LNG recognized a gain of $14.3 million upon derecognition of the vessels for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was included in write-down and loss on sale of vessels in the Company's consolidated statements of loss (see Note 19). Awilco purchased both vessels in January 2020 (see Note 24(a)).
