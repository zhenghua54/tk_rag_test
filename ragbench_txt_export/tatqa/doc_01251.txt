The Company’s estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: Level 1: inputs to the valuation are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets Level 2: inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 3: valuation is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the Company’s own estimates of assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing the asset
