During FY19 we have undertaken energy audits across all our UK manufacturing sites as part of our Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’) compliance programme, which is a mandatory energy assessment scheme for UK organisations. Our progress on energy efficiency improvements remains good, and we have delivered a further 4.9% improvement in our primary energy per tonne of product against last year, and 26.5% over the last six years.
