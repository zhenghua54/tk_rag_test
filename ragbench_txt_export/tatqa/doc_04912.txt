Relative TSR is used as a measure in our LTI plan to align executive outcomes and long‐term shareholder value creation. The peer group is the ASX30 excluding metals and mining companies. Peer group ranking at the 75th percentile or higher 100% vesting is achieved and ranking at the median 50% vesting is achieved. Between the 75th  and median, pro-rata vesting is achieved from 50% to 100%. Peer group ranking below the median results in zero vesting.
