As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $173.5 million and $137.2 million, respectively. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, investments and operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those planned and will depend on certain factors, such as our growth and our operating results.
