Our revenues and operating results are significantly affected by the timing, number and breadth of our theatrical releases and their budgets, the timing of television syndication agreements, and our amortization policy for the first 12 months of commercial exploitation for a film. The timing of releases is determined based on several factors. A significant portion of the films we distribute are delivered to Indian theaters at times when theater attendance has traditionally been highest, including school holidays, national holidays and the festivals. This timing of releases also takes into account competitor film release dates, major cricket events in India and film production schedules. Significant holidays and festivals, such as Diwali, Eid and Christmas, occur during July to December each year, and the Indian Premier League cricket season generally occurs during April and May of each year. The Tamil New Year, called Pongal, falls in January each year making the quarter ending March an important one for Tamil releases.
