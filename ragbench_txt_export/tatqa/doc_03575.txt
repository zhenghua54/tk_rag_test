In June 2019 and December 2017, as a result of the Groupâ€™s assessment of the realizability of its Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets, the Group recorded non-cash charges to tax expense of $54.7 million and $30.4 million, respectively, and $25.8 million to equity in December 2017 to reduce the carrying value of these assets. The assessment of the realizability of the Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets is based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets. The Group will continue to assess and record any necessary changes to align its deferred tax assets to their realizable value.
