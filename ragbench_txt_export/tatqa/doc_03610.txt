Our net-centric customers tend to purchase their service on a price per megabit basis. Our corporate customers tend to utilize a small portion of their allocated bandwidth on their connections and tend to purchase their service on a per connection basis. Revenues from our corporate and net-centric customers represented 64.9% and 35.1% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2018 and represented 62.3% and 37.7% of total service revenue, respectively, for 2017. Revenues from corporate customers increased 11.8% to $337.8 million for 2018 from $302.1 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our number of our corporate customers. Revenues from our net-centric customers decreased by 0.4% to $182.3 million for 2018 from $183.1 million for 2017 primarily due to an increase in our number of net-centric customers being offset by a decline in our average price per megabit. Our revenue from our net- centric customers has declined as a percentage of our total revenue and grew at a slower rate than our corporate customer revenue because net-centric customers purchase our services based upon a price per megabit basis and our average price per megabit declined by 25.9% from 2017 to 2018. Additionally, the net-centric market experiences a greater level of pricing pressure than the corporate market and net-centric customers who renew their service with us expect their renewed service to be at a lower price than their current price. We expect that our average price per megabit will continue to decline at similar rates which would result in our corporate revenues continuing to represent a greater portion of our total revenues and our net-centric revenues continuing to grow at a lower rate than our corporate revenues. Additionally, the impact of foreign exchange rates has a more significant impact on our net- centric revenues.
