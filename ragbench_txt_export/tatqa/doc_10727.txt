Of this £41.5m non-cash charge, approximately two-thirds relates to the
RHM pension scheme and the balance relates to the Premier Foods pension schemes. Restructuring costs were £16.8m in the year; an £8.3m increase on the prior year and included circa £14m associated with the consolidation of the Group’s logistics operations to one central location in the year due to higher than anticipated implementation costs.
