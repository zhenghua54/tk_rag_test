Cogeco provides executive, administrative, financial and strategic planning services and additional services to the Corporation under a Management Services Agreement (the "Agreement"). On May 1, 2019, the Corporation and Cogeco agreed to amend the Agreement in order to replace the methodology used to establish the management fees payable by the Corporation to Cogeco, which was based on a percentage of the consolidated revenue of the Corporation, with a new methodology based on the costs incurred by Cogeco plus a reasonable mark-up. This cost-plus methodology was adopted to avoid future variations of the management fee percentage due to the frequent changes of the Corporation's consolidated revenue pursuant to business acquisitions and divestitures. Prior to this change, management fees represented 0.75% of the consolidated revenue from continuing and discontinued operations of the Corporation (0.85% for the period prior to the MetroCast acquisition on January 4, 2018). Provision is made for future adjustment upon the request of either Cogeco or the Corporation from time to time during the term of the Agreement. For fiscal 2019 management fees paid to Cogeco amounted to $19.9 million, compared to $19.0 million for fiscal 2018.
