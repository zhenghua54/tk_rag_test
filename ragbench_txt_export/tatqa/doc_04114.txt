(1) On May 18, 2017, The Organization and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (“O&C Committee”) approved a change in the vesting policy regarding the existing 2017 Three-year PSU Awards and 2016 Three-year PSU Awards for Ilham Kadri. The approved change resulted in a pro-rata share of vesting calculated on the close date of the sale of Diversey. Dr. Kadri’s awards were still subject to the performance metrics stipulated in the plan documents, and will be paid out in accordance with the original planned timing.
