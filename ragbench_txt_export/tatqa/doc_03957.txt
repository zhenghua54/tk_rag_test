Revenues and related costs on construction contracts are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied over time in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, revenue and associated profit, will be recognized as the customer obtains control of the goods and services promised in the contract (i.e., performance obligations). The cost of uninstalled materials or equipment will generally be excluded from the Companyâ€™s recognition of profit, unless specifically produced or manufactured for a project, because such costs are not considered to be a measure of progress.
