Active Merchants. We define active merchants as home improvement merchants and healthcare providers that have submitted at least one consumer application during the twelve months ended at the date of measurement. Because our transaction volume is a function of the size, engagement and growth of our merchant network, active merchants, in aggregate, are an indicator of future revenue and profitability, although they are not directly correlated. The comparative measures can also be impacted by disciplined corrective action taken by the Company to remove merchants from our program who do not meet our customer satisfaction standards.
