A contract asset will be recorded if we have recognized revenue but do not have an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. For example, this will be the case if implementation services offered in a cloud arrangement are identified as a separate performance obligation and are provided to a customer prior to us being able to bill the customer. In addition, a contract asset may arise in relation to subscription licenses if the license revenue that is recognized upfront exceeds the amount that we are able to invoice the customer at that time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional.
