Our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $20 million and $28 million as of January 3, 2020 and December 28, 2018, respectively. The valuation allowance decreased by $8 million primarily due to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business and releases related to the expected utilization of certain carryover attributes, partially offset by an increase related to foreign withholding taxes.
