(1) During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we identified an amount which should have been recorded in the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 to reduce income tax expense by $35 million. Our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, as presented above, has been revised to reflect the correction. See further discussion in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
