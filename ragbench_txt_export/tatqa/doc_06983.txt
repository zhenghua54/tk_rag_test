As a result of a loss in a foreign location, we have a net operating loss carry-forward (“NOL”) of approximately $0.3 million
available to offset future income. All $0.3 million of the NOL expires in 2025. We have established a valuation allowance for this
NOL because the ability to utilize it is not more likely than not.
