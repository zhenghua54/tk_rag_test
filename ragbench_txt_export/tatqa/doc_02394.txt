As of April 26, 2019, we have federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2 million and $3 million, respectively. In addition, we have gross state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $25 million and $138 million, respectively. The majority of the state credit carryforwards are California research credits which are offset by a valuation allowance as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized. We also have $4 million of foreign net operating losses, and $43 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards generated by our Dutch subsidiary which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. Certain acquired net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2038. The California research credit and Dutch foreign tax credit carryforwards do not expire.
