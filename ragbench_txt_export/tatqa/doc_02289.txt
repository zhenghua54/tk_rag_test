The Audit Committee maintains written procedures that require it to annually review and pre-approve the scope
of all services to be performed by our independent auditor. This review includes an evaluation of whether the
provision of non-audit services by our independent auditor is compatible with maintaining the auditor’s independence in providing audit and audit-related services. The Committee’s procedures prohibit the independent auditor from providing any non-audit services unless the service is permitted under applicable law and is pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its Chairman. The Chairman is authorized to pre-approve projects if the total anticipated cost of all projects pre-approved by him during any fiscal quarter does not exceed $250,000. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Company’s independent auditor to provide up to $75,000 per quarter of miscellaneous permitted tax services that do not constitute discrete and separate projects. The Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer are required periodically to advise the full Committee of the scope and cost of services not pre-approved by the full Committee. Although applicable regulations permit us to waive these pre-approval requirements in certain limited circumstances, the Audit Committee did not use these waiver provisions in either 2018 or 2019.
