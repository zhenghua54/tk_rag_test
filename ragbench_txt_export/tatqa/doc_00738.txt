Cash flows from operations provided a source of funds of $1,066 million, $1,058 million and $1,310 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase was driven primarily by lower employee annual incentive payments, lower retailer investments and lower restructuring payments, partially offset by working capital timing and higher interest and tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2019.
