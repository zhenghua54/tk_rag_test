The foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to the Company's operations in Thailand, Malta and Ireland. The Company's Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to the Company based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. The Company's tax holiday periods in Thailand expire between fiscal 2022 and 2026, however, the Company actively seeks to obtain new tax holidays. The Company does not expect the future expiration of any of its tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on its effective tax rate. The Company’s Microsemi operations in Malaysia are subject to a tax holiday that effectively reduces the income tax rate in that jurisdiction. Microsemi’s tax holiday in Malaysia was granted in 2009 and is effective through December 2019, subject to continued compliance with the tax holiday’s requirements. The aggregate dollar expense derived from these tax holidays approximated $0.1 million in fiscal 2019. The aggregate dollar benefit derived from these tax holidays approximated $6.2 million and $13.2 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2019 did not impact basic and diluted net income per common share. The impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2018 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.03 and $0.02, respectively. The impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2017 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.06.
