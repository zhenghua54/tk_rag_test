On October 1 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with a consultant for toxicology studies. The consultant quoted a commitment of approximately $988,000 as an
estimate for the study. 50% of the total price is to be paid upon the signing of the agreement, 35% of the total price is to be upon completion of the in-life study, and the
remaining 15% of the total price is to be paid upon the issuance of the report. If the Company cancels the study the Company will be required to pay a cancelation fee. If the
cancelation happens prior to the arrival of the test animals then the Company will need to pay between 20% and 50% of the animal fees depending on when the cancellation
happens. If the cancellation occurs after the animals arrive but before the study begins then the company will be responsible for paying 50% of the protocol price plus a fee of
$7,000 per room/week for animal husbandry until the animals can be relocated or disposed of. If the Company cancels the study after it has begun then the Company will need to pay any fees for procured items for the study and any nonrecoverable expenses incurred by the vendor. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has paid $0 and there is a balance of $493,905 due.
