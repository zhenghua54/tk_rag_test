Cloud services and subscriptions revenues are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user doesnâ€™t take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced business-to-business (B2B) integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as "platform as a service" (PaaS), "software as a service" (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.
