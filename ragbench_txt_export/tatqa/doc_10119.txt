We adopted ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018. Consistent with the modified retrospective transaction method, our results of operations for periods prior to the adoption of ASC 606 remain unchanged. As a result, the change in total revenues from 2018 to 2019 included a component of accounting policy change arising from the adoption of ASC 606.
