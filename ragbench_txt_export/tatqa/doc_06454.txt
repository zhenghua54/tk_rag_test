Changes in presentation —As discussed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we adopted ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of 2019 using the retrospective method, which changed the financial statement presentation of service costs and the other components of net periodic benefit cost. The service cost component continues to be included in operating income; however, the other components are now presented in a separate line below earnings from operations captioned “Other pension and post-retirement expenses, net” in our consolidated statements of earnings. Further, in connection with the adoption, plan administrative expenses historically presented as a component of service cost are now presented as a component of expected return on plan assets. The prior year components of net periodic benefit costs and assumptions on the long-term rate of return on assets have been recast to conform to current year presentation.
