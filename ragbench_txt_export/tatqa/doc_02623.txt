In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive. Options over 36m shares (2017/18: 23m shares, 2016/17: 27m shares) were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is antidilutive.
