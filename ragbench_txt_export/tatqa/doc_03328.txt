Contract revenues were $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $67.2 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of 4.8%. This decrease was driven by a 4% decrease in our Mission Systems revenue due to reduction of revenue on cost-based contracts and a 4% reduction in ISR revenues due to ceiling limitations in a large customer's funding.
