The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by incremental revenue from the acquisitions of the EIS Business in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Practice Fusion in the first quarter of 2018. Total revenue includes the amortization of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which totaled $24 million and $29 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The growth in both recurring and non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year was also largely driven by incremental revenue from the previously mentioned acquisitions.
