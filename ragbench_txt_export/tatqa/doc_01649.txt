The decrease in consolidated net revenues for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues of $1.1 billion due to: • lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018); • lower revenues recognized from Hearthstone; • lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty franchise catalog titles; and • lower revenues recognized from Overwatch.
