We require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. OurRevolving Facility will expire in September 2021, and we expect to renew this line of credit or find an alternative lender prior to the expiration date. Further, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit, and may require our immediate repayment of the outstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market acceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, new product development efforts, capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer term liquidity requirements, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.
