Cost of revenue increased $1.5 million, or 1%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to $6.0 million in increased capitalized software amortization and $4.5 million in increased content costs. These increased costs were partially offset by $6.6 million in decreased amortization of acquired intangible assets and $2.9 million in external implementation service costs. These costs were incurred to service our existing customers and support our continued growth. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a higher mix of subscription revenue, which carries a higher gross margin.
