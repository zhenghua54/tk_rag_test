Net cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2018, was $83.2 million, compared to $99.0 million in fiscal year 2017, a decrease of $15.8 million, or 15.9%, primarily due to decrease in working capital movement of $24.3 million mainly attributable to increase in trade receivables to $19.1 million and decrease in trade payables by $5.4 million. The cash flow from operating activities has also decreased due to increase in interest and income tax paid in fiscal 2018 by 2.4 million and $2.9 million respectively. The aforesaid decrease is partially offset on account of deconsolidation of a subsidiary during the year.
