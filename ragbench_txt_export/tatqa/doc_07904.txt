While we saw improvements in some areas of our business, our overall performance and stock price was negatively impacted by several significant factors: • Revenue and business momentum in our former Enterprise Security segment declined in FY19. • The Company was subject to an internal investigation, which was commenced and completed by the Audit Committee of the Board (the ‘‘Audit Committee’’) in connection with concerns raised by a former employee. • We announced a restructuring plan pursuant to which we targeted reductions of our global workforce of up to approximately 8%. • Our executive leadership team was in transition with announced executive officer departures in November 2018 and January 2019.
