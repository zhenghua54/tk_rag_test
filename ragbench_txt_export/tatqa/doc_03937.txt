Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 30â€“90 day payment terms depending on the geographical territory in which sales are generated. The carrying value of trade and other receivables also represents their fair value. During the year-ended 31 March 2019 a provision for impairment of $0.6M (2018: $0.6M) was recognised in operating expenses against receivables.
