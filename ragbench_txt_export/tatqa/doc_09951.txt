As of December 31, 2019, we had $19.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $14.8 million was held outside the U.S. in certain of our foreign operations. If these assets are distributed to the U.S., we may be subject to additional U.S. taxes in certain circumstances. We have not provided for any repatriation taxes and currently have the intent to leave such cash and cash equivalents in the foreign countries. Cash and cash equivalents increased from $18.0 million as of December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities, offset partially by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and our equity investment in WeekenGO. We expect that cash on hand will be sufficient to provide for working capital needs for at least the next twelve months.
