Cash provided by operating activities increased by $151.8 million to $116.7 million in 2018 compared to cash utilized of $35.1 million in 2017. The increase in cash utilized in 2018 was primarily due to: • higher contributions recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool as a result of improved utilization and daily hire rates from the Cool Pool vessels; • lower charterhire payments as a result of the expiry of the charter-back arrangement of the Golar Grand from Golar Partners in November 2017; • $50.7 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra; and • the improvement on the general timing of working capital in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
