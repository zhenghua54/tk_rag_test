The Group applies the practical expedient in the revenue standard and does not disclose information about the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on contracts that are unsatisfied, as the Group has the right to consideration from its customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Groupâ€™s services to date. This is applied to all its data centre services revenue, on the basis that the upfront project fees are not a significant portion of each contract.
