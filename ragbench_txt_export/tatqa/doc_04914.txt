ROFE is an important measures to drive behaviours consistent with the delivery of long‐term shareholder value. ROFE improvements can be delivered through earnings growth as well as the disciplined allocation of capital and management of assets, which is important for a business that is building capabilities for the future. Lease‐adjusted ROFE measures the balance between our earnings growth and the disciplined allocation and application of assets used to generate those earnings. We adjust for leases to recognise that a very significant portion of our sites are leased. This approach is also similar to the accounting standard definition of ROFE that will change to incorporate a lease-adjusted definition from F20.
