During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, VMware entered into an arrangement with Dell to transfer approximately 250 professional services employees from Dell to VMware. These employees are experienced in providing professional services delivering VMware technology and this transfer centralizes these resources within the Company in order to serve its customers more efficiently and effectively. The transfer was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. VMware also expects that Dell will resell VMware consulting solutions.
