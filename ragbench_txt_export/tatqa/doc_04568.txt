Net revenue: Net revenue from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.1 million to $713.3 million from $716.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues from our structural steel fabrication and erection business, which had increased activity in the comparable period on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was largely offset by DBMGâ€™s acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018, and from higher revenues from our construction modeling and detailing business as a result of an increase in project work.
