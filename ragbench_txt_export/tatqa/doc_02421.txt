BCE net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $672 million in Q4 2019, or $0.74 per share, were higher than the $606 million, or $0.68 per share, reported in Q4 2018. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA, lower other expense and lower severance, acquisition and other costs. This was partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and finance costs. The adoption of IFRS 16 did not have a significant impact on net earnings. Adjusted net earnings remained stable at $794 million in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, and adjusted EPS decreased to $0.88, from $0.89 in Q4 2018.
