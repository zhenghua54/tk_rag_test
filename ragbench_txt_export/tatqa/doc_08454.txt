Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $94.2 million to $684.9 million from $779.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was directly correlated to the fluctuations in wholesale voice termination volumes, in addition to a slight reduction in margin mix attributed to market pressures on call termination rates.
