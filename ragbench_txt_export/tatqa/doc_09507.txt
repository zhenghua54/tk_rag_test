The Groupâ€™s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at floating rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR. The Group is aware that LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021 and is actively monitoring the output from the various working groups on LIBOR reform. The Group will also be carrying out a review on whether the fall-back provision across its existing facilities (including bank debt, floating rate notes and interest rate swaps) is adequate, and look to implement changes as and when it is appropriate. Bond debt and other capital market debt is generally issued at fixed rates.
