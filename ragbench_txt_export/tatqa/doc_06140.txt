Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $52.8 million decrease was a result of a decrease in net borrowings by the Construction and Broadcasting segments, and offset in part by the increase in net borrowings by the Energy segment and Corporate segment, and a decline in cash paid to noncontrolling interest holders driven by the proceeds from our Life Sciences segment's sale of BeneVir in 2018.
