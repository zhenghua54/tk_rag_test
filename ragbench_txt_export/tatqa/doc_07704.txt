The recoverable amounts determined in a prior year for the Bell Wireless and Bell Wireline groups of CGUs exceed their corresponding current carrying values by a substantial margin and have been carried forward and used in the impairment test for the current year. We believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which the estimate of recoverable amounts of the Bell Wireless or Bell Wireline groups of CGUs is based would not cause their carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
