The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for fiscal years ended on or after 2016 and for state tax purposes on or after fiscal year 2013. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust net operating losses or tax credits that were generated prior to these fiscal years. In the major foreign jurisdictions, fiscal 2012 and subsequent periods remain open and subject to examination by taxing authorities.
