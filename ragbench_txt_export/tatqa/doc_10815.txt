During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company received an unsolicited offer to purchase its Houston, TX, facility. At June 30, 2019, the facility included assets with a carrying value of approximately $5,055. Although management has not committed to the sale, a sale of the facility during fiscal 2020 is likely and the Company expects to record a gain on the sale upon closing, since the offer represents full appraisal value for the facility. Therefore, the assets are considered held for sale at June 30, 2019. Also held for sale at June 30, 2019, was the Company’s Elizabethtown, KY facility. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell the property for $1,300 pending an expected closing date during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. An impairment loss was recorded on this facility during fiscal 2017 as disclosed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Total assets held for sale by the Company at June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $6,355 and $1,300, respectively, and were included in assets held for sale on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet for each year. Those balances are not included on the above table.
