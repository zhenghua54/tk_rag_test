As of December 31, 2019, we had no restricted investments in a loss position for a period of time greater than 12 months. As of December 31, 2018, we identified six restricted investments totaling $87.4 million that had been in a loss position for a period of time greater than 12 months with unrealized losses of $6.4 million. The unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates relative to rates at the time of purchase. Based on the underlying credit quality of the investments, we generally hold such securities until we recover our cost basis. Therefore, we did not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
