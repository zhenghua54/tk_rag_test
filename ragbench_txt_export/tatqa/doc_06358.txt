For the first step of our fiscal 2019 annual impairment test, we estimated the fair value of CTS based upon market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies and for CGD and CMS, we estimated the fair value based upon a combination of market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies and discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flows were based on discrete three-year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios, influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of the three-year forecasts. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 15% for CGD and 12.5% for CMS. The results of our 2019 annual impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value for our CTS and CGD reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by over 100%, while the estimated fair value of our CMS reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by over 60%.
