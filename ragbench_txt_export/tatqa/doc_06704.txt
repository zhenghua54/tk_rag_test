We recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the employee benefit plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent changes in the funded status are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in unrecognized pension items, a component of AOCL, which are included in total stockholdersâ€™ deficit. The amount of unamortized pension items is recorded net of tax.
