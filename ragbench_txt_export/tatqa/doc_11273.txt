(1) Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on ending accounts receivable and net revenue for each period. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the fourth quarters presented above). The year over year increases in DSO in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were primarily due to less favorable shipping linearity and, in the case of fiscal 2019, one of our major distributors choosing not to take advantage of an early payment discount.
