Net revenue: Net revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $97.5 million to $696.1 million from $793.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease can be attributed to changes in our customer mix, fluctuations in wholesale voice termination volumes and market pressures, which resulted in a decline in revenue contribution.
