TELEPHONY Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter telephony service customers net additions amounted to 2,778 compared to net losses 16,900 for the same period of the prior year mainly due to: • more telephony bundles due to additional promotional activity in the second half of fiscal 2019; and • growth in the business sector; partly offset by • increasing wireless penetration in North America and various unlimited offers launched by wireless operators causing some customers to cancel their landline telephony services for wireless telephony services only.
