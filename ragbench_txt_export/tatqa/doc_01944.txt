(2) At March 31, 2019, we had a $1.1 million liability reserve for unrecognized income tax positions which is not reflected in the table above. The timing of potential cash outflows related to the unrecognized tax positions is not reasonably determinable and therefore, is not scheduled. Substantially all of this reserve is included in Other non-current liabilities. Additional information regarding unrecognized tax positions is provided in Note 10, Income Taxes.
