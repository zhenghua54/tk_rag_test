The UK exceptional current tax expense in the year of £6.4 million represents in full the corporation tax arising in the current year in respect of the prior year underpayment of the minimum PID. This one-off tax expense in respect of prior year profits has been classified as exceptional (see accounting policy in note 2) based on its incidence, and so is excluded from the Group’s measure of underlying earnings.
