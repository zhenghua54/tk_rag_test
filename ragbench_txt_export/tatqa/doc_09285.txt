In the emerging markets, the regional associates continued to invest in network, spectrum and content to drive data usage. Pre-tax contributions from the associates declined a steep 38% mainly due to Airtel and Telkomsel, the Group’s two largest regional associates. Airtel recorded operating losses on sustained pricing pressures in the Indian mobile market. Telkomsel’s earnings fell on lower revenue due to fierce competition in Indonesia in the earlier part of the financial year when the mandatory SIM card registration exercise took effect. Including associates’ contributions, the Group’s EBIT was S$4.01 billion, down 24% from last year.
