We also provide post-retirement life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Domestic employees who were hired prior to 1982 and certain former union employees are eligible for life insurance benefits upon retirement. We fund life insurance benefits through term life insurance policies and intend to continue funding all of the premiums on a pay-as-you-go basis.
