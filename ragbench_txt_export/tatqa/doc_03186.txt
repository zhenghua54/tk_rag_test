General and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017 were negatively impacted by approximately $0.3 million primarily as a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and South African rand. Personnel-related costs increased primarily as a result of salaries and benefits associated with increased headcount.
