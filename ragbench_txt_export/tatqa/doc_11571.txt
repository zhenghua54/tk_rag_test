We adopted the updated guidance on stock based compensation and we have tax deductions on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock awards that exceed stock compensation expense amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes. The gross excess tax deductions were $2.9 million, $2.6 and $0 in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recognized in the income statement as they occur.
