Operating Income: CTS operating income increased 28% in 2019 to $77.2 million compared to $60.4 million in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018.
