Sales and marketing expenses increased $80 million, or 38%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The overall increase was primarily due to increased employee compensation-related costs, including amortization of capitalized commissions, of $55 million, driven by headcount growth, and an increase in marketing program costs of $10 million. The increase in marketing program costs was driven by increased volume of advertising activities. Further contributing to the overall increase was an increase in allocated shared costs of $11 million.
