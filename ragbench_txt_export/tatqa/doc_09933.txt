As part of our July 2017 private placement transaction with Mr. Schutte, we issued warrants to purchase 1,782,531 shares of our common stock. The warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $0.528 per share and expire five years after issuance (See Note 8). We have assigned a relative fair value of $495 thousand to the warrants out of the total $4.0 million proceeds from the private placement transaction and have accounted for these warrants as equity.
