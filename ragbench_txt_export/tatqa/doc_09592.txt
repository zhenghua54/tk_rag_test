Order development was mixed in the Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East region. The majority of industrial businesses posted order growth, led by double-digit growth in Mobility, which won several large contracts in the year under review. This increase was more than offset by a substantial decline in SGRE due mainly to a lower volume from large orders and a decrease in Digital Industries. In contrast to the region overall, orders were up clearly in Germany, driven by sharp growth in Gas and Power which recorded, among others, a large high voltage direct current (HVDC) order. Mobility recorded a significant increase in order intake in Germany, while the other industrial businesses posted declines.
