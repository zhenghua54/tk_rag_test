In July 2019, the Company formally established its EMEA headquarters in Ireland and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. As a result of these actions, the Company transferred regional relationship and territory rights from its Canadian entity to enable each regional headquarters to develop and maintain merchant and commercial operations within its respective region, while keeping the ownership of all of the Company's current developed technology within Canada. These transfers reflect the growing proportion of the Company's business occurring internationally and resulted in a one-time capital gain. As a result of the capital gain, ongoing operations, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the utilization of all applicable credits and other tax attributes, including loss carryforwards, the Company has a provision for income taxes of $29,027 in the year ended December 31, 2019.
