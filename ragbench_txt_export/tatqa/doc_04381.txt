The significant changes in the financial statements noted in the table above are primarily due to the transition from sellthrough revenue recognition to sell-in revenue recognition as required by the New Revenue Standard, which eliminated the balance of deferred income on shipments to distributors, significantly reduced accounts receivable, and significantly increased retained earnings. Prior to the acquisition of Microsemi, Microsemi already recognized revenue on a sell-in basis, so the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard was primarily driven by Microchip's historical business excluding Microsemi.
