Cost of merchant solutions increased $208.4 million, or 55.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in GMV facilitated through Shopify Payments, which resulted in higher payment processing and interchange fees. The increase was also due to higher amortization, largely related to the technology resulting from the 6RS acquisition, higher product costs associated with expanding our product offerings and higher credit card fees for processing merchant billings. Cost of merchant solutions as a percentage of revenues increased from 35.0% in 2018 to 37.0% in 2019, mainly as a result of Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue.
