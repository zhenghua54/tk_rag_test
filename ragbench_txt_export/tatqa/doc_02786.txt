In determining revenue, gross profit and income from operations for our segments, we do not include in revenue the amortization of acquisition related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenues acquired in a business acquisition. We also exclude the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, expenses not reflective of our core business and transaction-related costs and non-cash asset impairment charges from the operating segment data provided to our Chief Operating Decision Maker.
