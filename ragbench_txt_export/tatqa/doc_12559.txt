Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) valuation method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period.
