The provisions for obligations similar to pensions essentially comprise commitments from employment anniversary allowances, death benefits and partial retirement plans. Provisions amounting to €34 million (30/9/2018: €41 million) were allocated for these commitments. The commitments are valued on the basis of actuarial expert opinions. The valuation parameters used for this purpose are generally determined in the same way as for the company pension plan.
