For the year ended December 31, 2019, 70.0% of the Group’s revenue was earned from Shell (December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 74.2% and 92.6%, respectively) and accounts receivable were not collateralized; however, management believes that the credit risk is partially offset by the creditworthiness of the Group’s counterparties. BG Group was acquired by Shell on February 15, 2016. This acquisition does not impact the contractual obligations under the existing charter party agreements. The Group did not experience significant credit losses on its accounts receivable portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2019. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. Management monitors exposure to credit risk, and they believe that there is no substantial credit risk arising from the Group’s counterparties.
