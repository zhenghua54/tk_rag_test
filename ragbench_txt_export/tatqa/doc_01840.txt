At December 31, 2019, we had five stock-based compensation plans: the Non-Employee Directors' Stock Retirement Plan
("Directors' Plan"), the 2004 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan"), the 2009 Omnibus Equity and Performance
Incentive Plan ("2009 Plan"), the 2014 Performance & Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan"), and the 2018 Equity and Incentive
Compensation Plan ("2018 Plan"). Future grants can only be made under the 2018 Plan.
