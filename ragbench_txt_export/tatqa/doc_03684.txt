Annualized Fourth Quarter Inventory Turns We calculate annualized fourth quarter inventory turns as cost of sales during the fourth quarter annualized and divided by net inventories at the end of the fourth quarter. This indicates how well we are managing our inventory levels, with higher inventory turns resulting in more working capital availability and a higher return on our investments in inventory. Our annualized fourth quarter inventory turns for fiscal 2019 decreased to 2.1 turns from 2.2 turns in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of a decrease in demand for sales of our large ELA tools, partially offset by the impact of lower inventories due to restructuring charges.
