Network Operations Expenses. Network operations expenses include the costs of personnel associated with service delivery, network management, and customer support, network facilities costs, fiber and equipment maintenance fees, leased circuit costs, access and facilities fees paid to building owners and excise taxes billed to our customers and recorded on a gross basis. Non-cash equity-based compensation expense is included in network operations expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation. Our network operations expenses, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, increased 0.1% from 2018 to 2019 as we were connected to 8.0% more customer connections and we were connected to 125 more on-net buildings as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in network operations expense is primarily attributable to an increase in costs related to our network and facilities expansion activities, the increase in our off-net revenues and the increase in taxes recorded on a gross basis partly offset by price reductions obtained in certain of our circuit costs and fewer fiber operating leases. When we provide off-net services we also assume the cost of the associated tail circuits.
