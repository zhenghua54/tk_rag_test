We have the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion of the Notes. It is our intent to settle the principal amount of the convertible senior notes with cash, and therefore, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion option on diluted net income (loss) per share. From the time of the issuance of the Notes, the average market price of our common stock has been less than the initial conversion price of the Notes, and consequently no shares have been included in diluted earnings per share for the conversion value of the Notes.
