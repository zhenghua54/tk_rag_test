The 4% decrease in revenue this year was a result of: • the sale of our publishing business in the second quarter of 2019; and • lower revenue at the Toronto Blue Jays, primarily as a result of a distribution from Major League Baseball in 2018; partially offset by • higher revenue generated by Sportsnet and TSC. Excluding the sale of our publishing business and the impact of the distribution from Major League Baseball last year, Media revenue would have increased by 1% this year.
