Under the 2015 Plan, the share option price may not be less than the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant and the term of each share option may not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. Share options typically vest over 4 years, but vesting provisions can vary based on the discretion of the board of directors.
