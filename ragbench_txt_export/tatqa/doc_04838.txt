Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Leidos common stockholders by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based compensation awards is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method, only in periods in which such effect would have been dilutive for the period.
