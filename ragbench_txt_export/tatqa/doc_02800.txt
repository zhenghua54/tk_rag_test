Under U.S. GAAP, companies may make reasonable aggregations and approximations of returns data to accurately estimate returns. Our AirBar and sensor module returns and warranty experience to date has enabled us to make reasonable returns estimates, which are supported by the fact that our product sales involve homogenous transactions. The reserve for future sales returns is recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue and was insignificant as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
