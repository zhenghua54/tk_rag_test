In 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock in June 2019. These inflows were partially offset by scheduled repayments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.
