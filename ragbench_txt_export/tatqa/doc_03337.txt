For the year ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate was 18.9%, which was mainly due to deferred tax adjustments related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state taxes, offset by changes in the valuation allowance and excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of non-qualified stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our effective income tax rate was (141.7)% due to recording a full valuation allowance on the entire deferred tax assets.
