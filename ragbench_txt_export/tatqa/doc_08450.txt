As of May 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 33% and 26%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 67% and 74%, respectively, mature within one to four years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.
