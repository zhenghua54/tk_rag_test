Product revenues were $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 15.8% from $78.8 million recorded in 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by lower revenues from our tier 1 customers and by a decrease in our international business. Our hardware sales in the Restaurant/Retail reporting segment were down versus prior year as we completed hardware project installations with a large domestic customer during the first half of 2018 which was not recurring in 2019. Additionally, international sales were down in 2019 and SureCheck was divested. SureCheck product revenue was $0.7 million in 2019 versus $2.0 million in 2018.
