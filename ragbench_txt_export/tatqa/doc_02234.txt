With regards to ii), the TCE rate increased by $8,560, or 65.4%. The indicative rates presented by Clarksons Shipping increased by 91.7% for the twelve months of 2019 compared to the same twelve months in 2018 to $31,560 from $16,466, respectively. The rates presented by Clarksons Shipping were significantly influenced by the spike in the Suezmax tanker rates in the fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018. Our average TCE was also positively impacted by the increased tanker rates towards the end of 2019, but not to the same extent as the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping. We expect this spike to materialize to a larger extent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the rates reported by Clarksons Shipping.
