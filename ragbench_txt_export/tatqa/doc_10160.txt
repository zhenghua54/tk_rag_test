On January 31, 2019, we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the “January 2019 ASR”) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $760 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.3 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on January 30, 2019. The total number of shares received under the January 2019 ASR was based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the agreements occurred during May 2019, resulted in the receipt of approximately 0.8 million additional shares, which yielded a weighted-average share price of approximately $182.32 for the transaction period.
