Bell Wireless adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, mainly driven by the flow-through of higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses of 1.4% year over year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher product cost of goods sold from greater mix of premium handsets and increased handset costs, higher network operating costs to support the growth in our subscriber base and data consumption and higher bad debt expense driven by the growth in revenues. This was offset in part by the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margin, based on wireless operating revenues, of 37.9% increased by 1.4 pts over Q4 2018, mainly due to the impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, greater service revenue flow-through and promotional spending discipline during the holiday season, moderated by higher low-margin product sales in our total revenue base.
