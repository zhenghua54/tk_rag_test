The fair value of assets held for sale is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data. For the years ended 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2018, the Group has valued assets classified as held for sale at the contractually agreed sales price less estimated cost of sale or other observable evidence of market value.
