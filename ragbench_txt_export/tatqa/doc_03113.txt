During fiscal 2019, net sales decreased by $471.9 million, or 25%, compared to fiscal 2018, with decreases in the microelectronics and materials processing markets, partially offset by increases in the OEM components and instrumentation market. Ondax, which we acquired on October 5, 2018, contributed $6.4 million in incremental net sales to the materials processing market in the ILS segment in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we continued to experience weaker demand in the microelectronics and materials processing markets. Entering fiscal 2020, we have started seeing indications which could lead to increased future demand in the microelectronics flat panel display market, but this is balanced by possible continuing headwinds in the global materials processing industry.
