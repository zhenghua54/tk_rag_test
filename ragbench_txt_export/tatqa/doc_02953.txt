In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than
inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, our fiscal 2019. The modified retrospective transition method should be applied. We adopted this guidance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
