This was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to lower LIBOR rates, resulting in:
• $12.4 million decrease in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs;
• $8.7 million capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investments;
• $6.5 million decrease in interest expense incurred on the deposits received from Golar Partners following application of the deposit to the Hilli acquisition price and the conversion of the Hilli shareholder loans to equity following the Hilli Disposal in July 2018; and
• $1.0 million decrease in interest expense on the Hilli letter of credit, due to a contractual step down in the Hilli letter of credit from $300 million to $250 million in May 2019, and a further step down to $125 million in November 2019.
