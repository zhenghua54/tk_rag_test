We also recorded $22.9 million of non-cash asset impairment charges related to our acquisition of the patient/provider engagement solutions business from NantHealth in 2017, which included the write-downs of $2.2 million of acquired technology and $20.7 million, representing the unamortized value assigned to the modification of our existing commercial agreement with NantHealth, as we no longer expect to recover the value assigned to these assets.
