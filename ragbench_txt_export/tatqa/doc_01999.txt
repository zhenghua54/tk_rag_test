The following summarizes certain quarterly statement of operations data for each of the quarters in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data). The operating results in any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. We derived this data from the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements that, in our opinion, have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods presented. These unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.
