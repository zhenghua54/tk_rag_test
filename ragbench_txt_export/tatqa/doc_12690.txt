During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Canadian broadband services segment implemented a new customer management system, replacing 22 legacy systems. While the customer management system was still in the stabilization phase, contact center congestion resulted in lower services activations during most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Contact center and marketing operations had returned to normal at the end of the first quarter of 2019.
