Tax payments of $5.6 million made in 2019 were consistent with the prior year (2018 $5.7 million). Net capital expenditure of $11.9 million was also broadly consistent with the prior year (2018 $10.6 million), with the incremental spend of $1.3 million primarily related to investment in 5G. We continue to exercise careful management of capital investment to ensure efficient use of capital and maximise return on investment.
