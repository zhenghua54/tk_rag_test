The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The credit agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants (i) a minimum working capital ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and (ii) an annual limit on capital expenditures of $100.0 million. Additionally, the credit agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr., his spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100% of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50% of the Company’s voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the credit agreement. Further, dividends are restricted to the Company’s current dividend policy of one-third of the Company’s net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is allowed to repurchase up to $75.0 million of its capital stock in any year provided there is no default under the credit agreement and the Company has availability of at least $20.0 million under the facility.
