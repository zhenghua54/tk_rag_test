In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, our fiscal 2019. The retrospective transition method should be applied. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
