The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date.
