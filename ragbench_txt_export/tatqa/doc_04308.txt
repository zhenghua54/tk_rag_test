Year 2018 compared with year 2017
The $27.5 million increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was principally due to an $11.6 million increase in performance-based
compensation expense, an $8.8 million increase in computer infrastructure cost related to cloud business transition, and a $7.0 million
increase in other compensation and other personnel-related expenses resulting from increased headcount in professional services.
