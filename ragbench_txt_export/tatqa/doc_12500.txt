Under the provisions of the $400 million letter of credit, the terms allow for a stepped reduction in the value of the guarantee over time and thus, conversely, a reduction in the cash collateral requirements. In 2017, the $400 million letter of credit and the cash collateral requirement was reduced to $300 million and $174.6 million, respectively, with no further reduction in 2018. In 2019, the letter of credit was reduced to $250.0 million and a contractual amendment further reduced the letter of credit to $125.0 million and the cash collateral to $76.0 million. There is no further contractual reduction expected until 2021.
