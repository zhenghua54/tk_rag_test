Revenue from PSG decreased by $249.9 million, or approximately 8%, which was due to a combination of a decrease in volume of products sold and a competitive pricing environment. The revenue in our Protection and Signal Division, Integrated Circuits Division, and High Power Division, decreased by $106.5 million, $96.6 million and $91.5 million, respectively. This was partially offset by an increase in revenue of $30.1 million and $15.0 million from our Foundry Services and Power Mosfet Division, respectively.
