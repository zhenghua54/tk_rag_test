On April 4, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of MGI Grain Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, now conducting business as MGI Grain Incorporated (MGI) for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million. The purchase price included $0.3 million deposited in an escrow account at closing which was subsequently released to the sellers in June 2019. MGI owns and operates a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. We acquired MGI as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of MGIâ€™s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning April 4, 2019. In 2019, we incurred $0.1 million of MGI acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
