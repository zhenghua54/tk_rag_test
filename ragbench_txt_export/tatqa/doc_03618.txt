Income Tax Expense. Our income tax expense was $12.7 million for 2018 and $25.2 million for 2017. The decrease in our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in deferred income tax expense for 2017 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Act. The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code and reduced the corporate tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat 21% rate. The rate reduction was effective on January 1, 2018 and may reduce our future income taxes payable once we become a cash taxpayer in the United States. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and other provisions under the Act, we were required to revalue our net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 resulting in a reduction in our net deferred tax asset of $9.0 million and we also recorded a transition tax of $2.3 million related to our foreign operations for a total income tax expense of approximately $11.3 million, which was recorded as additional noncash income tax expense in 2017.
