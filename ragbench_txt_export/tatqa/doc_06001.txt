Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Approximately half of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 28, 2019, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $498 million.
