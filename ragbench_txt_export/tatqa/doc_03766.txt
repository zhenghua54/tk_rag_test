Deferred contract costs are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of a deferred cost exceeds the remaining amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the goods and services related to the cost, less the expected costs related directly to providing those goods and services that have not yet been recognized as expenses. There have been no impairment charges recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
