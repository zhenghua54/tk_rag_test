3 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted net income are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See “Non-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures” for information about these measures, including how we calculate them.
