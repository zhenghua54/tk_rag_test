As at 1 July 2018, the Group held a contractual agreement for the sale of the land and buildings of the Croydon self-storage centre for $5.8m, less cost of sale of $0.1m. This resulted in this asset being classified as held for sale. Due to unforeseen circumstances outside of the Groupâ€™s control this transaction did not proceed. At 30 June 2019 the asset has been classified as freehold investment property and is no longer held for sale.
