Sequencing and molecular analysis revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 44.6% from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflected lower volume of GPS samples sequenced and recognized as revenue in the current year resulting from deliveries for patients covered by contract and non-contracted payers. Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement. As we gain additional insurance coverage, including coverage under government insurance programs, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of sequencing and molecular analysis revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.
