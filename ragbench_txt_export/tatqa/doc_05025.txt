Income tax expense for fiscal 2019 was $17.3 million compared to $94.6 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the $85.9 million impact of Tax
Reform that was recorded in fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions
("GILTI") of Tax Reform in fiscal 2019. Income tax expense also decreased by $10.5 million in fiscal 2019 as the Company reasserted that certain historical
undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested based on the expected working capital requirements of these two foreign
subsidiaries.
