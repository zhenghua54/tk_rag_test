The spectrum auction bidding took place across the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years. Whilst £325m was on deposit with Ofcom at 31 March 2018, we went on to acquire spectrum for a total price of £304m and the excess deposit balance has since been refunded. We made pension deficit payments of £2,024m (2017/18: £872m) and paid dividends to our shareholders of £1,504m (2017/18: £1,523m).
