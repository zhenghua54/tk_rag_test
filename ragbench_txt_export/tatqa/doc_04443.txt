Year 2018 compared with year 2017 Software license revenue decreased $26.9 million to $45.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was influenced by (1) extended sales cycles and evaluations for some of our contracts, and (2) the business transition to cloud subscriptions, which resulted in traditional perpetual license deals closing as cloud deals based on customer demand. License revenue for the Americas and EMEA segments decreased $15.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively, in 2018 over 2017, while license revenue for the APAC segment increased $0.3 million. The perpetual license sales percentage mix across our product suite in 2018 was approximately 80% warehouse management solutions.
