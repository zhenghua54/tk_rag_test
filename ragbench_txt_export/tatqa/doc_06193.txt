Notes: 1 Liabilities for payments due to holders of the equity shares in Kabel Deutschland AG under the terms of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement are now separately disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position and are no longer presented within short-term borrowings; gross short-term borrowings at 31 March 2018 have therefore been revised to exclude â‚¬1,838 million in respect of such liabilities.
