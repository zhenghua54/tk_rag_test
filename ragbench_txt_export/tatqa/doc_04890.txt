Our policy is to declare quarterly dividends to shareholders as decided by the Board of Directors. The dividend to shareholders could be higher than the operating cash flow or the dividend to shareholders could be lower than the operating cash flow after reserves as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine are required, taking into account contingent liabilities, the terms of our borrowing agreements, our other cash needs and the requirements of Bermuda law.
