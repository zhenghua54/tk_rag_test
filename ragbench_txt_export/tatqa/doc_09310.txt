Our cash and cash equivalents in recent years have been favorably affected by our implementation of an equity-based bonus program for our employees, including executives. In connection with that bonus program, in February 2019, we issued 0.3 million freely-tradable shares of our common stock in settlement of bonus awards for the 2018 performance period. We expect to implement a similar equity-based plan for fiscal 2019, but our compensation committee retains discretion to effect payment in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
