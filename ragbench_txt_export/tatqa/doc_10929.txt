Sales and marketing expenses decreased $15.6 million, or 7%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased by approximately eight percentage points, primarily resulting from a combination of increased cost efficiency, reduction in headcount as part of our restructuring activities, and leverage realized from changes to our sales commission plans as we continued our efforts to strategically scale our sales teams and improve their productivity.
