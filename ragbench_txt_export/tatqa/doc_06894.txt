The tax charge for the year is based on the standard rate of UK corporation tax for the period of 19% (2018: 19%). Deferred income taxes have been measured at the tax rate expected to be applicable at the date the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are realised. Management has performed an assessment, for all material deferred income tax assets and liabilities, to determine the period over which the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are forecast to be realised, which has resulted in an average deferred income tax rate of 17% being used to measure all deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2019 (2018: 17%).
