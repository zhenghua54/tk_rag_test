Revenue from the provision of recurring monthly service fees is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. Project fees are primarily comprised of installation services relating to a customer's initial deployment. As this is not considered to be a distinct service, revenue is deferred and recognised over the term of the contract with the customer, taking into account renewal options that are held by the customer. Upfront discounts provided to customers are contract assets that are amortised over the expected contract life - refer to Note 6(b).
