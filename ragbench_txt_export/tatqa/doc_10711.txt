As of January 31, 2019, Autodesk had total billed and unbilled deferred revenue of $2.7 billion, which represents the total contract price allocated to undelivered performance obligations, which are generally recognized over the next three years. We expect to recognize $1.9 billion or 72% of this revenue during the next 12 months. We expect to recognize the remaining $0.8 billion or 28% of this revenue thereafter.
