The following table presents the unaudited pro forma financial results as if the 2019 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2018 and the 2018 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2017. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies, costs or other integration impacts. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the transactions been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of the Company.
