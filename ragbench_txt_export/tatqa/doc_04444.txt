Maintenance Revenue
Year 2019 compared with year 2018
Maintenance revenue increased $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to (1) an increase in the first-year maintenance revenue; (2) our annual renewal rate of customers subscribing to maintenance, which was greater than 90%; and (3) increases in the maintenance renewal prices. Maintenance revenue for the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments increased $1.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, compared to 2018.
