We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spend on research and development efforts, employee headcount, marketing and sales activities, acquisitions of additional businesses and technologies, the timing and extent of exchange of the Notes for payments of cash, the introduction of new software and services offerings, enhancements to our existing software and services offerings and the continued market acceptance of our products.
