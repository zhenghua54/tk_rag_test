On October 27, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement to sell the Compute business. In consideration for the transfer and sale of the Compute business, we received an equity interest in the buyer valued at approximately $36.5 million, representing the carrying value of the assets divested and representing less than 20.0% of the buyer's total outstanding equity. The operations of the Compute business were accounted for as discontinued operations through the date of divestiture.
