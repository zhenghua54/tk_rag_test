(1) On August 1, 2019, $8.6 million in cash was initially recorded as Other receivables in our preliminary opening balance sheet as disclosed in the table included in our third quarter 2019 Form 10-Q filing. The Company determined this balance should be reflected in Cash as the amount was settled to Automated on the day of purchase. This change had no impact on consideration paid or on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019.
