As of December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $18.3 million, consisting of pre-2018 losses in the amount of approximately $14.3 million that expire from 2020 through 2037, and post-2017 losses in the amount of approximately $4 million that never expire. These net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income. The Company was formed in 2006 as a limited liability company and changed to a corporation in 2007. Activity prior to incorporation is not reflected in the Companyâ€™s corporate tax returns. In the future, the cumulative net operating loss carry-forward for income tax purposes may differ from the cumulative financial statement loss due to timing differences between book and tax reporting.
