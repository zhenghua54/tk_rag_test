Prior to this quarter, all financial asset derivatives were current financial assets and so reduced net debt. Following a recent review we now also have financial asset derivatives that are non-current in nature. As all of these derivatives relate to financial liabilities, we continue to exclude them for the purposes of our net debt calculation and have expanded our definition to reflect this.
