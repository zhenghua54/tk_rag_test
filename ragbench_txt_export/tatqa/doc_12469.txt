In August 2018, ThinxNet commenced a subsequent financing transaction to raise additional funds for working capital purposes. In connection with this transaction, we converted approximately $300,000 of outstanding accounts receivable due from ThinxNet into additional ownership interest in an in-kind exchange of assets. Based on the fair value of ThinxNet at the time of conversion, we revalued the initial ownership interest and recorded an impairment charge of $326,000, which is netted within Investment Income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). Effective March 2019, we notified ThinxNet that we expect the outstanding loan to be repaid in June 2019.
