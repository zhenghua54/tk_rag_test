The Tax Act includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries, a special deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. These provisions of the Tax Act became effective for us beginning on August 1, 2018 and had no impact on the tax benefit for fiscal year 2019.
