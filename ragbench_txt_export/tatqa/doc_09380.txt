Net cash provided by financing activities â€“ continuing operations increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to inflows resulting from (i) the issuance of the 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes, (ii) lower credit facility payments, partially offset with less credit facility borrowings and (iii) a decrease in the repurchase of common stock. These were partially offset by the purchase of the remaining minority interest in Pulse8 during 2019.
