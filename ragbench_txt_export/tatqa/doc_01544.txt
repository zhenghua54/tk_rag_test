The fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their market values as of their respective grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends. The vesting conditions and related terms of our PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined, fixed and based upon consistent U.S. GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined, fixed and consistently determined, and that require the employee to render service. Therefore, these awards met the performance-based award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718.
