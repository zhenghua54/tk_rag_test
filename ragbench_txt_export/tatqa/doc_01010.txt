Prices for wafers of a given level of technology generally decline over the processing technology life cycle. As a result, we have continuously been migrating to increasingly sophisticated technologies to maintain the same level of profitability. We began our volume production with 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer technologies in 2006 and 2009, respectively. We introduced our 28-nanometer technology to customers in 2011 and started large-scale commercial production in 2014. Our 28nm and below technologies contributed approximately 17.1%, 15.2% and 11.3% of our foundry revenue in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.
