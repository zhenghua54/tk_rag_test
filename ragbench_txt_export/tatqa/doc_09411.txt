The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $68.2. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $1.8 in 2019 and are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $8.7 at December 31, 2019 and $6.9 at December 31, 2018. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by a net $6.3, mainly due to anticipated statute of limitations lapses in various jurisdictions.
