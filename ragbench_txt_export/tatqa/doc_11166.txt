Gross profit increased $216.0 million, or 56.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, gross profit decreased from 56.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 55.6% in the year ended December 31, 2018, due to Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue, increasing the functionality and flexibility of our hosting infrastructure, and higher product costs associated with expanding our product offerings. This was partly offset by the relative growth of higher-margin merchant solutions products, namely referral fees from partners, Shopify Capital, and Shopify Shipping.
