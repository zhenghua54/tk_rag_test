Under the performance-based incentive program, each participant is given a target award expressed as a number of shares, with a payout opportunity ranging from 0% to 120% of the target, depending on performance relative to predetermined goals. An estimate of the number of PSAs that are expected to vest is made, and the fair value of the PSAs is expensed utilizing the fair value on the date of grant over the requisite service period.
