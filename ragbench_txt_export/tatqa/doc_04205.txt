Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.
