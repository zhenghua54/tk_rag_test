The performance goal for each of the three-year performance period ending in fiscal 2020 (the "2020 performance period") and the three-year performance period ending in 2021 ("2021 performance period") is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. In addition, for certain participants, all performance shares for the 2020 performance period are subject to an overarching EPS goal that must be met in each fiscal year of the 2020 performance period before any payout on the performance shares can be made to such participants. For each of the 2020 performance period and the 2021 performance period, the awards actually earned will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period.
