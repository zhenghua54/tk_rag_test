In September 2016, we announced changes to retirement plans we offer to certain employees. Benefits accrued to eligible participants of our largest qualified defined benefit pension plan and certain non-qualified pension plans were frozen effective December 31, 2016. Approximately 1,900 affected employees were transitioned to the Companyâ€™s 401(k) plan that has been in effect for eligible employees since 2012, when the pension plan was closed to new entrants. We recognized the plan freeze during fiscal year 2017 as a curtailment, since it eliminated the accrual for a significant number of participants for all of their future services. We also made a voluntary pension contribution of $100.0 million to the affected plan in October 2016.
