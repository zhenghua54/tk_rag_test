For illustrative purposes only, had we accounted for revenues under proforma Topic 605, license revenues would have been $390.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which would have been lower by approximately $47.1 million or 10.8% as compared to the prior fiscal year; and would have been lower by 8.4% after factoring the impact of $10.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change would have been attributable to a decrease in Americas of $17.7 million, a decrease in EMEA of $15.7 million and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $13.7 million.
