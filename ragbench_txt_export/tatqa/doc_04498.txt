During the years ended December 31, 2017, pursuant to the Company’s 2016 Incentive Plan and 2005 Incentive Plan, the Company granted RSAs. The awards have requisite service periods of three years and vest in increments of 33% on the anniversary of the grant dates. Under each arrangement, shares are issued without direct cost to the employee. RSAs granted to our board vest one year from grant or as of the next annual shareholders meeting, whichever is earlier. The Company estimates the fair value of the RSAs based upon the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. The RSA grants provide for the payment of dividends on the Company’s common stock, if any, to the participant during the requisite service period, and the participant has voting rights for each share of common stock. The Company recognizes compensation expense for RSAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
