The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on customer payment levels, historical experience and management’s views on trends in the overall receivable agings. In addition, for larger accounts, we perform analyses of risks on a customer-specific basis. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and management believes that an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided.
