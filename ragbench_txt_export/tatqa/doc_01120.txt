As required by the authoritative accounting guidance on accounting for income taxes, the Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to reduce its existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense. For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $1.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively.
