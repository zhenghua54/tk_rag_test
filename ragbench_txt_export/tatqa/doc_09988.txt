At December 31, 2019, $6.7 million of the $539.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was held by foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were used to fund domestic operations, they would be subject to additional income taxes upon repatriation.
