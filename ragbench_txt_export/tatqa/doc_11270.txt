The main factors for the increase in total equity attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG were € 5.2 billion in net income attributable to shareholders of Siemens AG; the re-issuance of treasury shares of € 1.6 billion; and positive other comprehensive income, net of income taxes of € 0.4 billion, resulting mainly from positive currency translation effects of € 1.8 billion, partly offset by negative effects from remeasurements of defined benefit plans of € 1.1 billion. This increase was partly offset by dividend payments of € 3.1 billion (for fiscal 2018) and the repurchase of 13,532,557 treasury shares at an average cost per share of € 99.78, totaling € 1.4 billion (including incidental transaction charges).
