These reductions in the working capital deficit were offset in part by the recognition of current lease liabilities of $6.2 million at December 31, 2019 as part of the adoption on January 1, 2019 of ASU No. 2016- 02, Leases. Working capital was also impacted by a decline in accounts receivable of $13.1 million compared to December 31, 2018.
