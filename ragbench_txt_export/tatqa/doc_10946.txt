Deferred purchase price - In May 2017, the Golar Tundra had not commenced her charter and, accordingly, Golar Partners elected to exercise the Tundra Put Right to require us to repurchase Tundra Corp at a price equal to the original purchase price. In connection with Golar Partners exercising the Tundra Put Right, we and Golar Partners entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase Tundra Corp from Golar Partners on the date of the closing of the Tundra Put Sale in return we will be required to pay an amount equal to $107.2 million (the "Deferred Purchase Price") plus an additional amount equal to 5% per annum of the Deferred Purchase Price (the "Additional Amount"). The Deferred Purchase Price and the Additional Amount was applied to the net sale price of the Hilli Disposal (defined below) on July 12, 2018. We have accounted for $nil, $2.9 million and $1.1 million as interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
