The Group operates a SAYE under which all eligible UK employees may save up to a maximum of Â£500 per month for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds at the end of their saving period to purchase shares in the Company. At the start of the saving period, each SAYE participant will be granted an option to purchase such shares at a price usually determined as the average mid-market closing share price of an ordinary share in the Company over the three consecutive dealing days preceding the SAYE invitation date, discounted by up to 20 per cent. Options may normally be exercised within six months following the end of the savings period.
