The work surrounding a significant change report and a profit estimate requires the accountant to have detailed knowledge of the Group. If a firm other than the audit firm were to undertake this work, they would require a significant amount of additional time to become familiar with the Group. PwC was therefore chosen to undertake this work as it was considered to be sensible and more efficient both in terms of time and costs.
