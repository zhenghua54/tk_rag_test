We estimate that we have available state NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 of $758.5 million and related deferred tax assets of $16.7 million. The state NOL carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2039. Management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize state NOL carryforwards of $80.3 million and related deferred tax asset of $5.2 million and has placed a valuation allowance on this amount.
