As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4.4 million, $4.2 million
and $3.8 million, respectively. Accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized as part of
our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations and is immaterial for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income
tax benefits is to include such items in income tax expense.
