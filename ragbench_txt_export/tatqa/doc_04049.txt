Sales and marketing expenses in 2019 decreased by $7.6 million, or 32%, as compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the global sales support and marketing headcount, including reductions that were part of our restructuring activities during 2019 (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), contributing to net decreases of $4.8 million in personnel-related costs, and $1.0 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2018. Restructuring costs in 2019 decreased $0.4 million, as there were additional restructuring activities in 2018, including a headcount reduction of approximately 13% of our workforce and the closure of certain leased facilities. The remaining decrease during 2019 was primarily the result of lower marketing costs of $0.6 million, as we eliminated or shifted the timing of certain of our marketing activities.
