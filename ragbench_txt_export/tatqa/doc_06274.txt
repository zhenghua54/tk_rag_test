Cost of subscription solutions increased $10.7 million, or 39.9%, for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was due to an increase in the costs necessary to support a greater number of merchants using our platform, resulting in an increase in: infrastructure and hosting costs, employee-related costs, credit card fees for processing merchant billings, amortization of technology related to enhancing our platform, payments to third-party partners for the registration of domain names, and payments to third-party theme developers. As a percentage of revenues, cost of subscription solutions decreased from 7.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2018 to 7.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2019 due to subscription solutions representing a smaller percentage of our total revenues.
