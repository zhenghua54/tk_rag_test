Prior to the effective date of the reclassification and demerger of CECONOMY AG on 12 July 2017, METRO AG was not yet a group within the meaning of IFRS 10. Accordingly, combined financial statements of METRO Wholesale & Food Specialist GROUP (hereinafter: MWFS GROUP) were prepared for the IPO prospectus of METRO AG. Equity in the combined financial statements was the residual amount from the combined assets and liabilities of MWFS GROUP. Following the demerger, METRO became an independent group with METRO AG as the listed parent company. Therefore, the equity in the consolidated financial statements is subdivided according to legal requirements. The subscribed capital of €363 million and the capital reserve of €6,118 million were recognised at the carrying amounts from the METRO AG Annual Financial Statements as of 30 September 2017. For this purpose, a transfer was made from the equity item net assets, recognised as of 1 October 2016, attributable to the former METRO GROUP of the combined financial statements of MWFS GROUP. The remaining negative amount of this equity item was reclassified to reserves retained from earnings. It cannot be traced back to a history of loss.
