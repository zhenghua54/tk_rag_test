Goodwill, trademarks and tradenames are considered to have indefinite useful lives and therefore no amortization has been taken on these assets. The Company’s retail reporting unit recorded intangible asset (trademarks and tradenames) impairment charges of approximately $2.9 million during fiscal 2019 and goodwill impairment charges of approximately $1.9 million during fiscal 2018 when it was determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their fair values. These impairment charges arose from a range of considerations including, but not limited to, heightened competition in the industry, retail sector market conditions, and earning shortfalls which impacted the Company’s projections of future cash flows to be generated. These impairment charges were recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations as a component of operating income.
