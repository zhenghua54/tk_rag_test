Leases primarily relate to the Groupâ€™s properties, which principally comprise offices and factories. Lease payments are typically subject to market review every five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not been reflected in the table below. Within our leasing arrangements there are no significant contingent rental, renewal, purchase or escalation clauses.
