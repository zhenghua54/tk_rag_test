In November 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets comprising the business of Golden Ridge Rice Mills, LLC, now conducting business as Golden Ridge Rice Mills, Inc. (Golden Ridge). The primary activity of the business is the operation of a rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas. We acquired the business as part of our strategy to vertically integrate in order to leverage our proprietary technologies for producing SRB and derivative products. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridgeâ€™s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018. In 2018, we incurred $0.1 million of Golden Ridge acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
