A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $84 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.
