During fiscal year 2018, cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to $164.0 million in net cash received attributable to the bargain purchase of TOKIN. Additionally, we had proceeds from asset sales of $3.6 million and received dividends of $2.7 million. This was partially offset by capital expenditures of $65.0 million, primarily related to expanding capacity at our manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Portugal, China, Thailand and Japan, as well as for information technology projects in the United States and Mexico. In addition, the Company invested $3.0 million in the form of capital contributions to Novasentis.
