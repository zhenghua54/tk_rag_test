Adjusted Gross Margin. Adjusted gross margin represents gross profit plus amortization of acquired intangibles and stock-based compensation. Adjusted gross margin is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis.
