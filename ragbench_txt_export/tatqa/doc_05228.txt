For fiscal year 2018, the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). The effective income tax rates for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were also impacted by a lower income tax rate in many foreign jurisdictions in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, changes in valuation allowance, research and development tax credits, and a fair market value adjustment of warrant liabilities.
