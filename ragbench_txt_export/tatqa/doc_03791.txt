The following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2016 and 2015 were not recast. Net income for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has been impacted by the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) of 2017, and fiscal 2018 net income contains the related adjustment for the re-measurement of deferred taxes. Acquisitions have affected revenue and net income in fiscal 2019 as well as the historical periods presented.
