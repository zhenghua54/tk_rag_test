The 2017 tax provision primarily results from state taxes, taxes withheld in foreign jurisdictions and foreign tax expense. The 2017 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.
