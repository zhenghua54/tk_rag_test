Our capital expenditure program includes, among other things, restaurant remodeling, information technology enhancements, and investments in new locations and equipment. In 2019, capital expenditures increased by $9.8 million primarily due to an increase of $16.2 million in purchases of assets intended for sale or sale and leaseback, partially offset by a $8.7 million decrease in restaurant capital maintenance and facility improvement spending mainly from a decrease in the average number of company-operated restaurants compared to the prior year. The increase in purchases of assets intended for sale or sale and leaseback was primarily due to the Companyâ€™s purchase of a commercial property in Los Angeles, California, on which an existing company restaurant and another retail tenant are located. The purchase price was $17.3 million, and we currently intend to sell the entire property and lease back the parcel on which our company operated restaurant is located within the next 12 months.
