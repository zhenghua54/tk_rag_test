iSelect calculates its provision utilising historical credit loss experience, adjusted for other relevant factors, i.e. aging of receivables, credit rating of the debtor, etc. Debts that are known to be uncollectable are written off when identified. If an impairment allowance has been recognised for a debt that becomes uncollectable, the debt is written off against the provision. If an amount is subsequently recovered, it is credited against profit or loss.
