Various components of our ERP system became ready for their intended use and were placed into service at various times from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019. As each component became ready for its intended use, the componentâ€™s costs were transferred into completed software and we began amortizing these costs over their seven-year estimated useful life using the straight-line method. We continue to capitalize costs associated with the development of other ERP components that are not yet ready for their intended use.
