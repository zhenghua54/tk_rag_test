The negative swing in Corporate items was mainly due to large positive effects in fiscal 2018 – the gain of € 900 million resulting from the transfer of Siemens’ shares in Atos SE to Siemens Pension- Trust e. V. and the gain of € 655 million from the sale of OSRAM Licht AG shares. These effects substantially outweighed a positive result in fiscal 2019 from the measurement of a major asset retirement obligation, which was previously reported in Centrally managed portfolio activities. Severance charges within Corporate items were € 99 million (€ 159 million in fiscal 2018).
