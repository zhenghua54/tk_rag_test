The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate for its controlled businesses for the year ended 31 March 2019 was 24.4% compared to 20.6% for the last financial year. The higher rate in the current year is primarily due to a change in the mix of the Group’s profit, driven by the financing for the Liberty Global transaction. The tax rate in the prior year also reflected the consequences of closing tax audits in Germany and Romania. We expect the Group’s adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the low-mid twenties range for the medium term.
