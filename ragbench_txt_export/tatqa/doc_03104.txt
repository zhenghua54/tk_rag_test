On November 1, 2019, we completed the purchase of real estate in Chandler, Arizona for approximately $48,000,000 that we intend to use as our global corporate headquarters. The property contains a building and some infrastructure in place that we will complete readying for our use over the next year. We intend to sell our current properties in Tempe, Arizona.
