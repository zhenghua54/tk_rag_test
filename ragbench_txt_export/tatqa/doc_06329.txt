Our overall revenue increased $116.8 million in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher demand for our mobile products in support of customers based in China as well as higher demand for our base station products, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to weakness in marquee smartphone demand experienced by our largest end customer.
