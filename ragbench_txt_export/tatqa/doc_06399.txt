During the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2019 and second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded $2.3 million and $80.8 million, respectively, primarily related to the legal settlement of several antitrust claims against the Company. Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. This resulted in an initial revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities during the third quarter which favorably impacted our results by $35.0 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we completed our analysis of the Act and recorded additional tax benefit of $8.0 million.
