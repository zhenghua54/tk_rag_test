In fiscal 2017, due to declining sales of certain brands, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles of those brands. During fiscal 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $31.5 million for our Del Monte速 brand and $5.5 million for our Aylmer速 brand in our International segment. We also recognized impairment charges of $67.1 million for our Chef Boyardee速 brand and $1.1 million for our Fiddle Faddle速 brand in our Grocery & Snacks segment.
