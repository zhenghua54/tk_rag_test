The decrease in valuation allowance during the year ended March 31, 2017 was also due to the reversal of valuation allowances of $5,530 related to the future
utilization of NOLs totaling $15,878 at a Japanese subsidiary. The related tax benefits upon utilization of the Japanese NOLs expire eight years after they are generated,
and they are not subject to annual utilization limitations. The realization of tax benefits due to the utilization of these NOLs could take an extended period of time to
realize and are dependent upon the Japanese subsidiary’s continuing profitability, and some could expire prior to utilization. The increase in valuation allowance during
the year ended March 31, 2019, was due to the addition of valuation allowances of $3,124 related to the Ethertronics acquisition and $1,763 related to capital and section
1231 losses at AVX Corporation.
