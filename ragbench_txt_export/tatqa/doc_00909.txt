AASB 15 establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entityâ€™s contracts with customers and requires application of a five-step process to identify the contract with the customer, identify performance obligations in the contract, determine transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognise revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.
