Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) uses segment revenues, gross profit and income from operations as measures of performance and to make decisions about the allocation of resources. In determining these performance measures, we do not include in revenue the amortization of acquisition- related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue acquired in a business combination. We also exclude the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs, and non-cash asset impairment charges from the operating segment data provided to our CODM. Non-recurring expenses relate to certain severance, product consolidation, legal, consulting and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in our reportable segment results and are included in an “Unallocated Amounts” category within our segment disclosure. The “Unallocated Amounts” category also includes (i) corporate general and administrative expenses (including marketing expenses) and certain research and development expenses related to common solutions and resources that benefit all of our business units (refer to discussion above), all of which are centrally managed and (ii) revenue and the associated cost from the resale of certain ancillary products, primarily hardware. We do not track our assets by segment.
