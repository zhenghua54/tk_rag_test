Teekay Tankers' income from vessel operations increased to $123.9 million in 2019 compared to $7.2 million in 2018, primarily as a result of: • an increase of $129.3 million due to higher overall average realized spot tanker rates earned by Teekay Tankers' Suezmax, Aframax and LR2 product tankers; • an increase of $3.5 million due to improved net results from Teekay Tankers' full service lightering (or FSL) activities from more voyage days and higher realized spot rates earned;
