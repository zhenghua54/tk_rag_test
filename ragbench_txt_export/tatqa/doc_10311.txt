Non-hazardous waste produced by the Group’s office buildings mainly includes domestic waste and non-hazardous office waste. Domestic waste is disposed of by the property management companies and kitchen waste recycling vendors, and its data is not available, therefore estimation of domestic waste is made with reference to “Handbook on Domestic Discharge Coefficients for Towns in the First Nationwide Census on Contaminant Discharge” published by the State Council. Non-hazardous office waste is centralised for disposal by vendors; hence such data covers all office buildings of the Group in Mainland China.
