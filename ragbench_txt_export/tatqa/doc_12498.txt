(1) Restricted cash relating to the share repurchase forward swap refers to the collateral required by the bank with whom we entered into a total return equity swap. Collateral of 20% of the total purchase price is required and this is subsequently adjusted with reference to the Company's share price. In November 2019, we purchased 1.5 million shares underlying the total return equity swap that resulted in $54.7 million of restricted cash being released (see note 24).
