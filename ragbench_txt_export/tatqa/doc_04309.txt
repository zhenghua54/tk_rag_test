Cost of Hardware
As discussed above, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018. As a result, we now recognize our
hardware revenue net of related costs which reduces both hardware revenue and cost of sales as compared to our accounting prior to
2018. Had we presented the results for 2017 under ASC 606, cost of hardware would have been presented as zero as we would have
recognized our hardware revenue net of related costs. In 2019, cost of hardware decreased $3.5 million compared to 2018 on
decreased hardware sales, while in 2018, cost of hardware increased $3.7 million compared with 2017 on increased hardware sales
