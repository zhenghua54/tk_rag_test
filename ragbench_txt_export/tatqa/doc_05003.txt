The independent members of the Board consulted with the committee and the committee’s compensation consultant to determine the appropriate amount and vesting schedule for Mr. Archer’s award. The independent members of the Board, on December 6, 2018, granted to Mr. Archer a $5,000,000 equity award consisting of 50% service-based RSUs and 50% stock options with a four-year vesting schedule, as shown below. No adjustment was made at that time to his annual base salary or his target award opportunities under the AIP or LTIP. These were adjusted to be competitive with CEOs in our peer group as part of the normal annual compensation review in February 2019.
