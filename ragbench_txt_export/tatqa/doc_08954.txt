We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment whenever applicable facts and circumstances indicate a change in the estimated useful life of an asset may have occurred. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain core Series 6 manufacturing equipment from 10 years to 15 years. Such revision was primarily due to the validation of certain aspects of our Series 6 module technology, including the nature of the manufacturing process, the operating and maintenance cost profile of the manufacturing equipment, and the technologyâ€™s compatibility with our long-term module technology roadmap. We expect the revised useful lives to reduce depreciation by approximately $15.0 million per year. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment was $176.4 million, $109.1 million, and $91.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
