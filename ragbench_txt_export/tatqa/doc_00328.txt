For illustrative purposes only, had we accounted for revenues under proforma Topic 605, customer support revenues would have been $1,246.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which would have been higher by approximately $13.8 million or 1.1% as compared to the prior fiscal year; and would have been up 3.0% after factoring the impact of $23.3 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change would have been attributable to an increase in Americas of $13.0 million and an increase in EMEA of $2.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in Asia Pacific of $1.9 million.
