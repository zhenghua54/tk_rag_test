We recognized an income tax benefit of $8.3 million for fiscal year 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $18.5 million for fiscal year 2018. The fiscal year 2018 income tax provision was primarily due to a one-time provisional net charge from re-measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities in the quarter ended January 31, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
