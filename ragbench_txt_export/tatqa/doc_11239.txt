For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million. This was primarily as a result of our net loss of $64.6 million, which once adjusted for $95.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, $27.1 million of amortization and depreciation, a $5.9 million increase of our provision for uncollectible merchant cash advances, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.3 million, contributed $65.4 million of positive cash flows. Additional cash of $38.1 million resulted from the following increases in operating liabilities: $20.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities; $9.0 million in deferred revenue; and $8.4 million in lease liabilities. These were offset by $94.2 million of cash used resulting from the following increases in operating assets: $50.7 million in merchant cash advances and loans; $32.6 million in trade and other receivables; and $10.8 million in other current assets.
