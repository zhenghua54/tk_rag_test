On June 28, 2019 as part of the changes made to the loan agreements we had with Mr. Schutte, each having an original due date of January 2, 2020, we issued to him a warrant to purchase 10.0 million shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of $0.01 per share and expire five years after issuance. We obtained a valuation of fair value on the warrant and $1.145 million was allocated to the warrant and accounted for as equity. (see Note 7 and Note 8). The warrant was assigned and transferred by Mr. Schutte to AD Pharma on June 28, 2019.
