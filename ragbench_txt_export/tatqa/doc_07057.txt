1 These credits regards R&D credits generated in the US, in the state of Arizona. However, ASMI does not recognize these credits stemming from prior years due to the fact that utilization of prior year credits is only possibly if and when the credits generated in the current year are fully utilized. Given the level of R&D activity in the US, the company does not expect it could fully utilize the credits generated in the current year and, hence, does not expect to benefit from the available credits generated in prior years.
