Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - Net cash used in operating activities was $34.1 million during 2019 compared to $69.9 million cash provided by operating activities during 2018, primarily due to a $74.4 million decrease in net income, a $25.6 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $4.2 million increase in other assets, a $2.1 million increase in accounts and other receivables and a $0.9 million decrease in accrued compensation partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in other long-term liabilities. The decrease in deferred revenue primarily reflects the effect of the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Cash used in operating activities was also affected by a $0.5 million decrease in non-cash charges primarily related to a $3.2 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $0.9 million impairment charge related to the SJ Facility right-of-use lease asset and a $1.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to amortization of right-of-use lease assets and the shortened useful life of the SJ Facility leasehold improvements and a $0.3 million increase in deferred income taxes.
