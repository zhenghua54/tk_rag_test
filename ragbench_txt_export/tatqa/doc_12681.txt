Revenue related to external customers went up moderately yearover- year on growth in nearly all industrial businesses. SGRE and Siemens Healthineers posted the highest growth rates, while revenue at Gas and Power declined moderately in a difficult market environment. The revenue decline in emerging markets was due mainly to lower revenue in Egypt, where in fiscal 2018 Gas and Power recorded sharply higher revenue from large orders.
