The total carrying value of our equity method investments at the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $796.3 million and $776.2 million, respectively. These amounts are included in other assets and reflect our 44% ownership interest in Ardent Mills and 50% ownership interests in other joint ventures. Due to differences in fiscal reporting periods, we recognized the equity method investment earnings on a lag of approximately one month.
