Our operating income in fiscal year 2019 increased to $241.4 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales as compared with $189.3 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2018. Excluding surcharge revenue and special items, adjusted operating margin was 12.5 percent for the fiscal year 2019 and 10.6 percent for the same period a year ago. The increase in the operating margin reflects steady demand and improved product mix coupled with operating cost improvements offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the same period a year ago.
