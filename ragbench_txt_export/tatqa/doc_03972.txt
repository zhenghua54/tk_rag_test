Operating revenue for FY19 was $231.3 million, $0.5 million up on FY18. With Sigma contributing $5.0 million of revenue in June (the first month since acquisition), revenues for the remainder of Hansen excluding Sigma were $4.5 million lower. This decline was a result of lower non-recurring revenues, due primarily to both lower one-off licence fees and reduced project work following the large body of work completed in the first half of FY18 associated with implementing Power of Choice in Australia. Conversely, recurring revenues grew to represent 63% of total operating revenue.
