We paid to FNF a guarantee fee of 1.0% of the outstanding principal of the Senior Notes (as defined in Note 12 â€” Long Term Debt) in exchange for the guarantee by FNF of the Senior Notes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the guarantee fee was included in Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings. On April 26, 2017, the Senior Notes were redeemed, and we are no longer required to pay a guarantee fee.
