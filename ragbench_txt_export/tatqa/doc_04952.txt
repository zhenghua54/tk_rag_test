The U.S. mortgage loan servicing market is comprised of first and second lien mortgage loans. Even through housing downturns, the mortgage loan servicing market generally remains stable, as the total number of first lien mortgage loans outstanding tends to stay relatively constant. The number of second lien mortgage loans outstanding can vary based on a number of factors including loan-to-value ratios, interest rates and lenders' desire to own such loans.
