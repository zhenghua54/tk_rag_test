As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $19.0 of tax-effected U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards. Some of these net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2021 if not utilized. The majority of the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”) Section 382; however, the Company expects to utilize such losses in their entirety prior to expiration. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards decreased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to current year tilization. The Company has approximately $33.7 of tax-effected state net operating loss carryforwards (without regard to federal benefit of state). Some of these net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized. The state net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to Florida and New Jersey, but the Company has smaller net operating losses in various other states. The Company has approximately $65.6 of tax-effected foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Some of these net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses. Additionally, the Company has $5.0 of U.S. federal and state research and develop- ment tax credit carryforwards (without regard to federal benefit of state). Some of these research and development credit carry- forwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized.
