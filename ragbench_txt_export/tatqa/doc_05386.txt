The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. Several other currencies in addition to the reporting currency of US dollar are used, including sterling and the euro. The Group experiences currency exchange differences arising upon retranslation of monetary items (primarily short-term inter-Company balances and long-term borrowings), which are recognised as an expense in the period the difference occurs. The Group endeavours to match cash inflows and outflows in the various currencies; the Group typically invoices its customers in their local currency and pays its local expenses in local currency, as a means to mitigate this risk.
