During fiscal 2019, we formed a joint venture with Lenovo (Beijing) Information Technology Ltd. (“Lenovo”) in China and, in February 2019, contributed assets to the newly formed entity, Lenovo NetApp Technology Limited (“LNTL”), in exchange for a non-controlling 49% equity interest. The group of assets we contributed and derecognized met the definition of a business and included cash, fixed assets, customer relationships and an allocation of goodwill, with an aggregate book value of $7 million. The fair value of our equity interest in LNTL was determined using discounted cash flow techniques to be $80 million, resulting in a non-cash gain of $73 million. We accounted for our ownership interest as an equity method investment and have presented it in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of April 26, 2019. LNTL will be integral to our sales channels strategy in China, acting as a distributor of our offerings to customers headquartered there, and involved in certain OEM sales to Lenovo. It will also endeavor to localize our products and services, and to develop new joint offerings for the China market by leveraging NetApp and Lenovo technologies.
