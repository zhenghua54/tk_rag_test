ADJUSTED EBITDA
The 29% decrease in adjusted EBITDA this year was a result of the
revenue and expense changes described above. Excluding the
impact of the sale of our publishing business in the second quarter
of 2019 and the distribution from Major League Baseball last year,
adjusted EBITDA would have increased by 1% this year.
