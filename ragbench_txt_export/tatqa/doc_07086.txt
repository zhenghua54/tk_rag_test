The 2015 Plan allows the compensation committee to make equity-based incentive awards to our officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants. Initially a total of 5.5 million ordinary shares were reserved for the issuance of awards under the 2015 Plan. This number is subject to adjustment in the event of a share split, share dividend or other change in our capitalization.
