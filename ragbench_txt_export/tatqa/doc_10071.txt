Unrealized (losses) gains on Total Return Swap (or equity swap): In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. The facility has been extended to June 2019. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.7 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a gain of $16.6 million for the same period in 2017. The loss in 2018 is due to the fall in our share price during 2018.
