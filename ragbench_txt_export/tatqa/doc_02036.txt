The Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S2NA with CMI 2018 projections related to membersâ€™ years of birth with long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65 as follows: [["", "2019", "", "2018", ""], ["", "Men", "Women", "Men", "Women"], ["", "Years", "Years", "Years", "Years"], ["Member aged 65 (current life expectancy)", "86.8", "88.9", "87.3", "89.3"], ["Member aged 45 (life expectancy at age 65)", "88.5", "90.7", "89.0", "91.1"]]
