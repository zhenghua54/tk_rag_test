As expected, ROCE at 11.1 % was below the target range set in our Siemens Financial Framework, reflecting in particular the effects from portfolio transactions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Mentor and Mendix at Digital Industries and the merger of Siemens’ wind power business with Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica, S. A. that created SGRE. The decline year-over-year was due both to lower income before interest after tax and to higher average capital employed.
