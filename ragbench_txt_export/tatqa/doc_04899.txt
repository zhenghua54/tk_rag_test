Per share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each of the fiscal years. Stock options and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. The two-class method for computing EPS has not been applied because no outstanding awards contain non-forfeitable rights to participate in dividends. There were no anti-dilutive stock options and restricted stock excluded for fiscal 2019, 41 shares excluded for fiscal 2018, and 32 shares excluded for fiscal 2017.
