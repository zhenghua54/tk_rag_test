The GILTI provisions became effective for the Company in fiscal 2019 and resulted in a net $30.4 million tax expense, consisting of a $70.8 million expense related to the inclusion of unremitted foreign earnings offset by a $40.4 million tax benefit from additional foreign tax credits. The Company has made an accounting policy decision under U.S. GAAP to treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current-period expense (the “period cost method”).
