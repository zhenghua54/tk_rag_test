IMFT: Since 2006, we have owned 51% of IMFT, a joint venture between us and Intel. IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. IMFT manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. In 2018, IMFT discontinued production of NAND and subsequent to that time manufactured 3D XPoint memory. In 2018, we announced that we and Intel will no longer jointly develop 3D XPoint technology beyond the second generation and we substantially completed this cost-sharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020. IMFT sales to Intel were $731 million, $507 million, and $493 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
