Unrealized losses on Total Return Swap: In December 2014, we established a three month facility for a Stock Indexed Total Return Swap Programme or Equity Swap Line with DNB Bank ASA in connection with a share buyback scheme. In November 2019, we repurchased 1.5 million shares underlying the equity swap. The remaining facility has been extended to March 2020. The equity swap derivatives mark-to-market adjustment resulted in a net loss of $30.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $30.7 million for the same period in 2018. The losses in 2019 and 2018 are due to the decline in our share price.
