Revenues from our VAS business increased by 13% year-on-year to RMB200 billion. Online games revenues grew by 10% to RMB114.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to revenue contributions from domestic smart phone games including Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite, as well as increased contributions from our overseas titles such as PUBG Mobile and Supercell titles, partly offset by the revenue decline from PC client games such as DnF. Social networks revenues increased by 17% to RMB85,281 million. The increase mainly reflected revenue growth from digital content services such as live broadcast services and video streaming subscriptions.
