The Corporation is also exposed to credit risk in relation to its trade accounts receivable. To mitigate such risk, the Corporation continuously monitors the financial condition of its customers and reviews the credit history or worthiness of each new large customer. The Corporation establishes an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses related to doubtful accounts. The doubtful accounts allowance is calculated on a specific-identification basis for larger customer accounts receivable and on a statistically derived basis for the remainder.
