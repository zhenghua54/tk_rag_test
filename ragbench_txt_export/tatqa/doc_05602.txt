We use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our revolving credit facility's outstanding balance from a variable rate of interest to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2019, we have agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt through February 2024. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
