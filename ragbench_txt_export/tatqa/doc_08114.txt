Historically, we have granted shares of restricted stock to certain employees that have vested in three equal annual installments on the anniversary dates of their grant. However, beginning in 2019, we altered our approach for these grants to replace the grant of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting with the grant of a combination of restricted stock units ("RSUs") subject to time- based vesting and performance-based vesting. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive a single share of our common stock upon the vesting of the award. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we granted an aggregate of 280,000 RSUs to certain employees. Of the RSUs granted during 2019, 217,000 of such RSUs are subject to time-based vesting and are scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments on the anniversary dates of the grant. The remaining 63,000 RSUs are performance-based awards that will vest based on our achievement of long-term performance goals, in particular, based on our levels of 2021 revenue and operating income. The 63,000 shares issuable upon vesting of the performance-based RSUs represent the maximum payout under our performance-based awards, based upon 150% of our target performance for 2021 revenue and operating income (the payout of such awards based on target performance for 2021 revenue and operating income would be 42,000 shares). In the case of the time-based and performance-based RSUs, vesting is also subject to the employee's continuous service with us through vesting. In 2018, we granted 280,000 shares of restricted stock to certain employees. Shares issued to employees vest in three equal annual installments on the anniversary dates of their grant. In 2019 and 2018, 194,333 and 182,500 shares of restricted stock vested, respectively.
