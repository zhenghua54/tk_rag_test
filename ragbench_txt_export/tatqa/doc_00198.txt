In December 2016, we acquired the 67% remaining interest in Inotera and began consolidating Inotera's operating results. In the periods presented above through December 2016, Inotera sold DRAM products exclusively to us through supply agreements. The cash paid for the Inotera Acquisition was funded, in part, with a term loan of 80 billion New Taiwan dollars and $986 million from the sale of 58 million shares of our common stock. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Acquisition of Inotera."
