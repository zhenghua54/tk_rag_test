The Company’s noncurrent trade accounts receivable result from (1) contracts with customers that include renewal provisions, and (2) contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements. For contracts that include renewal provisions, revenue is recognized up-front upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligations, but payments are received upon renewal. Renewals occur in bi-annual and annual increments over the associated expected contract term, the majority of which range from two to five years. The Company’s contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements generally have three-year terms and are invoiced annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized under multi-year arrangements as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these arrangements.
