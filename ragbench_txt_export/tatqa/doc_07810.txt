Metro continued to grow strongly with further refinement to price, promotional optimisation and range curation. An extra‐small store format was successfully launched in Kirribilli and new stores opened in Rozelle and Kings Cross. At the end of the financial year, 43 Metro‐branded stores and 16 small Woolworths Supermarkets were managed by the Metro team.
