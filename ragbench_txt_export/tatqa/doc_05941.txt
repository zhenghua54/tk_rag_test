We are the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have initial terms of up to five years. Our sales-type lease arrangements contain either a provision whereby the network equipment reverts back to us upon the expiration of the lease or a provision that allows the lessee to purchase the network equipment at a bargain purchase amount at the end of the lease. In addition, our sales-type lease arrangements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The allocation of the consideration between lease and nonlease components is determined by stand-alone selling price by component. The net investment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income. Collectability of sales-type leases is evaluated periodically at an individual customer level.
