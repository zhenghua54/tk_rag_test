Loss from Operations. Medical segment loss from operations decreased $2.8 million to $8.6 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $11.4 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to an improvement in gross profit and lower selling and administrative expenses. Selling and administrative expenses were reduced by lower marketing and professional fee expenses, partially offset by initiatives to reduce overall costs and improve operational profitability of $0.9 million.
