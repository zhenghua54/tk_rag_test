In June 2018, one of the Company's ATBs was berthed to the dock when a third-party ship transiting the channel hit the Company's ATB causing structural damage to the Company's ATB and damage to the dock. The cost of repairs has been covered by existing insurance policies. The Company has filed a lawsuit against the third-party ship seeking recovery of its costs of repairs as well as its lost earnings from the ATB being off-hire for 46 repair days.
