Deferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are summarized in the table below. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $337.6 million expiring between 2020 and 2039. A significant portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation that, under current law, is likely to limit future tax benefits to approximately $3.3 million. Valuation allowances increased by $0.7 million during fiscal year 2019 primarily due to increases in net operating losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized.
