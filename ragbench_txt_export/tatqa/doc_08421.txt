We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although depreciation and amortization are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. We also allocate and disclose restructuring charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment. However, restructuring charges and goodwill are not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA since they are categorized as certain specified items (“Special Items”), in addition to certain transaction and other charges and gains related to acquisitions and divestitures and certain other specific items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The accounting policies of the reportable segments and Corporate are the same as those applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
