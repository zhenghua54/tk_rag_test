(1) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share excluding special tax items, consisting of those related to Tax Reform and a change in our permanent reinvestment assertions related to undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries, as well as restructuring costs and the one-time employee bonus, provide additional insight over the change from the comparative reporting periods by eliminating the effects of special or unusual items.
