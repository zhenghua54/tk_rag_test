We measure our compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions based on fair value of the equity or liability classified instrument. For purposes of estimating the fair value of each stock option unit on the date of grant, we utilize the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility factor of the market price of our common stock (as determined by reviewing our historical public market closing prices). Our accounting for share-based compensation for RSUs is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
