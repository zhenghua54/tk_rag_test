The EIB Loans are comprised of three long-term amortizing credit facilities as part of our R&D funding programs. The first, signed in 2010, is a €350 million multi-currency loan to support our industrial and R&D programs. It was drawn mainly in U.S. dollars for an amount of $321 million and only partially in Euros for an amount of €100 million, of which $55 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
