OpenText's Audit Committee has established a policy of reviewing, in advance, and either approving or not approving, all audit, audit-related, tax and other non-audit services that our independent registered public accounting firm provides to us. This policy requires that all services received from our independent registered public accounting firm be approved in advance by the Audit Committee or a delegate of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated the pre-approval responsibility to the Chair of the Audit Committee. All services that KPMG LLP provided to us in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 have been preapproved by the Audit Committee.
