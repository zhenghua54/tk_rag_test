We estimated the fair values of our stock options that were solely subject to service-based vesting requirements using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options. Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, require the input of assumptions, including stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stock-based compensation expense. The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination. The weighted-average input assumptions used and resulting fair values of our service-based stock options were as follows for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
