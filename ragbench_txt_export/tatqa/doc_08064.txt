Sales: CGD sales decreased 2% to $317.9 million in 2019 compared to $325.2 million in 2018. The timing of sales recognition was impacted by the adoption of ASC 606. Under ASC 606, a number of our CGD contracts, most significantly in air combat training and ground live training, for which revenue was historically recorded upon delivery of products to the customer, are now accounted for on the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. For fiscal 2019, sales were lower from air combat training systems, simulation product development contracts, and international services contracts, partially offset by higher sales from ground combat training systems. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CGD sales of $3.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018.
