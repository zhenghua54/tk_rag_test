This section presents our operating performance, providing commentary on how the revenue and the adjusted EBITDA performance of the Group and its operating segments have developed over the last year. Following the adoption of IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” on 1 April 2018, the Group’s statutory results for the year ended 31 March 2019 are on an IFRS 15 basis, whereas the statutory results for the year ended 31 March 2018 are on an IAS 18 basis as previously reported, with any comparison between the two bases of reporting not being meaningful. As a result, the discussion of our operating financial performance is primarily on an IAS 18 basis for all years presented. See “Alternative performance measures” on page 231 for more information and reconciliations to the closest respective equivalent GAAP measures.
