We reported revenues of $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, down 7.0% from $201.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our net loss was $15.6 million or $0.96 loss per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 versus a net loss of $24.1 million or $1.50 loss per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our year-over-year unfavorable performance was primarily driven by lower Restaurant/Retail hardware revenue and corresponding hardware support service revenue from our traditional tier 1 customers as one of these customers completed significant projects in 2018 which were not repeated in 2019. The Company partially offset these reductions with continued growth in Brink POS revenue, including related SaaS, hardware and support services. The 2018 net loss include a valuation allowance of $14.9 million to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets.
