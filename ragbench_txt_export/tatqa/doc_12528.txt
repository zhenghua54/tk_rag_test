The dilapidation provision relates to certain lease arrangements for office space entered into by the Group. These lease arrangements require the Group to restore each premises to its original condition upon lease termination. Accordingly, the Group records a provision for the present value of the estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the expiration of these leases.
