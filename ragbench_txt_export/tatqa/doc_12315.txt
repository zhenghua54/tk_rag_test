Impairment charges in 2019 included $85 million allocated to indefinite-life intangible assets, and $8 million allocated primarilyÂ to property, plant and equipment. These impairment charges relate to broadcast licences and certain assets for various radio markets within our Bell Media segment. The impairment charges were a result of continued advertising demand and ratings pressures in the industry resulting from audience declines, as well as competitive pressure from streaming services. The charges were determined by comparing the carrying value of the CGUs to their fair value less cost of disposal. We estimated the fair value of the CGUs using both discounted cash flows and market-based valuation models, which include five-year cash flow projections derived from business plans reviewed by senior management for the period of January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024, using a discount rate of 7.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of nil as well as market multiple data from public companies and market transactions. The carrying value of these CGUs was $464 million at December 31, 2019.
