Volatility To estimate volatility for the binomial-lattice model, we consider the implied volatility of exchange-traded options on our stock to estimate short-term volatility, the historical volatility of our common shares during the optionâ€™s contractual term to estimate long-term volatility, and a statistical model to estimate the transition from short-term volatility to long-term volatility.
