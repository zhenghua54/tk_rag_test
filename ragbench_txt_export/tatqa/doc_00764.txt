Restructuring costs decreased by $2.2 million as a result of lower severance expenses, as our general and administrative cost reduction initiative came to its conclusion as planned. Costs of closed restaurants and other increased by $3.8 million, primarily due to a $3.5 million charge recorded in 2019 related to the write- off of software development costs associated with a discontinued technology project. Gains on disposition of property and equipment, net, increased by $7.9 million, primarily due to a $5.7 million gain related to a sale of property and a$0.8 million gain related to an eminent domain transaction in 2019.
