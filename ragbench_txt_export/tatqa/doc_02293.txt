During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during fiscal 2019, we recorded net restructuring charges of $254 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $35 million related primarily to employee severance and facility exit costs in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.
