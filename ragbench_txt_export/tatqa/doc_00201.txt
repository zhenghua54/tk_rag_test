In 2019, we purchased a group annuity contract to transfer the pension benefit obligations and annuity administration for a select group of retirees or their beneficiaries to an annuity provider. Upon issuance of the group annuity contract, the pension benefit obligation of $24.4 million for approximately 500 participants was irrevocably transferred to the annuity provider. The purchase of the group annuity was funded directly by the assets of the Pension Plans. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a pension settlement charge of $6.7 million as a result of the transfer of the pension liability to the annuity provider and other lump sum payments made during the year.
