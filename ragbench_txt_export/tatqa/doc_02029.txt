These results reflected a highly competitive market environment. We expect the power generation market overall to remain challenging with market volume stabilizing at the current level. After years of continuous decline, the volume of the gas turbine market in fiscal 2019 remained on the prior-year level, again being impacted by customer delays of large projects in Asia, Australia, particularly in China, and strong price pressure resulting from intense competition. Customers also showed restraint due to ongoing weak growth in demand for power, combined with uncertainty regarding regulatory developments.
