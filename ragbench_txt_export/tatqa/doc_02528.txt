As of December 31, 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $56.2 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $48.6 million. Of the valuation allowance, $42.8 million was established in the current year primarily related to our domestic deferred tax assets. The remaining $5.8 million established in prior periods related to state research and development credit carryforwards and foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards where we lack sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The remaining $7.6 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believes it is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax assets.
