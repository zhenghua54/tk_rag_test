The Company's ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of Leidos' stock at a discount of up to 15% of the fair market value on the date of purchase. During the first half of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the discount was 5% of the fair market value on the date of purchase, thereby resulting in the ESPP being non-compensatory. Effective the second half of fiscal 2018, the Company increased the discount to 10% of the fair market value on the date of purchase, resulting in the ESPP being compensatory.
