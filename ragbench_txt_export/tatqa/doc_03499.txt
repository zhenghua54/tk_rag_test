Other Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests—During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $523.0 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. In addition, the Company, through a subsidiary of ATC Europe, entered into an agreement with its local partners in France to form Eure-et-Loir Réseaux Mobiles SAS (“Eure-et-Loir”), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers in France. The Company’s controlling interest in Eure-et-Loir is 51% with local partners holding a 49% noncontrolling interest. The agreement provides the local partners with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of Eure-et-Loir to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of Eure-et-Loir. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature requires classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. The value of the Eure-et-Loir interests as of December 31, 2019 was $2.7 million.
