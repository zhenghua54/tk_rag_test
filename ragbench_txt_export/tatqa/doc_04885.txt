On June 24, 2019, the Partnership Agreement was amended, effective June 30, 2019, to eliminate the IDRs in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership to GasLog of 2,532,911 common units and 2,490,000 Class B units (of which 415,000 are Class B-1 units, 415,000 are Class B-2 units, 415,000 are Class B-3 units, 415,000 are Class B-4 units, 415,000 are Class B-5 units and 415,000 are Class B-6 units), issued on June 30, 2019. The Class B units have all of the rights and obligations attached to the common units, except for voting rights and participation in distributions until such time as GasLog exercises its right to convert the Class B units to common units. The Class B units will become eligible for conversion on a one-for-one basis into common units at GasLog’s option on July 1, 2020, July 1, 2021, July 1, 2022, July 1, 2023, July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 for the Class B-1 units, Class B-2 units, Class B-3 units, Class B-4 units, Class B-5 units and the Class B-6 units, respectively. Following the IDR elimination, the allocation of GasLog Partners’ profit to the non-controlling interests is based on the revised distribution policy for available cash stated in the Partnership Agreement as amended, effective June 30, 2019, and under which 98% of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and 2% is distributed to the general partner. The updated earnings allocation applies to the total GasLog Partners’ profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and onwards.
