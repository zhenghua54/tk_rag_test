Maintenance revenues increased $68.0 million, or 21%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in maintenance revenues was primarily attributable to growing renewal of software maintenance contracts from our customers related to our perpetual license software offerings.
