Acquisition costs are related to our acquisitions of RMDY Health in 2019 and CareSpeak Communications in October 2018. These costs include investment banker fees, legal and accounting due diligence, audit costs associated with CareSpeak, valuation experts for the purchase price allocation, and other miscellaneous costs. Since RMDY Health was a larger company than CareSpeak Communications, the costs associated with the acquisition were higher.
