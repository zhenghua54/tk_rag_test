During our fiscal first quarter of 2019, we canceled 1,122,500 performance-based stock options with a concurrent grant of 748,328 PRSUs for 13 employees, which was accounted for as a modification. The incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification was $8.2 million, and was being recognized as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of three years for the new PRSU awards.
