As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
