Our non-GAAP financial measures also include free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less the amount of property and equipment purchased. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to invest in our business and fund ongoing operations.

However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
