With BIG Wâ€™s turnaround gaining momentum, and to build a sustainable network for the future, a store and DC network review was announced in April. BIG W intends to close approximately 30 stores over the next three years and two distribution centres at the end of their leases. The review of the store network is ongoing, with three stores recently announced to be closed in F20.
