We are subject to ongoing audits from various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. As of September 30, 2019, the fiscal years open under the statute of limitations in significant jurisdictions include 2016 through 2019 in the U.S. We believe we have adequately provided for uncertain tax issues we have not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Although not more likely than not, the most adverse resolution of these issues could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods. Based upon a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax issues for all open tax periods will have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
