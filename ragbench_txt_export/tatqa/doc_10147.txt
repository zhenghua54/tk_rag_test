The valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets as of March 29, 2019, increased primarily due to a corresponding increase in unrealized capital losses from equity investments, certain acquired tax loss and tax credits carryforwards, and California research and development credits. Based on our current operations, these attributes are not expected to be realized, and a valuation allowance has been recorded to offset them.
