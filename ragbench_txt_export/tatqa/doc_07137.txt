Based on available cash, we may utilize a portion of the dividend savings to reduce our longterm debt or repurchase additional amounts of our Senior Notes in the open market or in private transactions if such purchases can be made on economically favorable terms. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.
