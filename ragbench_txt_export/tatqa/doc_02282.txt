The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2020, and we are submitting that appointment to our shareholders for ratification on an
advisory basis at the meeting. Although shareholder ratification of KPMG’s appointment is not legally required,
we are submitting this matter to the shareholders, as in the past, as a matter of good corporate practice. In
determining whether to reappoint KPMG as our independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered a number
of factors, including, among others, the firm’s qualifications, industry expertise, prior performance, control
procedures, proposed staffing and the reasonableness of its fees on an absolute basis and as compared with
fees paid by comparable companies.
