It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our equity investments primarily because of their illiquidity and restricted marketability as of December 31, 2019. The factors we considered in trying to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer’s ability to meet its current obligations and the issuer’s subsequent or planned raises of capital.
