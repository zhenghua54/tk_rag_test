Goodwill acquired during fiscal 2018 totaled $97,597, with $91,098 of that resulting from the purchase of Ensenta Corporation, included in the Payments segment. The remaining $6,499 of goodwill acquired during fiscal 2018 resulted from the purchase of Vanguard Software Group, which was added to the Company’s Complementary segment. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions consists largely of the growth potential, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with those of Ensenta and Vanguard, together with the value of their assembled workforces. No goodwill was assigned to the Company’s Corporate and Other reportable segment.
