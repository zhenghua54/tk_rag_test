Although the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months an immaterial reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited and the outcome of tax examinations could also result in a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits. Other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.
