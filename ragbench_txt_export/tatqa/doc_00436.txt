Cost of revenues in 2019 decreased by $4.3 million, or 16%, as compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $2.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2018. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.5 million in 2019. We also experienced a decrease of $0.9 million in hosting costs in 2019, due to a decline in the usage of our hosted platform as compared to 2018. Additionally, depreciation decreased $0.5 million in 2019, due to the nature and timing of capital expenditures and internal projects as compared to 2018.
