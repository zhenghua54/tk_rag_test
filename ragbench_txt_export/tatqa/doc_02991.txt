ICS evaluates gross versus net revenue recognition for each of its contractual arrangements by assessing indicators of control and significant influence to determine whether the ICS acts as a principal (i.e. gross recognition) or an agent (i.e. net recognition). ICS has determined that it acts as a principal for all of its performance obligations in connection with all revenue earned. Net revenue represents gross revenue, net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, service credits and service adjustments. Cost of revenue includes network costs that consist of access, transport and termination costs. The majority of ICSâ€™s cost of revenue is variable, primarily based upon minutes of use, with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense.
