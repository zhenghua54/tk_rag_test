Having completed the 2019 impairment review, no impairment has been recognised in relation to the CGUs (2018: no impairment). Sensitivity
analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill. There are no changes to the key assumptions of growth rate or
discount rate that are considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, which give rise to an impairment of goodwill relating to the CGUs.
