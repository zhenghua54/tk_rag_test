TORM has leases for the office buildings, some vehicles and other administrative equipment. With the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability. The right-of-use assets are included in the financial statement line item in which the corresponding underlying assets would be presented if they were owned. Please refer to note 6.
