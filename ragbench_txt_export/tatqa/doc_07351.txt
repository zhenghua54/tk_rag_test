During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition, we granted 2.0 million cash-settled share unit awards at a grant date fair value of $36.37 per share unit to Pinnacle employees in replacement of their unvested restricted share unit awards that were outstanding as of the closing date. Included in the compensation expense described above for fiscal 2019 is expense of $18.9 million for accelerated vesting of awards related to Pinnacle integration restructuring activities, net of the impact of marking-to-market these awards based on a lower market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock. Approximately $36.3 million of the fair value of the replacement share unit awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. Included in the expense for cash-settled share unit awards above is income of $6.7 million related to the mark-to-market of this liability. As of May 26, 2019, our liability for the replacement awards was $15.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since completing the Pinnacle acquisition. Post-combination expense of approximately $3.9 million, based on the market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock as of May 26, 2019, is expected to be recognized related to the replacement awards over the remaining post-combination service period of approximately two years.
