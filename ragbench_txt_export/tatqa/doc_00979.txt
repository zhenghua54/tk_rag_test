Stock based compensation decreased by approximately $260,000 from $2.5 million in 2018 to $2.3 million in 2019 primarily because performance-based awards granted in 2018 vested, whereas performance-based awards granted in 2019 did not vest because we did not meet the stretch goals required for vesting.
