In fiscal year 2018, our Telecom market revenue decreased by $117.1 million, or 34.4%, compared to fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales of carrier-based optical semiconductor products to our Asia customer base, lower sales of products targeting fiber to the home applications and the May 2018 sale of our LR4 business.
