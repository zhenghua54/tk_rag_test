Broadcast station revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television airtime in return for a fixed fee or a portion of the related ad sales recognized by the third party. In a typical broadcast station revenue agreement, the licensee of a station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its station to a party which supplies content to be broadcast during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content.
