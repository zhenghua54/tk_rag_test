An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to arbitration. In December 2019, $1.3 million of the $2.8 million was released from the escrow account pursuant to the agreement, with the final settlement of the remaining balance expected during the fourth quarter of 2020. The remaining minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the seller ranges from no payment to $1.5 million.
