The Company is exposed to credit loss to the extent the fair value represents an asset in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the foreign currency forward contracts, and cross currency and interest rate swap agreements; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by any of the counterparties. In order to minimize counterparty risk, the Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties that are rated A- or better by Standard & Poor’s or A3 or better by Moody’s at the time of the transaction. In addition, to the extent possible and practical, interest rate swaps are entered into with different counterparties to reduce concentration risk.
