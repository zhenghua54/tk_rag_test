Within the operating expenses, there were a variety of increases, the largest of which was in salaries, wages and benefits, as a result of additional staff added in 2018 and 2019, including related benefits. During 2019, we hired a chief commercial officer, a chief technology officer, five new salespeople, a human resources manager, as well as other administrative positions. We also added 14 employees as a result of our RMDY acquisition in October 2019. During 2018, we added to our staff in several key areas, including a head of data analytics, an additional VP of sales, and a controller. We also added 10 employees in late 2018 as a result of our CareSpeak acquisition. The full year impact of these 2018 hires also increased payroll expense in 2019. We expect our compensation expense to increase in 2020, but at a much lower rate than in 2019.
