We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. As described in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, beginning on October 1, 2017, we concluded that CMS became a separate operating segment. In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values as of October 1, 2017. We estimated the fair value of CGD and CMS at October 1, 2017 based upon market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies in addition to discounted cash flows models for CMS and for a combination of CGD and CMS based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios, influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of the discrete financial forecasts. For the October 1, 2017 valuations, future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 13% for our CMS reporting unit and 11% for the combination of our CGD and CMS reporting units.
