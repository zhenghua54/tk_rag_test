The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its otherwise recognizable US, UK, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Brazil deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2019. Management has determined, after evaluating all positive and negative historical and prospective evidence, that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. The net (decrease) increase to the valuation allowance of $(0.1) million, $(1.5) million, and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, was primarily due to additional net operating losses generated by the Company.
