Bell Media operating revenues increased by 3.4% in Q4 2019, compared to the same period last year, driven by increased subscriber revenues from the continued growth in Crave due to higher subscribers along with rate increases following the launch of our enhanced Crave service in November 2018 and also reflected the favourability from BDU contract renewals. Advertising revenues declined modestly in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, from lower conventional TV advertising revenues and ongoing market softness in radio, partially offset by continued growth in specialty TV and OOH advertising revenues.
