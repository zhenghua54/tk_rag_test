CNS segment revenue decreased$2.1 million in fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year2018, due primarily to the expected lower sales of integrated cabinets, which are heavily project-based and historically high in customer concentration. There was a significant decrease in fiscal year 2019 from two of our historically larger customers for integrated cabinets - one where we customized integrated cabinets for a neutral host operator providing wireless coverage in the New York City subway and the other, a rural broadband service provider.
