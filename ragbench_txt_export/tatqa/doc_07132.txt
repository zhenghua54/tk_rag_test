The Company utilized the proceeds from the issuances of the 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and 2015 Senior Convertible Debt to reduce amounts borrowed under its Credit Facility and to settle a portion of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt in privately negotiated transactions. In February 2017 and February 2015, the Company settled $431.3 million and $575.0 million, respectively, in aggregate principal of its 2007 Junior Convertible Debt. The February 2015 repurchase consisted solely of cash. In February 2017, the Company used cash of $431.3 million and an aggregate of 12.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock valued at $862.7 million for total consideration of $1.29 billion to repurchase $431.3 million of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt, of which $188.0 million was allocated to the liability component and $1.11 billion was allocated to the equity component. In addition, in February 2017, there was an inducement fee of $5.0 million which was recorded in the consolidated statements of income in loss on settlement of debt. The consideration transferred in February 2015 was $1.13 billion, of which $238.3 million was allocated to the liability component and $896.3 million was allocated to the equity component. In the case of both settlements of the 2007 Junior Convertible Debt, the consideration was allocated to the liability and equity components using the equivalent rate that reflected the borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt prior to the retirement. The transactions resulted in a loss on settlement of debt of approximately $43.9 million and $50.6 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2015, respectively, which represented, in each case, the difference between the fair value of the liability component at time of repurchase and the sum of the carrying values of the debt component and any unamortized debt issuance costs.
