ISM segment revenue decreased$2.1 million in fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decline in deployment (i.e., installation) services revenue. Deployment services revenue had been largely dependent on one domestic customer that continues to buy our ISM remotes and support services but that, subsequent to a price increase, no longer places orders with us for deployment services. Secondarily, the ISM revenue decrease was also attributable to lower sales of our Optima network management software. Due to the project-based nature of our ISM business, it is difficult to make a determination on future trends.
