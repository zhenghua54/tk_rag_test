People costs, which comprise all staff costs including third-party contractor costs, increased by 3% in the year to £56.4m (2018: £54.8m). The increase in people costs was driven primarily by underlying salary costs which increased due to strong competition for digital talent, however this has been partially offset by a reduction in average full-time equivalent employees (‘FTEs’) (including contractors) to 804 (2018: 824). The number of FTEs was particularly impacted in the fourth quarter by the transfer of 15 staff to Dealer Auction, our joint venture with Cox Automotive UK. Share-based payments, including applicable national insurance costs of £5.9m (2018: £3.7m), have been included within people costs. The year-on-year increase in the share-based payment charge was due to leavers under the Performance Share Plan in 2018 for which a credit was recognised in the prior year, and a change in the way senior management are remunerated. The Group now settles a greater proportion of the senior management incentive scheme in shares which increases the share-based payment charge with an offset realised within cash bonuses.
