Our audit committee has adopted a pre-approval policy for the engagement of our independent accountant to perform certain audit and non-audit services. Pursuant to this policy, which is designed to assure that such engagements do not impair the independence of our auditors, the audit committee pre-approves annually all audit services, audit related services, tax services and other services as described above, that may be performed by our independent accountants. All of the audit and non-audit services provided by our principal accountants have been pre-approved by our Audit Committee.
