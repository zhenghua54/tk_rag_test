Revenues from Online Advertising business increased by 18% year-on-year to RMB68,377 million. Social and others advertising revenues grew by 33% to RMB52,897 million. The increase mainly reflected higher advertising revenues derived from Weixin (primarily Weixin Moments and Mini Programs) as a result of its increased inventories and impressions, as well as contributions from our mobile advertising network due to increased traffic and video inventories. Media advertising revenues decreased by 15% to RMB15,480 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues from our media platforms including Tencent Video and Tencent News resulting from unpredictability in broadcast schedules and the challenging macro-environment, as well as the absence of the FIFA World Cup in year 2019.
