(1) In 2018, we recorded $3.5 million of tax expense related to foreign earnings which were not permanently reinvested prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. After enactment, certain foreign earnings are taxed at higher statutory rates than the U.S. which results in $2.1 million of incremental tax expense in 2019. In 2017, we provided for deferred taxes on all cumulative unremitted foreign earnings, as the earnings were no longer considered permanently reinvested resulting in a charge of $9.5 million.
