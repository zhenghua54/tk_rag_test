Vessel expenses remained stable at $134,618 in 2019 from $134,956 in 2018. Depreciation expense increased by $1,987 to $52,499 in 2019 from $50,512 in 2018. The increase was due to an increase in amortization of drydock costs and an increase in depreciation expense due to the Overseas Gulf Coast and Overseas Sun Coast, our two new vessels, which entered service at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019.
