Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. There have been further amendments, including practical expedients, with the issuance of ASU 2018-01 in January 2018, ASU 2018-11 in July 2018 and ASU 2018-20 in December 2018. The amended guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. Based on the effective date, this guidance will apply beginning October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or net income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately $2.3 to $2.9 million.
