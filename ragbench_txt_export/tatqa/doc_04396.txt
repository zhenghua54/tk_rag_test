We do not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to using a non-GAAP financial measure, including that other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, that it does not reflect our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and that it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital.
