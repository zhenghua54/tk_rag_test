Adjusted EBITA was on the prior-year level as positive effects from productivity improvements and higher revenue were offset by price declines, a less favorable project mix and higher expenses for integration costs and capacity adjustments including severance. Severance charges were € 32 million in fiscal 2019 and
€ 77 million in fiscal 2018. SGRE’s order backlog was € 26 billion at end of the fiscal year, of which € 9 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2020.
