The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors and allows for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), RSAs, restricted share units, performance awards, or other stock-based awards. Stock option exercise prices are fixed by the Committee but shall not be less than the fair market value of a common share on the date of the grant of the option, except in the case of substitute awards. Similarly, the grant price of an SAR may not be less than the fair market value of a common share on the date of the grant. The Committee will determine the expiration date of each stock option and SAR, but in no case shall the stock option or SAR be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of the grant. The 2019 Plan provides for 2,600,000 shares available for grant. As of December 27, 2019, there were 2,222,088 shares available for grant.
