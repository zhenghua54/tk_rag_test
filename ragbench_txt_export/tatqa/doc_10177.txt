For 2019, the Company recorded an expense for income taxes of $11.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of (3.8)%. The effective tax rate is different than the U.S. statutory federal tax rate primarily due to stock-based compensation expense following the decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit discussed below, the full valuation allowance on the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets, the mix of income/losses among the Companyâ€™s foreign jurisdictions, and pretax losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit will be recognized.
