Restricted Shares will vest two or three years after the date of their award and Additional Shares will vest four or five years after the date of award. Vesting is subject, under normal circumstances, to continued employment during the vesting or ‘restricted’ period. There are no further performance conditions applicable to either Restricted Shares or Additional Shares.
