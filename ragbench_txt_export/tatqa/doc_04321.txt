During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement which extended the term of the loan to March 2023 as well as obtained a reduction in the interest rate and other fees. The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.
