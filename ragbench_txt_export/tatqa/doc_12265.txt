The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted from initial tax expense from Tax Reform and the tax impacts from the ISecG divestiture that we had in 2017, but not in 2018. The reduction of the U.S. statutory rate, combined with the net impact of the enactment or repeal of specific tax law provisions through Tax Reform, drove the remaining decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018.
