Total assets increased $1,234.7 million as at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, principally due to a $485.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities mainly as a result of the public offering in September 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $688.0 million. Business acquisitions during the year, largely due to the acquisition of 6RS, further impacted total assets through an increase in goodwill of $273.8 million, a $141.2 million increase in intangible assets and a resulting decrease in cash due to the consideration paid. The remainder of the increase is due to: the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, further discussed in the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section below, which resulted in the addition of right-of-use assets totaling $134.8 million as at December 31, 2019; a $58.3 million increase in merchant cash advances and loans receivable; a $49.8 million increase in property and equipment, largely related to leaseholds for our offices; a $49.2 million increase in trade and other receivables largely due to an increase in indirect taxes receivable, unbilled revenue related to subscription fees for Plus merchants, transaction fees and shipping charges; and a $19.4 million increase in deferred tax assets. Total liabilities increased by $309.7 million, principally as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard, which resulted in $126.8 million of additional lease liabilities related to obtaining right-of-use assets. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $84.2 million, which was due to an increase in indirect taxes payable, payroll liabilities, and payment processing and interchange fees, partly offset by a decrease in foreign exchange forward contract liabilities. The increase was also due to income taxes payable of $69.4 million driven largely by the one-time capital gain recognized in the period. Deferred tax liabilities increased by $7.6 million, due to the acquisition of 6RS. The growth in sales of our subscription solutions offering, along with the acquisition of 6RS, resulted in an increase of deferred revenue of $21.6 million.
