The 2016 Facility provides that the consolidated total leverage ratio may be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.00 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquisition in December of 2016, we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017.
