Total Group adjusted operating costs were up $8.3 million or 3.1 per cent in 2019 compared to last year, broadly in line with inflation. The emphasis remained on effective resource allocation and careful cost management. The overall investment in product development was maintained, with continuing focus on high-growth, high-margin areas. Investment in the sales and marketing organisation was targeted on expanding our key account management programme to drive incremental business with our most valuable customers and developing routes to market for our new technologies to a broadening customer base. Administration costs in 2019 reflected an inflationary increase and higher corporate costs, primarily due to CEO transition.
