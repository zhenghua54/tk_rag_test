In September 2015, we invested £1,400,000 or approximately $2.2 million for a 49% minority ownership
interest in Smart Driver Club Limited (“Smart Driver Club”), a technology and insurance startup company located in
the United Kingdom. This investment has been accounted for under the equity method since we have significant
influence over the investee. As of February 28, 2019, we had made loans aggregating £5,700,000 or approximately
$7.6 million to Smart Driver Club bearing interest at an annual interest rate of 8%, with all principal and all unpaid
interest due in 2021. Our equity in the net loss of Smart Driver Club amounted to $1.8 million, $1.4 million and $1.3
million in fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of February 28, 2019, we determined
that this equity method investment was subject to other than temporary impairment. This decision was dictated by the
continuing operating losses and deteriorating liquidity position of Smart Driver Club. Accordingly, we recorded an
impairment charge of $5.0 million in the impairment loss and equity in net loss within our consolidated statement of
comprehensive income (loss). Smart Driver Club drew an additional £400,000 of debt on March 26, 2019 under a
fourth amendment to the original agreement dated March 14, 2019
