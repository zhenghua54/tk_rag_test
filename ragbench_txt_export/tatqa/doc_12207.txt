The decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted primarily from a decline in pre-tax earnings coupled with favorable benefits from the settlement of international tax audits and changes in estimate in tax expense recorded upon finalizing U.S. tax returns. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of stock based compensation related to shortfalls that occurred during the year as well as the impact of limitations on current and future deductions for certain executive officers under IRC section 162(m).
