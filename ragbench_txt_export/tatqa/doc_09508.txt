It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groupâ€™s lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps (referred to as allocated swaps) in order to establish certainty over cash flows. Such allocated swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. The Group also holds interest rate swaps that are not actively used as a hedge against borrowings (referred to as unallocated swaps).
