Equity in net losses of affiliates: Pursuant to the formation of OneLNG in July 2016, we equity account for our share of net losses in OneLNG. Given the difficulties in finalizing an attractive debt financing package along with other capital and resource priorities, in April 2018, Golar and Schlumberger decided to wind down OneLNG and work on FLNG projects as required on a case-by-case basis. As a result, activity levels have been substantially reduced for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the carrying value of the investment was written down to $nil.
