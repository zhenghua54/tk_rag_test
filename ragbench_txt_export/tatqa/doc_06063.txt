As part of an intercompany restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred certain intellectual property assets between wholly- owned legal entities in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. As the impact of the transfer was the result of an intra-entity transaction, the resulting gain on the transfer was eliminated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. The transferring entity recognized a gain on the transfer of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction. In accordance with ASU 2016-16, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and as further described in Note 1. “Significant Accounting Policies”, Nielsen recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $193 million.
