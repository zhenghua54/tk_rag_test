As a result of the above changes, as of December 31, 2019, we had eight operating segments, which are aggregated into two reportable segments. The Provider reportable segment includes the Hospitals and Health Systems, Ambulatory, CarePort, FollowMyHealthÂ®, EPSiTM, EIS-Classics and 2bPrecise strategic business units, each of which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, connectivity and coordinated care solutions, financial and practice management software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing, private cloud hosting, revenue cycle management, training and electronic claims administration services. The Veradigm reportable segment is comprised of the Veradigm business unit, which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment provides data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media. Its solutions, targeted at key healthcare stakeholders, help improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery.
