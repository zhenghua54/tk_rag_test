Revenue from the resale of ancillary products, primarily consisting of hardware, is customer and project driven and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year improved primarily due to lower recognition of amortization of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenues acquired in the EIS Business, Practice Fusion, Health Grid and NantHealth provider/patient engagement acquisitions.
