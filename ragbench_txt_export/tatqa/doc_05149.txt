Amounts due under the Loan Agreement are secured by our assets, including all personal property, inventory and bank accounts; however, intellectual property is not secured under the Loan Agreement. The inventory used to secure the amount due does not include demo or loaner equipment with an aggregate book value up to $1.0 million. The Loan Agreement requires us to observe a number of financial and operational covenants, including maintenance of a specified Liquidity Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement), protection and registration of intellectual property rights and customary negative covenants. If any event of default occurs SVB may declare due immediately all borrowings under the Credit Facility and foreclose on the collateral. Furthermore, an event of default under the Credit Facility would result in an increase in the interest rate on any amounts outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, there were no events of default on the Credit Facility.
