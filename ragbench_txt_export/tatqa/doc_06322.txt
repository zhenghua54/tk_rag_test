Semiconductor and IP Licensing segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $81.9 million as compared to $186.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $104.5 million. The decrease in revenue was due principally to revenue recorded in 2018 related to the Samsung settlement and license agreement executed in December 2018, partially offset by a one-time payment from a new license agreement signed in December 2019.
