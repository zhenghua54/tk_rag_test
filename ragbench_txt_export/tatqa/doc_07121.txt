On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The Tax Act significantly revised the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, providing full expensing for investments in new and used qualified property made after September 27, 2017, and implementing a territorial tax system. In connection with the transition to the new territorial tax system, a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries was imposed for fiscal 2018 (the “Transitional Repatriation Tax”), for which an election can be made to pay over eight years. In addition, the Tax Act included two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions and the Base- Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”) provisions, which became effective for the Company during fiscal 2019. The GILTI provisions generally result in inclusion of income earned by foreign subsidiaries in the U.S. taxable income.
