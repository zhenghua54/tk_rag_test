Our sales to independent electronic distributors represented 42.3% of total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared to 42.7% for fiscal year
ended March 31, 2018. Overall, distributor sales activity increased in dollars when compared to the same period last year due to a more favorable pricing environment
and increased order activity throughout the year in response to extended product delivery lead times. This increase in distributor activity is reflective of the increased
customer demand and steadily improving market conditions. Our sales to distributor customers involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs for which
sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales. As a result of the favorable pricing environment and high demand, such allowance charges decreased to $28.9
million, or 3.9% of gross sales to distributor customers, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to $30.5 million, or 4.6% of gross sales to distributor
customers, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. Applications under such programs for fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $24.4 million
and $29.4 million, respectively.
