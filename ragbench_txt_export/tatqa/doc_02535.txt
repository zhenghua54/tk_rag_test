In accordance with the terms of the plan, this decline in Compensation NAV directly reduces the deferred cash compensation awarded in 2017 and 2018. The total reduction recognized in 2019 was $0.8 million, related to the claw back of a portion of the 2017 and 2018 awards which were unpaid as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the plan requires that future NAV growth continues to be determined using the high water mark based on the beginning Compensation NAV established at the beginning of 2019.
