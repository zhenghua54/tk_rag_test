In May 2017, we adopted the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2017 ESPP”). The 2017 ESPP grants employees the ability to designate a portion of their base-pay to purchase ordinary shares at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the first or last day of each 6 month purchase period. Purchase periods begin on January 1 or July 1 and end on June 30 or December 31, or the next business day if such date is not a business day. Shares are purchased on the last day of the purchase period.
