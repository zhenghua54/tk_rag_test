In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant awards of restricted stock units and cash-settled restricted stock units ("share units") to employees and directors. These awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each such award, stock or cash (as applicable) is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the "vesting period"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments.
