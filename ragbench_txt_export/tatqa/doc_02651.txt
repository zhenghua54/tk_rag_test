During Fiscal 2019, we began to implement restructuring activities to streamline our operations (Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan), including in connection with our recent acquisitions of Catalyst and Liaison, to take further steps to improve our operational efficiency. The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan charges relate to workforce reductions and facility consolidations. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate.
