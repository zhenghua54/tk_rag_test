We are exposed to foreign exchange movements on our overseas investments. At 31 December 2019 the exposure was 24 per cent of net assets attributable to shareholders, the increase from the 31 December 2018 exposure of 15 per cent being due to the property revaluation deficit in the UK. Adjusted for the disposals in intu Puerto Venecia and intu Asturias, this exposure would be reduced to 15 per cent.
