In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 to provide guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB 118 allowed for a provisional estimate of the impacts of the TCJA in our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as up to a one year measurement period that ended on December 22, 2018, for any subsequent adjustments to such provisional estimate. In 2018, Verizon completed its analysis of the impacts of the TCJA, including analyzing the effects of any IRS and U.S. Treasury guidance issued, and state tax law changes enacted, within the one year measurement period resulting in no significant adjustments to the $16.8 billion provisional amount recorded in December 2017.
