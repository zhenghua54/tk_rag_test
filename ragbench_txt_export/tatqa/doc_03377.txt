NEXTDC Limited acquired Asia Pacific Data Centre (“APDC”) on 18 October 2018 (refer to note 26). Following acquisition, the entities comprising APDC were subsequently wound up, and the underlying properties were transferred to a new entity established by NEXTDC - NEXTDC Holdings Trust No. 1 (refer to note 27). This resulted in the above loss in the parent entity on derecognition of its investment in APDC, while a corresponding gain was recorded in NEXTDC Holdings Trust No. 1 on transfer of the properties.
