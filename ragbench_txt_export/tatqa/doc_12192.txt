We grow and maintain flocks of layers (mature female chickens), pullets (female chickens, under 18 weeks of age), and breeders (male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to hatch for egg production flocks). Our total flock at June 1, 2019, consisted of approximately 9.4 million pullets and breeders and 36.2 million layers.
