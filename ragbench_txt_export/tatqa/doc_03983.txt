In connection with the IPO, we also entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of the Partnership to lease back one of our originally contributed projects, Maryland Solar, until December 31, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, we made fixed rent payments to the Partnershipâ€™s subsidiary and were entitled to all of the energy generated by the project. Due to certain continuing involvement with the project, we accounted for the leaseback agreement as a financing transaction until the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries in June 2018. Following the sale of such interests, the Maryland Solar project qualified for sale-leaseback accounting, and we recognized net revenue of $32.0 million from the sale of the project.
