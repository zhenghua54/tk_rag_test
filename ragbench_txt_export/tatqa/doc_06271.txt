Operating Income
Operating income in 2019 decreased $18.0 million to $115.9 million, compared to $133.9 million for 2018. Operating margins
were 18.8% for 2019 versus 23.9% for 2018. Operating income and margin decreased primarily due to our commitment to
strategically invest in a business transition to a cloud first company focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth and earnings
leverage. As a result, we are investing significantly in R&D to deliver new innovation, cloud operations headcount, infrastructure and
technology to support our ability to scale our cloud business to achieve our growth objectives. In addition, our innovation releases have fueled strong demand for our global consulting services and we are actively hiring to fulfill customer demand, which pressures operating income and margins until new resources ramp to full utilization. Finally, our performance-based compensation expense has increased over the prior year based on strong execution against target objectives. In 2019, operating income in the Americas segment decreased by $18.9 million and remained relatively flat in the EMEA and APAC segments.
Operating income in 2018 decreased $51.7 million to $133.9 million, compared to $185.6 million for 2017. Operating margins were 23.9% for 2018 versus 31.2% for 2017. Operating income and margin decreased primarily as a result of our investment in cloud transition combined with lower license revenue. The operating income decrease in the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments was
$39.1 million, $9.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
