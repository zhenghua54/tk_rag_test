The European Commission has concluded its investigation into the UK’s controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules. The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal. No provision for this potential liability of $3.6M has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not clear what, if any, the ultimate financial result will be.
