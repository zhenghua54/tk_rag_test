Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities on earnings per share. We have stock options, stock-settled appreciation rights ("SSARs"), unvested restricted shares and unvested performance shares that are potentially dilutive securities. When a loss is reported, the denominator of diluted earnings per share cannot be adjusted for the dilutive impact of sharebased compensation awards because doing so would be anti-dilutive.
