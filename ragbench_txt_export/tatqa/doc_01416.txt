We are under audit by the IRS for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions within the U.S., and certain jurisdictions are under audit by state and local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Tax periods for all years beginning with fiscal year 2013 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
