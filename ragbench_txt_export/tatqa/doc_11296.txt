Revenue from ASG decreased by $98.9 million, or approximately 5%, which was also due to a combination of a decrease in volume of products sold and a competitive pricing environment. The revenue in our Industrial and Offline Power Division and our Signal Processing, Wireless and Medical Division, decreased by $100.5 million and $56.4 million, respectively. This was partially offset by $84.8 million of revenue from Quantenna, which was acquired during 2019.
