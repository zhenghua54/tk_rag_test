Net Pool Allocation: Net pool allocation increased by $10.5 million, from $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net pool allocation was attributable to the movement in the adjustment of the net pool results earned by the GasLog vessels in accordance with the pool distribution formula. GasLog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of $102.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively, from the operation of its vessels in the Cool Pool during the year ended December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: $38.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively). The increase in GasLog’s total net pool performance was driven by higher spot rates and higher utilization achieved by all vessels trading in the Cool Pool.
