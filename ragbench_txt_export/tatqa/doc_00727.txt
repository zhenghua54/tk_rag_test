We continue to focus efforts to enhance reimbursement from plans when profiles are ordered and there is no payer contract in place. We are actively engaging plans with detail which supports a physicianâ€™s reason for ordering. Our utilization of pre-authorizations and supporting documentation assists in the overall billing and appeal process, optimizing payment with payers, who do not have a formal agreement with us.
