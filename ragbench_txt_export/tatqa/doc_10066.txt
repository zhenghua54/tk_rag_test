Interest income: Interest income increased by $4.2 million to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2017 due to returns on our fixed deposits that had been made in 2018, and income derived from the lending capital of our lessor VIEs, that we are required to consolidate under U.S. GAAP.
