As part of the Companyâ€™s previous acquisition of FPSO units from Petrojarl ASA (subsequently renamed Teekay Petrojarl AS, or Teekay Petrojarl), the Company assumed a certain FPSO contract with terms that were less favorable than the then prevailing market terms. At the time of the acquisition, the Company recognized a liability based on the estimated fair value of this contract and service obligation.
