Restricted shares and restricted share units have the right to receive dividends, or dividend equivalents in the case of restricted share units, if any, upon vesting, subject to the same forfeiture provisions that apply to the underlying awards. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 2016 Plan, for awards to employees, no performance-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall be based on a restriction period of less than one year, and any time-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall have a minimum restriction period of three years.
