In May 2003, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. As of April 26, 2019, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $13.6 billion of our common stock, including a $4.0 billion increase approved by our Board of Directors in April 2018. Since inception of the program through April 26, 2019, we repurchased a total of 313 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $11.7 billion. Under this program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in such other manner as deemed appropriate by our management. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
