The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the Directors’ most recent financial forecasts for the following five years. The growth rates for the five-year period are based on Directors’ expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the cash-generating unit, planned growth in market share, industry forecasts, growth in the market and specific regional considerations and are in line with past experience. Discount rates have been estimated based on rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
