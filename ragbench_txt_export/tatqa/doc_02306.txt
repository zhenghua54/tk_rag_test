The unrecognized tax benefits of $13.0 million, if recognized, will impact the Companyâ€™s effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. We had $3.0 million and $1.2 million of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will decrease by approximately $3.5 million in 2020 based on statute of limitation expiration.
