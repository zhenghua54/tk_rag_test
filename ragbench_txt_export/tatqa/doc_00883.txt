Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, decreased inventories and non-cash expenses, partially offset by increased contract assets and accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of collections on accounts receivable sold under the securitization programs and the timing of purchases and cash payments. The decrease in inventories is primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the reclassification to contract assets for revenue recognized for over time customers, partially offset by an increase in inventories to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The increase in contract assets is due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the amended and new securitization programs and higher sales and timing of collections.
