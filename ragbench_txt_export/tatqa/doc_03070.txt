The Company leased its manufacturing and office space from Reckson under an initial 11-year lease followed by two five-year renewal periods which ended in January 2019. On July 25, 2018, the Company signed an amendment to the lease with RA 55 CLB LLC (as successor-in-interest to Reckson) which extended the current lease terms ten years and eight months through September 30, 2029. Pursuant to the amendment to the lease agreement, the Company shall pay a gradually increasing annual rent of $1,046,810 in 2019 to $1,276,056 in 2029. The Company believes the leased space is adequate to meet the Company’s domestic operational needs which encompass the principal operations of the FEI-NY segment and also serves as the Company’s world-wide corporate headquarters.
