Gross profit percentage. Gross profit percentage is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross profit percentage has been relatively consistent over the past three years; however, it has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to timing of the addition of hardware and employees to serve our growing customer base. More recently, gross profit has also included amortization of intangible assets related to acquired businesses.
