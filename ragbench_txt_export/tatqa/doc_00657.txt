Interest expense decreased $54.7 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to elimination of the non-recourse residential financing obligations in connection with the sale of the Residential Lease Portfolio in November 2018, as well as the elimination of the sales-leaseback financing obligations in connection with the sale of the commercial sale-leaseback portfolio during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019.
