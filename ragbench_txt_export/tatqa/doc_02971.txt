The sale closed on May 31, 2018. In accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Purchaser agreed to pay us $135.0 million in cash upon the closing of the transaction, adjusted for the estimated working capital of CGD Services at the date of the sale compared to a working capital target. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we received $133.8 million in connection with the sale and we recorded a receivable from the Purchaser for the estimated amount due related to the working capital settlement. The balance of this receivable was $3.7 million at September 30, 2018. During fiscal 2019, we worked with the Purchaser and revised certain estimates related to the working capital settlement. In connection with the revision of these estimates, we reduced the receivable from the Purchaser by $1.4 million and recognized a corresponding loss on the sale of CGD Services in fiscal 2019. Certain remaining working capital settlement estimates, primarily related to the fair value of accounts receivable, have not yet been settled with the Purchaser.
