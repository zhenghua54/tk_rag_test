In September 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings located in Sunnyvale, California, with a book value of $118 million, for a total of $306 million, through two separate and independent closings. Upon the completion of the first closing in fiscal 2018, we consummated the sale of properties with a net book value of $66 million for cash proceeds of $210 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $142 million. The remaining properties, consisting of land with a net book value of $52 million, were classified as assets held-for-sale, and included as other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of April 26, 2019 and April 27, 2018. We will consummate the sale of these properties, and receive cash proceeds of $96 million, upon the completion of the second closing, which is expected to occur within the next 12 months. That closing is subject to due diligence, certain termination rights and customary closing conditions, including local governmental approval of the subdivision of a land parcel.
