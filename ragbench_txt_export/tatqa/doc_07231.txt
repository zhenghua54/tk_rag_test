The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees, and all other fees as described above is compatible with maintaining
Marcum LLP’s and Malone Bailey LLP’s independence and has determined that such services for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, were compatible. All such services
were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act to the extent that rule was applicable.
