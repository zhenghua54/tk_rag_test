Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to revenue declines in our education services and, to a lesser extent, our consulting services. During fiscal 2019, constant currency increases in our EMEA-based services revenues were offset by constant currency services revenue decreases in the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions.
