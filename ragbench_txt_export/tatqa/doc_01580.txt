Generally, we assess if it is more-likely-than-not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized during the available carry-forward periods. As a result, we have determined that valuation allowances of $8,011 and $8,274 should be provided for certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowances relate to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. loss carry-forwards and certain U.S. state tax credits that management does not anticipate will be utilized.
