Revenues from Online Advertising increased by 19% to RMB20,225 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 on a year-onyear basis. Social and others advertising revenues increased by 37% to RMB16,274 million. The increase was mainly driven by advertising revenue growth from Weixin Moments and our mobile advertising network. Media advertising revenues decreased by 24% to RMB3,951 million. The decrease primarily reflected lower advertising revenues from our media platforms including Tencent Video and Tencent News due to uncertain broadcasting schedules and fewer telecasts of sports events.
