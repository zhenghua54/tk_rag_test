In addition, as at December 31, 2019, we held $1,831 million of
marketable securities in publicly traded companies (2018 – $1,051 million). Our adjusted net debt increased by $3,379 million from December 31, 2018 as a result of: • the inclusion of lease liabilities in the calculation, which had a balance of $1,725 million at year-end, as discussed above; and • a net increase in our outstanding long-term debt, in part due to the 600 MHz spectrum licences we acquired for $1,731 million this year; partially offset by • an increase in our net cash position.
