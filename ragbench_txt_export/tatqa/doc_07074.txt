On 24 June 2019, the Group reset the interest rates associated with AUD denominated interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. This resulted in a cash outflow of $22.9m which reduced the Groupâ€™s financial liability as presented in note 9.8. In accordance with AASB 9 Financial instruments, as the nature of the underlying hedged instrument is unchanged the fair value of this outflow remains in the cash flow hedge reserve and will be amortised to the statement of profit or loss in future periods.
