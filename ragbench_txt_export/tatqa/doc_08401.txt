The tax years 2016 to 2019 remain open for potential audit by the Internal Revenue Service. There are no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2019, and none are expected in the next 12 months. The Companyâ€™s foreign subsidiaries are cost centers that are reimbursed for expenses, so generate no income or loss. Pretax book income (loss) is all from domestic operations. Up to four years of returns remain open for potential audit in foreign jurisdictions, however any audits for periods prior to ownership by the Company are the responsibility of the previous owners.
