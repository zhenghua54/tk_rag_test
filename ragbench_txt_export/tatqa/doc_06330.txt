We provided our products to our largest end customer (Apple) through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 32% and 36% of total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Huawei accounted for approximately 13% and 8% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These customers primarily purchase RF and Wi-Fi solutions for cellular base stations and a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT. In May 2019, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on the sales of products to Huawei (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report).
