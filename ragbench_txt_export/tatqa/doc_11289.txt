Our Technology Development segment revenues increased $5.1 million to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues within this segment increased due to additional contract awards, including higher value Phase 2 SBIR contracts. The increase continues a growth trend experienced over the past two years largely driven by successes in Phase 2 SBIR awards. The increase was realized primarily in our intelligent systems, advanced materials, optical systems and terahertz research groups. As Phase 2 SBIR contracts generally have a performance period of a year or more, we currently expect Technology Development segment revenues to remain at a similar level for the near term.
