The mobile market remains competitive and we continue to see pressure on pricing. While overall growth in the broadband market is limited, we are seeing good demand for our premium products such as fibre and 4G Assure. Newer areas such as the Internet of Things, Cloud, SDWAN and security remain good opportunities for us over the longer term.
