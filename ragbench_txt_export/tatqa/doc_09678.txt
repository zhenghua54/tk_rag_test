REVENUE Fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 22.4% (17.9% in constant currency). In local currency, revenue amounted to US$782.3 million compared to US$662.3 million for fiscal 2018. The increase resulted mainly from: • the impact of the MetroCast acquisition completed on January 4, 2018 which was included in revenue for only an eight-month period in the prior year; • rate increases; • continued growth in Internet service customers; and • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; partly offset by • a decrease in video service customers. Excluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions, revenue in constant currency increased by 5.2% for fiscal 2019.
