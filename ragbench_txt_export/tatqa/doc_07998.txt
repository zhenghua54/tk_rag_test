The Tax Act was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act included a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate (the “Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% and introduced new limitations on certain business deductions. As a result, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we recognized a year-to-date, non-cash $32.5 million tax provision expense impact primarily related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduced Tax Rate.
