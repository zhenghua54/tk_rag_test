The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P), the tax on which the Company previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax expense for each of its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a transition tax expense of $644.7 million at March 31, 2018. Upon further analyses of the Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, the Company finalized its calculations of the transition tax expense during the period ended December 31, 2018. The Company increased its March 31, 2018 provisional amount by $13.1 million to $657.8 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. The measurement period adjustment of $13.1 million decreased basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.06 and $0.05, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2019.
