Total gross wireless activations increased by 8.3% in 2019, compared to last year, due to higher prepaid gross activations, offset in part by lower postpaid gross activations. • Postpaid gross activations decreased by 2.9% in 2019, compared to 2018, mainly due to fewer year-over-year customer additions from our contract with SSC as the migration process is essentially complete. Excluding the impact of the SSC contract, postpaid gross activations were higher year over year, driven by our mobile network quality, strong sales execution and focus on subscriber base management. • Prepaid gross activations increased by 61.9% in 2019, compared to last year, driven by the continued growth from Lucky Mobile along with the benefit from the national retail distribution of Lucky Mobile and Virgin Mobile prepaid services at Dollarama stores
