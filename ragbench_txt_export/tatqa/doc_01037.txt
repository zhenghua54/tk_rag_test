If the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 were recognized, our income tax provision would decrease by $343.5 million, resulting in a substantially lower effective tax rate. Based on the potential outcome of the Companyâ€™s global tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is possible that the unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly within the next 12 months. Absent resolution of significant tax controversy, the associated impact on the reserve balance is estimated to be a decrease in the range of $4.6 to $6.6 million during 2020.
