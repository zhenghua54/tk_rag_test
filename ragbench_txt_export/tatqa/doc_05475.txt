The Company contributes an amount equivalent to 2% of the employees’ total salaries and wages on a monthly basis to the pension fund deposited with the Bank of Taiwan under the name of a pension fund supervisory committee. The pension fund is managed by the government’s designated authorities and therefore is not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, total pension expenses of NT$80 million, NT$69 million and NT$59 million, respectively, were recognized by the Company.
