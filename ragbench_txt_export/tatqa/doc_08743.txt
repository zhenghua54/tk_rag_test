Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue decreased 1.1 percent as reported but was essentially flat adjusted for currency, reflecting the mainframe product cycles. Revenue declined through the first three quarters due to the end of the z14 product cycle, but there was strong growth in the fourth quarter driven by z15 shipments. The z15â€™s strong performance demonstrates client demand for technology that offers improved data privacy and resiliency in the hybrid cloud environment.
