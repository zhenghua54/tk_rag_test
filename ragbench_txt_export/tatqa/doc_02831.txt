In consideration for serving as the sole member of our Strategic Development Committee, in June 2013 we issued to Niv Harizman a five-year stock option to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $1.88 per share, which option vested 100,000 shares on the date of grant, 100,000 shares on the first anniversary of the date of grant and vested 100,000 shares on the second anniversary from the grant date. On June 17, 2018, Mr. Harizman exercised the aforementioned stock option on a net (cashless) exercise basis by delivering to us 181,936 shares of our common stock and he received 118,064 shares of our common stock.
