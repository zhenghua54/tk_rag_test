In the interest of the shareholders, the Company sends periodical reminders to the shareholders to claim
their dividends in order to avoid transfer of dividends/shares to IEPF Authority. Notices in this regard are also
published in the newspapers and the details of unclaimed dividends and shareholders whose shares are liable
to be transferred to the IEPF Authority, are uploaded on the Companyâ€™s website (https://www.tcs.com/detailsunclaimed-
