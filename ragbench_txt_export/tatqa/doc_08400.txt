The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Companyâ€™s ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods in which the net operating losses expire and the temporary differences become deductible. The Company has determined that there is significant uncertainty that the results of future operations and the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets; therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded. In making this determination, the Company considered historical levels of income as well as projections for future periods.
