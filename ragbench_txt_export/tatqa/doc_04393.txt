(8) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net (loss) income, adjusted to exclude: depreciation, amortization, disposals and impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition-related gains and expenses, litigation-related expenses, share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange income (expense). Adjusted EBITDA also includes rent paid in the period related to locations that are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities.
