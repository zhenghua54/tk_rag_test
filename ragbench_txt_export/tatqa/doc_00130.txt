We employ a liability-driven investment strategy whereby a mix of equity and fixed-income investments are used to pursue a derisking strategy which over time seeks to reduce interest rate mismatch risk and other risks while achieving a return that matches or exceeds the growth in projected pension plan liabilities. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities and funded status. The investment portfolio primarily contains a diversified mix of equity and fixed-income investments. Other assets such as private equity are used modestly to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and asset/liability studies at regular intervals.
