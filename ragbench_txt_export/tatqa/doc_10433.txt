Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $33.7 million, from $283.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $317.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to an increase of $57.7 million caused by movements in working capital accounts due primarily to (a) increased cash from related parties of $56.3 million (mainly collection of Cool Pool receivables), (b) an increase of $20.3 million from movements in other payables and accruals, and (c) an increase of $4.6 million from movements in trade and other receivables, partially offset by an increase in cash collateral on swaps of $22.2 million, an increase of $28.2 million in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation), partially offset by a decrease of $29.9 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $22.3 million from the remaining movements.
