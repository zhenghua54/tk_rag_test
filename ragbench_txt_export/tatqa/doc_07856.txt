Refrigerated & Frozen net sales for fiscal 2018 were $2.75 billion, an increase of $100.3 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal 2017. Results for fiscal 2018 reflected a 3% increase in volume compared to fiscal 2017, excluding the impact of 31 acquisitions. The increase in sales volumes was a result of brand renovation and innovation launches. Price/mix was flat compared to fiscal 2017, as favorability in both net pricing and mix offset continued investment in retailer marketing to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution, and consumer trial. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of Wisconsin® business contributed $21.3 million to Refrigerated & Frozen's net sales during fiscal 2018. The Frontera acquisition, which occurred in September 2016, and subsequent innovation in the Frontera® brand contributed $4.4 million during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.
