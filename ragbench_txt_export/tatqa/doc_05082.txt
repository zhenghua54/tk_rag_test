We recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize, as a component of other comprehensive earnings, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit/cost.
