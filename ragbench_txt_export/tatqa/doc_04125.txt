The Company accrued $2.7 million as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, excluding penalties and interest, for the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was included in “Long-term income tax liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Had the Company recognized these tax benefits, approximately $2.7 million, along with the related interest and penalties, would have favorably impacted the effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018. The Company does not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months.
