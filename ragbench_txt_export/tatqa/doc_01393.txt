GreenSky, Inc. is taxed as a corporation and pays corporate federal, state and local taxes on income allocated to it from GS Holdings based upon GreenSky, Inc.â€™s economic interest held in GS Holdings. GS Holdings is treated as a pass-through partnership for income tax reporting purposes and not subject to federal income tax. Accordingly, the Company is not liable for income taxes on the portion of GS Holdings' earnings not allocated to it. The results for the year ended December 31, 2017 do not reflect income tax expense because, prior to the Reorganization Transactions, the consolidated GSLLC (and subsequently GS Holdings) pass-through entity was not subject to corporate tax.
