For equity awards granted under the VMware equity plan, volatility was based on an analysis of historical stock prices and implied volatilities of VMware’s Class A common stock. The expected term was based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the term of the option period for grants made under the ESPP, or the weighted-average remaining term for options assumed in acquisitions. VMware’s expected dividend yield input was zero as the Company has not historically paid, nor expects in the future to pay, regular dividends on its common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options.
