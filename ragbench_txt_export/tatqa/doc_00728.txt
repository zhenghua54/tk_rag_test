In parallel with the private payer activities described above, we are also making extensive efforts to explore approval pathways for our test capabilities (including the FDA in-vitro medical device clearance we received in November 2019), which we believe will facilitate coverage from governmental programs such as Medicare. Those activities are ongoing but have uncertainty on the timelines as to formal approval. Lastly, we have implemented an increase in the patient financial responsibility which is collected prior to testing to ensure that at least a partial payment is received for every test performed, we expect unpaid and partial paid orders to decline, which will likely result in a decline in total GPS orders and revenue in the short-term.
