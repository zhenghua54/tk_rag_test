The Committee has approved Fixed Pay increases of 4% for the CEO and 3% for the CFO, effective from 1 January 2020. This is in line with the average increase awarded to the wider Unilever workforce in 2019 of 3.6%. These increases were awarded to recognise the strong leadership of both individuals in 2019, which was Alan Jope’s first year in the CEO role and a year of transformation for Unilever generally. We also wanted to recognise Graeme Pitkethly’s seniority in his role, coming into his 5th year as CFO.
