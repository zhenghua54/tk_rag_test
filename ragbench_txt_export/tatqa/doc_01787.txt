The increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by a $111.8 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions. The $111.8 million increase consisted of a $72.8 million increase in Ceramic product line sales and a $39.0 million increase in Tantalum product line sales. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was a $30.6 million increase in OEM sales across the APAC, EMEA, and JPKO regions, and a $28.0 million increase in EMS sales across all regions. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in distributor sales in the JPKO region and a $2.7 million decrease in OEM sales in the Americas region. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was unfavorably impacted by $0.5 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.
