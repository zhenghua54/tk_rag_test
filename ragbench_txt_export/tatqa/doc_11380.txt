Our funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which we operate as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time to time. We expect to make the minimum required contributions of $42 million and $26 million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2020. We may also make voluntary contributions at our discretion.
