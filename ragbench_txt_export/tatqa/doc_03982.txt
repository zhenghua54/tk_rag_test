In June 2018, we completed the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries to CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV, LLC, an equity fund managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc. and certain other co-investors and other parties, and received net proceeds of $240.0 million after the payment of fees, expenses, and other amounts. We accounted for our interests in OpCo, a subsidiary of the Partnership, under the equity method of accounting as we were able to exercise significant influence over the Partnership due to our representation on the board of directors of its general partner and certain of our associates serving as officers of its general partner. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized equity in earnings, net of tax, of $39.7 million from our investment in OpCo, including a gain of $40.3 million, net of tax, for the sale of our interests in the Partnership and its subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received distributions from OpCo of $12.4 million.
