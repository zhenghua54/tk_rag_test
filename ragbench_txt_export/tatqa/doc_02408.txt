Bell Wireless operating revenues increased by 3.6% in Q4Â 2019, compared to Q4 2018, driven by higher service and product revenues. Service revenues grew by 1.6% year over year due to continued growth in both our postpaid and prepaid subscriber base along with rate increases and a greater mix of customers subscribing to higher-value monthly plans including unlimited data plans. This was moderated by greater sales of premium handsets along with the impact of higher value monthly plans, and lower data overage driven by increased customer adoption of unlimited data plans. Product revenues grew by 7.4% year over year, driven by increased sales of premium handsets and the impact of higher-value monthly plans in our sales mix.
