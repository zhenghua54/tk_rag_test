To complement our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows, we use non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted gross margin, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EBITDA are complements to U.S. GAAP amounts and such measures are useful to investors. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.
