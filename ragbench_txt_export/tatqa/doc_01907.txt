The increase in Solid Capacitors net sales was primarily driven by the addition of net sales of $133.8 million resulting from the TOKIN acquisition and an increase in net sales to the legacy products distributor channel of $81.7 million. To a lesser degree, an increase in legacy Ceramic products' net sales of $6.0 million in the EMS channel across all regions and $10.2 million in the OEM channel in the EMEA and APAC regions also contributed to the increase in Solid Capacitors net sales. These increases were partially offset by a $28.0 million decrease in net sales in the OEM channel for legacy Tantalum products across all regions. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was favorably impacted by $6.1 million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.
