(4) On August 4, 2017, the Equity Award Committee approved a change in the vesting condition regarding the existing long-term share-based compensation programs transferring to Diversey as part of the sale of Diversey. The approved change resulted in a pro-rata share of vesting calculated on the close date of the sale of Diversey. In December 2018, the Equity Award Committee approved a change in the vesting condition for certain individuals who would be leaving the Company under a phase of our Reinvent SEE Restructuring program. For both modifications, we recorded the cumulative expense of the higher fair value of the impacted awards at modification approval.
