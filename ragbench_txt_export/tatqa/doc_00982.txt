For fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities of $4.42 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services and Digital Experience hosted services. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses with certain vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and increase in long-term contract assets.
