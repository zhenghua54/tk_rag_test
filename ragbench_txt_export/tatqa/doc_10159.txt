On June 4, 2019, we entered into four separate accelerated share repurchase agreements (collectively, the “June 2019 ASR”) with two financial institutions to repurchase a total of $750 million of Common Stock. We took an initial delivery of approximately 3.1 million shares, which represented 75% of the prepayment amount divided by our closing stock price on June 4, 2019. The total number of shares received under the June 2019 ASR will be based upon the average daily volume weighted average price of our Common Stock during the repurchase period, less an agreed upon discount. Final settlement of the June 2019 ASR is anticipated to occur no later than November 20, 2019.
