During Fiscal 2018 and in the context of our acquisitions of Covisint, Guidance and Hightail (each defined below), we began to implement restructuring activities to streamline our operations (collectively referred to as the Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan). The Fiscal 2018 Restructuring Plan charges relate to workforce reductions and facility consolidations. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate.
