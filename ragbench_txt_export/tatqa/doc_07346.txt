Selling, general and administrative expenses presented in the table above include corporate costs directly in support of Qdoba operations. All other corporate costs were classified in results of continuing operations. Our credit facility required us to make a mandatory prepayment (“Qdoba Prepayment”) on our term loan upon the closing of the Qdoba Sale, which was $260.0 million. Interest expense associated with our credit facility was allocated to discontinued operations based on our estimate of the mandatory prepayment that was made upon closing of the Qdoba Sale.
