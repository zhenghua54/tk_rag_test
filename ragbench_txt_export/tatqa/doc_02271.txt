The Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.
