During the reporting period, the group tax rate for the continuing segment is 42.0% (2017/18: 37.6%). The group tax rate represents the relationship between recognised income tax expenses and earnings before taxes. The increase in the ratio in the current financial year is mainly attributable to impairments on deferred taxes on loss carry-forwards in Germany. The comparatively low ratio in the previous year includes positive one-off tax effects such as tax rate changes abroad and the reduction for risk provisions.
