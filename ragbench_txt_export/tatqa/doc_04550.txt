Subscription revenues increased $223.3 million, or 54%, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in subscription revenues was primarily attributable to additional subscriptions from our existing customer base. As customers increasingly adopt cloud-based, subscription services and term-based licenses of our Data Center products for their business needs, we expect our subscription revenues to continue to increase at a rate higher than the rate of increase of our perpetual license revenues in future periods.
