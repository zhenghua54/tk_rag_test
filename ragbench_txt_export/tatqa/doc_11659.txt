APACâ€™s gross profit in 2019 increased 1% (increased 6% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), compared to 2018, with gross margin increasing to 22.1% in 2019 from 21.2% in 2018. The improvement in gross margin for both EMEA and APAC in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to changes in sales mix to higher margin products and services.
