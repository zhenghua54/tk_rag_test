Net cash used in financing activities was $10.4 million for fiscal 2018 . During fiscal 2018, we entered into a new ABL which effectively doubled our borrowing capacity. We drew $47.1 million from the ABL to make an equivalent prepayment on our term loan which lowered the effective interest rates charged on our outstanding indebtedness. We also made additional principal payments of $5.2 million on our indebtedness, paid a $3.0 million earn-out related to our Fells Point acquisition, and made a $1.5 million payment for financing fees related to our new ABL.
