Cash flow from operating activities remained strong at $142.9 million, reduced by $4.8 million from $147.7 million in the prior-year. The small overall decrease was due to an increase in overheads, partially offset by a reduction in the cashflow outflow on exceptional items and an improved use of working capital. Unlevered free cashflow decreased by $15.8 million to $123.8 million representing the reduction in net cash flow from operating activities adjusted for the cashflow impact of exceptional items.
