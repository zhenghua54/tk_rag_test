The decline in basic earnings per share reflects the decrease of Net income attributable to Shareholders of Siemens AG, which was € 5,174 million in fiscal 2019 compared to € 5,807 million in fiscal 2018, partially offset by a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding. Basic earnings per share excluding severance charges was € 6.93.
