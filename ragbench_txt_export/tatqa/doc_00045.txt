The 1,666,667 shares issued at closing of our purchase of Golden Ridge included 380,952 shares that were deposited in an escrow account to be used to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the seller that may arise. As of December 31, 2018, the 380,952 shares remained in escrow. In July 2019, we reached an agreement to settle the $0.6 million working capital adjustment receivable and other claims with the sellers of Golden Ridge. As a result, (i) 340,000 shares of common stock held in the escrow account ($1.0 million fair value as of both the settlement date and the November 28, 2018, acquisition date) were returned to us and retired, (ii) the remaining $0.4 million note payable we owed to a seller was cancelled and (iii) certain open grain purchase contracts with entities related to a seller were terminated. We recorded a gain on the noncash settlement of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, which is included in other income. In connection with the foregoing, a settlement agreement was entered into among the parties. All shares of common stock were distributed and the escrow agreement was terminated.
