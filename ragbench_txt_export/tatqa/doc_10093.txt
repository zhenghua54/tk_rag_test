The concentration of credit risk for our trading balances is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by customerfacing unit. Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation.
