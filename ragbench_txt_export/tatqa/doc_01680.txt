As at 31 December 2019, management considers that any reasonable changes in foreign exchange rates of the above currencies against the two major functional currencies would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results, as the net carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiaries’ functional currency are considered to be not significant, given the exchange rate peg between HKD and USD. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for foreign exchange risk.
