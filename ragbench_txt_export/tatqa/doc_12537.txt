(1) Effective July 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" (Topic 606) using the cumulative effect approach. We applied the standard to contracts that were not completed as of the date of the initial adoption. Results for reporting periods commencing on July 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard, while prior period results continue to be reported under the previous standard.
