As noted above, it was determined under a quantitative assessment that there was no impairment of goodwill. However, if we become aware of indicators of impairment in future periods, we may be required to perform an interim assessment for some or all of our reporting units before the next annual assessment. Examples of such indicators may include a decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, a decline in current market multiples, a decline in our common stock price, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of. In the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above, we may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
