At December 31, 2019, we had $5.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and $0.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. In addition, we had $7.7 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. We had $74.0 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2019, of which $35.8 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.
