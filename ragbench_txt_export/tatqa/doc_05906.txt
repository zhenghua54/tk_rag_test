Bell Wireline adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.7% in 2019, compared to last year, reflecting the growth in revenues as operating expenses were relatively stable year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 43.8% in 2019, compared to the 43.4% achieved last year, resulting from the favourable impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 and the flow-through of the service revenue growth, offset in part by higher low-margin product sales in our total revenue base.
