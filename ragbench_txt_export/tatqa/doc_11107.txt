As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on $16.0 million of its U.S. domestic deferred tax assets, largely attributable to acquired federal capital loss carryforwards for which the Company does not have sufficient income in the character to realize that attribute, and state carryforward attributes that are expected to expire before sufficient income can be realized in those jurisdictions. The remaining valuation allowance on deferred tax assets approximates $60.2 million and is associated primarily with operations in Austria, Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2019, there is not sufficient positive evidence to conclude that such deferred tax assets, presently reduced by a valuation allowance, will be recognized. The December 31, 2019 valuation allowance balance reflects an increase of $45.3 million during the year. The change in the valuation allowance is primarily due to increases from acquired Artesyn positions and current year activity, partially offset by decreases due to foreign exchange movements
