In May 2019, we divested our grid-tied central solar inverter repair and service operation. In conjunction with the divesture, the initial product warranty for the previously sold grid-tied central solar inverters was transferred to the buyer. Accordingly, a gain of $8.6 million net of tax expense of $2.4 million was recognized in Other income (expense) and Provision (benefit) for income taxes, respectively, in our discontinued operations for the year December 31, 2019. Operating income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, also includes the impacts of changes in our estimated product warranty liability, the recovery of accounts receivable and foreign exchange gain or (losses).
