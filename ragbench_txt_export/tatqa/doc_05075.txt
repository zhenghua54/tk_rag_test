The current year income tax provision includes a reduction of the Company’s valuation allowance due to the establishment of a deferred tax liability in connection with the issuance of convertible debt. The establishment of that deferred tax liability created “future taxable income” for the utilization of existing deferred tax assets of the Company, resulting in the $4 million reduction of the Company’s valuation allowance.
