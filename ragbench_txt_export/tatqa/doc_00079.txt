NEXTDC Limited acquired Asia Pacific Data Centre ("APDC") on 18 October 2018 (refer to note 26). Prior to acquisition, APDC was the landlord of three of NEXTDCâ€™s data centre facilities: M1 Melbourne, S1 Sydney and P1 Perth. For the year ended 30 June 2018, NEXTDC paid rent and ancillary amounts to APDC totalling $13.8 million that was included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in Data centre facility costs. On early adoption of AASB 16 from 1 July 2018, this rent ceased to be a Data centre facility cost, and became a depreciation expense and finance cost, until 18 October 2018, when the three leases were derecognised on acquisition.
