Furniture and fixtures, computer software and equipment, leasehold improvements and real property are recorded at cost and presented net of depreciation. We record land at historical cost. During the application development phase, we record capitalized development costs in our construction in progress account and then reclass the asset to internal-use software when the project is ready for its intended use, which is usually when the code goes into production. Furniture, fixtures and office equipment and computer software and hardware are depreciated on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from three to five years. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the asset lives. Real property is amortized on a straightline basis over lives ranging from 15 to 39 years.
