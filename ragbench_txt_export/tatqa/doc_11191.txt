Revenue in the period of $710.6 million comprised $394.1 million from the recognition of prior-period deferred revenues and $316.5 million from in-period billings. The majority of the Groupâ€™s billings, which are recognised over the life of the contract, relate to subscription products (FY19: 84.8 per cent; FY18: 83.8 per cent), with the benefit from increased billings being spread over a number of years on the subsequent recognition of deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the period of $742.1 million increased $13.5 million year-on-year, an increase of 1.9 per cent. This was mainly due to a net deferral of billings amounting to $49.7 million partially offset by a net currency revaluation of $36.2 million, a consequence of the weakening of the euro and sterling against the US dollar during the year. Deferred revenue due within one year at the balance sheet date of $428.6M increased by 5.1 per cent at actual rates or by 10.7 per cent in constant currency.
