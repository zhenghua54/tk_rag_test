Audit Fees consist of fees billed for the annual audit of our Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the statutory audit of the financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries and consultations on complex accounting issues relating to the annual audit. Audit Fees also include services that only our independent external auditor can reasonably provide, such as comfort letters and carve-out audits in connection with strategic transactions.
