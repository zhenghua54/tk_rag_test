On a fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contractâ€™s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by the customer.
