Revenue growth rates 

Revenue growth rates used are based on management’s latest four-year plan. Four-year growth rates averaged between 8.8% to 12.1% for these CGUs (Board & Systems - Americas 8.8%, Board & Systems - EMEA 12.1% and Parts Analytics and Search 11.8%). Sensitivity testing was performed on these CGUs and a reasonably possible decline in these rates would not cause the carrying value of any of these CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
