In April 2019, we issued the shipyard with a Final Notice to Proceed with conversion works that had been initiated under the Limited Notice to Proceed. We also completed the sale of 30% of the total issued ordinary share capital of Gimi MS Corp to First FLNG Holdings (see note 5). The estimated conversion cost of the Gimi is approximately $1.3 billion.
