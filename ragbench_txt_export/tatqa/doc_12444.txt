Impairment of long-term assets: Impairment of long-term assets increased by $42.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 due to a:
• $34.3 million impairment charge on vessel and equipment associated with our LNG carrier, the Golar Viking. In March 2019, we signed an agreement with LNG Hrvatska for the future sale of the Golar Viking once converted into an FSRU, following the completion of its current charter lease term. Although the sale is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of 2020, the transaction triggered an immediate impairment test. As the current carrying value of the vessel exceeds the price that a market participant would pay for the vessel at the measurement date, a non-cash impairment charge of $34.3 million was recognized. The fair value was based on average broker valuations as of the measurement date and represents the exit price in the principal LNG carrier sales market; and
• $7.3 million impairment charge associated with our investment in OLT Offshore LNG Toscana S.P.A. ("OLT-O"). In May 2019, a major shareholder in OLT-O sold its shareholding which triggered an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our 2.6% investment in OLT-O. As the carrying value of our investment exceeded the representative fair value, we wrote off our investment.
