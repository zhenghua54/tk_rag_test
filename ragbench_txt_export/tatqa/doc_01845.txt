Goodwill consists of the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Autodesk tests goodwill for impairment annually in its fourth fiscal quarter or more often if circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist, or if events have affected the composition of reporting units.
