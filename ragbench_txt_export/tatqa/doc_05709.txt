Under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporationâ€™s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a 50 percent cumulative change in ownership of the Company over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under U.S. state tax laws.
