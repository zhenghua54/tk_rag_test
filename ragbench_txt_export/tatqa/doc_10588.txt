With our ability to generate positive operating cash flows, our total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus current interest-bearing debt securities) of â‚¬13.7 billion, our unused lines of credit, and our credit ratings at year-end, we believe that we have sufficient flexibility to fund our capital requirements. Also in our opinion, our operating net working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.
