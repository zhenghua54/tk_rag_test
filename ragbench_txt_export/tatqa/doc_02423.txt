BCE free cash flow generated in Q4 2019 was $894 million, compared to $1,022 million in Q4 2018. The decrease was mainly attributable to higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher cash flows from operating activities, excluding voluntary DB pension plan contributions and acquisition and other costs paid.
