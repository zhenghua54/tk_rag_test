We have two Restricted Stock Unit Award Plans for our employees and non-employee directors, a 2017 Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan (the “2017 RSU Plan”) and a 2014 Restricted Stock Unit Award Plan (the “2014 RSU Plan”). Vesting of an RSU entitles the holder to receive a share of our common stock on a distribution date. Our non-employee director awards allow for non-employee directors to receive payment in cash, instead of stock, for up to 40% of each RSU award. The portion of the RSU awards subject to cash settlement are recorded as a liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as they vest and being marked-to-market each reporting period until they are distributed. The liability was $29 thousand and $11 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
