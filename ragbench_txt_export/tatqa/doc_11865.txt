On a statutory basis, cash generated from operations was £80.2m compared to £89.4m in 2017/18. Cash generated from operating activities was £57.7m in the year after deducting net interest paid of £22.5m, which includes the partial repayment of the loan note from Hovis as described above. Cash used in investing activities was £17.7m in 2018/19 compared to £17.9m in the prior year. Cash used in financing activities was £35.8m in the year versus £7.2m cash generated in 2017/18. This was due to the repayment of the £325m fixed rate notes due March 2021, partly offset by proceeds received from the issue of £300m floating rate notes due October 2023 and the payment of financing fees as described above.
