Because of our losses in current and prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the valuation allowance, however, could be reduced in the near term. The exact timing will be based on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve and our visibility into future results. Our recorded tax rate may increase in subsequent periods following a valuation release. Any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes.
