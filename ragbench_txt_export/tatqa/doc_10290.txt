Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of EBITDA. Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the Group. On adoption of AASB 16 from 1 July 2018, associated lease interest is allocated to the respective segments as a finance charge.
