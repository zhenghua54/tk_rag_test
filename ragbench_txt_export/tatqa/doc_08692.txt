In accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant performance shares to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goal for one-third of the target number of performance shares for the three-year performance period ending in fiscal 2019 (the "2019 performance period") is based on our fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital, subject to certain adjustments. The fiscal 2017 EBITDA return on capital target, when set, excluded the results of Lamb Weston. The performance goal for the final two-thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the 2019 performance period is based on our diluted EPS compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"), subject to certain adjustments, measured over the two-year period ending in fiscal 2019. In addition, for certain participants, all performance shares for the 2019 performance period are subject to an overarching EPS goal that must be met in each fiscal year of the 2019 performance period before any payout on the performance shares can be made to such participants. The awards actually earned for the 2019 performance period will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for that period.
