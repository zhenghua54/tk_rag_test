Gross unallocated expenses, which represent the unallocated loss from operations excluding the impact of revenue, totaled $478 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $533 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of (i) lower asset impairment and goodwill charges of $35 million, (ii) lower net transaction-related severance and legal expenses of $16 million and (iii) lower acquisition related amortization of $1 million. These were partially offset with $3 million in additional stock-based compensation expense.
