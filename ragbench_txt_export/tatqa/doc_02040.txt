The amounts in the table below exclude $373 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably

estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this

2019 Form 10-K for further discussion. The amounts in the table below also exclude $10 million associated with funding
