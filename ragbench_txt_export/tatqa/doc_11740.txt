Foodservice operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $121.8 million, an increase of $16.7 million, or 16%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $13.9 million higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the impact of inflation-driven increases in pricing and supply chain realized productivity, partially offset by lower sales volumes and increased input costs. Operating profit of the Foodservice segment was impacted by charges of $1.8 million in fiscal 2017 in connection with our restructuring plans.
