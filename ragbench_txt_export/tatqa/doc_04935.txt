As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, the opening balances as of August 31, 2018 for receivables, other current assets, and other current liabilities increased due to the reclassification of allowances for rebates, pricing adjustments, and returns to conform to the new presentation requirements. In addition, the margin from previously deferred sales to distributors was reclassified from other current liabilities to retained earnings. The tax effects of the adoption of ASC 606 were recorded primarily as a reduction of net deferred tax assets, substantially as a result of recognizing income for accounting purposes earlier under ASC 606 than for tax purposes in various jurisdictions.
