Construction markets continued their stable growth during the fiscal year, particularly in the U. S. and China and in the non-residential construction market overall. Growth in the important building electrification and automation market was driven by demand for building performance and sustainability offerings, including strong demand for energy efficiency and digital services. In fiscal 2020, market growth overall is expected to
be lower than in fiscal 2019, due to an expected continuation of the downturn in the short-cycle markets, economic uncertainty in a number of countries due to trade conflicts, and other factors.
