We have decided to voluntarily comply with the UK government’s Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) policy a year early. The table below represents Unilever’s energy use and associated GHG emissions from electricity and fuel in the UK for the 2018 and 2019 reporting years (1 October to 30 September), with scope calculations aligned to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The scope of this data includes 8 manufacturing sites and 11 non-manufacturing sites based in the UK. The UK accounts for 5% of our global total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, outlined in our mandatory GHG reporting also on this page.
