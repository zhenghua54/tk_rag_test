We believe our current world-wide cash balances together with expected future cash flows to be generated from operations and our committed credit facility will be sufficient to support current operations. A significant amount of cash and expected future cash flows are located outside of the U.S. Of the $83.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of April 27, 2019, $69.9 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. and can be repatriated, primarily through the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of dividends, without creating material additional income tax expense.
