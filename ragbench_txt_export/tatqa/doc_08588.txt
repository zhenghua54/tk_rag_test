As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $343.6 million and $566.3 million, respectively. We finance our operations primarily through sales to our customers and a majority of our customers are billed monthly. For customers with annual or multi-year contracts and those who opt for annual invoicing, we generally invoice only one annual period in advance and all invoicing occurs at the start of the respective subscription period. Revenue is deferred for such advanced billings. We also finance our operations from proceeds from issuance of stock under our stock plans, and proceeds from issuance of debt. We believe that our operations and existing liquidity sources will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months
