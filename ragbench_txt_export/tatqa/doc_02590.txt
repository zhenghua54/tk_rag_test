In January 2019, we exercised our option to acquire Intel's interest in IMFT. Subsequently, Intel set the closing date to occur on October 31, 2019, at which time IMFT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay Intel approximately $1.4 billion in cash for Intel's noncontrolling interest in IMFT and IMFT member debt. Pursuant to the terms of the IMFT wafer supply agreement, Intel notified us of its election to receive supply from IMFT from the closing date through April 2020 at a volume equal to approximately 50% of their volume from IMFT in the six-month period prior to closing.
