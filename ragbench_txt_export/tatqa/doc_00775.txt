As of December 31, 2019, we held a 32.0% (2018: 32.0%) ownership interest in Golar Partners (including our 2% general partner interest) and 100% of the incentive distribution rights ("IDRs"). The decrease in the share of net earnings in Golar Partners is due to a decrease in underlying performance of Golar Partners and fair value adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the share of net earnings in Golar Partners is offset by the movement of the impairment charge of $149.4 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018.
