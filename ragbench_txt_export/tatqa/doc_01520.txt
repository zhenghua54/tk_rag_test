Net sales from our modules segment increased by $958.1 million in 2019 primarily due to a 180% increase in the volume of watts sold and a 4% increase in the average selling price per watt. Net sales from our systems segment decreased by $139.0 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of the Mashiko and certain India projects in 2018 and the completion of substantially all construction activities at the California Flats, Willow Springs, and various other projects in Florida in late 2018 and early 2019, partially offset by the sale of the Sun Streams, Sunshine Valley, and Beryl projects and ongoing construction activities at the Phoebe and GA Solar 4 projects in 2019.
