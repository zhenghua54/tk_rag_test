In December 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of $3.3 million for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. The provisional amount was based on information available at that time, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized our transition tax calculation and recorded additional tax expense of $0.3 million. In December 2017, we also recorded a provisional write-down to deferred tax assets of $0.7 million related to changes in Section 162(m), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, regarding deductions for excessive employee compensation. In 2018, we finalized our calculation under Section 162(m) and recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million. We also recorded a one-time tax benefit in December 2017 of $1.2 million from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21%. As of December 31, 2018, we completed the accounting for all of the impacts of the Act. Act”), resulting in significant modifications to existing law.
