For equity awards granted under the Pivotal equity plan, volatility was based on the volatility of a group of comparable public companies based on size, stage of life cycle, profitability, growth and other factors. The expected term was estimated using the simplified method and was determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options. Pivotalâ€™s expected dividend yield input was zero as the Company has not historically paid regular dividends on its common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term was consistent with the expected term of the stock options.
