In 2013, Teekay LNG acquired two 155,900-cubic meter LNG carriers, the WilPride and WilForce, from Norway-based Awilco LNG ASA (or Awilco) and chartered them back to Awilco on five- and four-year fixed-rate bareboat charter contracts (plus a one-year extension option), respectively, with Awilco holding a fixed-price purchase obligation at the end of the charters. The bareboat charters with Awilco were accounted for as direct financing leases.
