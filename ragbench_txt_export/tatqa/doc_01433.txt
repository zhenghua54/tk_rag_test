The market price per share of Prozone at 31 December 2019 was INR19 (31 December 2018: INR29), valuing the Group’s interest at £9.9 million (31 December 2018: £16.4 million) compared with the Prozone carrying value pre-impairment of £41.5 million (31 December 2018: £45.1 million). As the share price of Prozone is lower than its carrying value, a review of the carrying value of Prozone and the Group’s direct interest in Empire (as it also forms part of the Prozone group) has been undertaken. Underpinning the impairment assessment (where the fair value less costs to sell was considered) were the independent third-party valuations received for the investment and development properties, representing the underlying value of the associate’s net assets. Assumptions were also made for tax and other costs that would be reasonably expected if these assets were to be disposed of. Following this review, an impairment of £7.4 million was recognised.
