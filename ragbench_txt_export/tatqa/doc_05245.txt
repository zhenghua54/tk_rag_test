Research and development expenses increased $15.0 million, or 24%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase was principally due to the 2018 Reallocation of headcount from sales and marketing to research and development, as well as investments to maintain and improve the functionality of our products. As a result, we incurred increased employee-related costs of $12.1 million.
