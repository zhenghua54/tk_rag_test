The bareboat charters-in provide for variable lease payments in the form of profit share to the owners of the vessels calculated in accordance with the respective charter agreements or based on time charter sublease revenue. Because such amounts and the periods impacted are not reasonably estimable, they are not currently reflected in the table above. Due to reserve funding requirements and current rate forecasts, no profits are currently expected to be paid to the owners in respect of the charter term within the next year.
