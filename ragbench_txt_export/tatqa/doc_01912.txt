The Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction. The Company evaluated its ability to realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets and weighed all available positive and negative evidence both objective and subjective in nature. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the weight given to positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. Consideration was given to negative evidence such as: the duration and severity of losses in prior years, high seasonal revenue concentrations, increasing competitive pressures, and a challenging retail environment. Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon its generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.
