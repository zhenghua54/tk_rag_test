Cash flow from operating activities was up by â‚¬1.0 billion mainly driven by working capital improvement in 2019 compared to the prior year which was impacted by the disposal of spreads. Gross margin improvement had a favourable contribution a result of strong delivery from 5-S savings programmes. Overheads and brand and marketing efficiencies also had a favourable contribution as a result of our zero-based-budgeting programme.
