In 2015, the Group established a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). All eligible employees were awarded free shares (or nil-cost options in the case of employees in Ireland) valued at £3,600 each based on the share price at the time of the Company’s admission to the Stock Exchange in March 2015, subject to a three-year service period (‘Vesting Period’). The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. There are no performance conditions applicable to the vesting of SIP shares. The fair value of the SIP awards at the grant date was measured to be £2.72 using the Black-Scholes model. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the Vesting Period.
