Net interest paid was £7.9m lower in the year at £30.1m, reflecting the timing of interest payable on the £300m fixed rate notes due October 2023 which were issued in the first half of the year. This is a one-off benefit to cash interest paid; in 2019/20 cash interest is expected to be in the range of £35-39m. No taxation was paid in the period due to the availability of brought forward losses and capital allowances, however, a payment of £1.0m was received in the prior period from Irish tax authorities in respect of tax paid in prior years.
