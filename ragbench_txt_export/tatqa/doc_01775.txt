The Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per ordinary share by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The Company has excluded other potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding options to purchase ordinary shares and unvested restricted share units (RSUs), from the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding as their inclusion in the computation for all periods would be anti-dilutive due to net losses incurred.
