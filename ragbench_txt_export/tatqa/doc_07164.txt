For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of our revenue constant currency growth rate to revenue, as reported, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see Item 6. “Selected Financial Data.” As our total revenue grew over the past three years, our revenue constant currency growth rate has decreased over the same period, as the incremental growth from period to period represented a smaller percentage of total revenue as compared to the prior period.
