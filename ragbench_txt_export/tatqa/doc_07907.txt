The Company performed the annual impairment assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit as of December 31, 2019, noting no impairment loss. The fair value exceeded the carrying value by 2.4%. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment. We estimate fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiples analysis with respect to our single reporting unit. These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth rates, our cost of capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, and other variables. Assumptions used in our valuations were consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. Our discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by a change in the competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies, a loss of a significant customer, or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. Additionally, under the market approach analysis, we used significant other observable inputs including various guideline company comparisons. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of the quantitative goodwill test for our one reporting unit.
