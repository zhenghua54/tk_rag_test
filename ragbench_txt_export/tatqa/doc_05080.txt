We have a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans ("pension plans") covering approximately 3% of our active employees. Pension plans covering salaried employees provide pension benefits that are based on the employeesÂ´ years of service and compensation prior to retirement. Pension plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.
