In connection with the issuance of the $10.0 million secured promissory notes in December 2013, we issued common stock purchase warrants (“warrants”) exercisable for 60 thousand shares of our common stock having an exercise price of $2.52 per share (after giving effect to our one-for-five reverse stock split) with an expiration date in December 2020. These warrants contain a cashless exercise feature (See Note 7).
