Looking forward, we would expect capital expenditure in 2020 to be at a similar level of approximately Â£65 million as we finish the Aflex facility but increase spending on project OPAL, the implementation of a global IT system for the Steam Specialties business. We generate significant cash and our first priority is to reinvest in the business, taking opportunities to generate good returns from increased efficiency, reduced costs and flexibility.
