The 2020 PSP awards will vest based on (i) 50 per cent of each award – relative Total Shareholder Return vs a bespoke real estate sector peer group (this group being expanded from the very small groups used previously) and (ii) 50 per cent of each award – intu’s Total Property Return vs the MSCI UK Shopping Centre benchmark. This mix of metrics represents a change from the 2019 awards which were based 50 per cent each on relative and absolute TSR targets subject to a Remuneration Committee-operated discretionary assessment of underlying financial performance. It is intended that awards will vest three years following grant (with an additional two year post vesting holding period applying to the net number of shares that vest if the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to apply such additional condition).
