The 6% increase in finance costs this year was a result of: • interest on lease liabilities as a result of our adoption of IFRS 16; and • higher outstanding debt as a result of our debt issuances in April 2019, in large part to fund our acquisition of 600 MHz spectrum licences (see “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”); partially offset by • a $21 million loss on discontinuation of hedge accounting on certain bond forward derivatives recognized in 2018.
