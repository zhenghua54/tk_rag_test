In October 2018, we granted 464,888 PSUs with certain financial targets. These PSUs will become eligible to
vest at 75% upon the achievement of the performance targets by December 31, 2020, and are subject to service
condition vesting requirements. The remaining 25% of these PSUs will become eligible to vest on the first
anniversary of the initial vesting date. None of these PSUs were vested as of December 31, 2019.
