Devices sold represents the number of wearable devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings with differing U.S. manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.
