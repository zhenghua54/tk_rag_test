In some cases, we may offer customers the option to purchase extended warranties to ensure protection beyond the standard warranty period. In those circumstances, the warranty is considered a distinct service and we account for the extended warranty as a performance obligation and allocate a portion of the transaction price to that performance obligation. More frequently, customers do not purchase a warranty separately. In those situations, we account for the warranty as an assurance-type warranty, which provides customers with assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, and this does not represent a separate performance obligation. Such warranties are recorded separately as liabilities and presented within ‘‘accrued liabilities’’ and ‘‘other long-term liabilities’’ on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 5. Balance Sheet Components).
