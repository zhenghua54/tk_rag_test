For the three business combinations in fiscal 2019, the determination of estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities is derived from estimated fair value assessments and assumptions by Autodesk. For PlanGrid and BuildingConnected, Autodesk's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). For the three business combinations in fiscal 2019, the tax impact of the acquisition is also subject to change within the measurement period. Different estimates and assumptions could result in different valuations assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the resulting amount of goodwill.
