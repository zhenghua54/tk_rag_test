Europe revenues increased $749,000 or 2% in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to the increase in Travel revenues, the decrease in Local revenues and a $1.8 million negative impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The increase in Travel revenue of $2.9 million was primarily due to the increased number of emails sent. The decrease in Local revenues of $292,000 was primarily due to the decreased number of Local Deals vouchers sold.
