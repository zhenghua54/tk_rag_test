A deferred tax asset can only be recorded for the portion of a potential benefit where utilisation is considered probable. The assessment of future taxable amounts involves the use of assumptions and management judgments. The Group has fully recognised a deferred tax asset of $79.3m in relation to assets previously transferred to USA. It is considered probable that there will be future taxable income in the USA to fully realise these temporary differences.
