In April 2012, the Company established a controlled trust called the Eros International Plc Employee Benefit Trust (“JSOP Trust”). The JSOP Trust purchased 2,000,164 shares of the Company out of funds borrowed from the Company and repayable on demand. The Company’s Board, Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends to the JSOP Trust certain employees, officers and key management personnel, to whom the JSOP Trust will be required to grant shares from its holdings at nominal price. Such shares are then held by the JSOP Trust and the scheme is referred to as the “JSOP Plan.” The shares held by the JSOP Trust are reported as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and termed as ‘JSOP reserves’.
