Restructure and asset impairments primarily relate to our continued emphasis to centralize certain key functions. In addition, in 2019, we finalized the sale of our 200mm fabrication facility in Singapore and recognized restructure gains of $128 million. In 2017, we recognized net restructure gains of $15 million related to the sale of our Lexar assets; our assets associated with our 200mm fabrication facility in Singapore; and our 40% ownership interest in Tera Probe, Inc and assembly and test facility located in Akita, Japan.
