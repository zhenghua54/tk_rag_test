Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period, as calculated using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities primarily include unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”), including PSU awards, and stock options, including purchase options under VMware’s employee stock purchase plan, which included Pivotal’s employee stock purchase plan through the date of acquisition. Securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. VMware uses the two-class method to calculate net income per share as both classes share the same rights in dividends; therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for both classes.
