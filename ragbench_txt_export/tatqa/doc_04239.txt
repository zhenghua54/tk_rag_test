The OLT primarily uses the statutory measures of Revenue and Operating profit to assess the performance of the one operating segment. To assist in the analysis of the Groupâ€™s revenue-generating trends, the OLT reviews revenue at a disaggregated level as detailed within note 5. The revenue from external parties reported to the OLT is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.
