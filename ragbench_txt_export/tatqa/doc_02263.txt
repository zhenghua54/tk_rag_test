Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.
