At times, our cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. The Company believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these balances based on its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of these financial institutions. Further, our cash equivalents may expose us to credit risk; however, we believe this risk is limited, as the investments are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
