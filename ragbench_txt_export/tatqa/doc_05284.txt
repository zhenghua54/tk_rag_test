In December 2015, we completed the wind down of engineering, manufacturing and sales of our solar inverter product line (the "inverter business"). Accordingly, the results of our inverter business have been reflected as “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented herein.
