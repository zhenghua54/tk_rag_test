The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $20.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $2.2 billion, a net decrease in debt of $1.1 billion, and capital expenditures of $0.9 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $15.8 billion and the timing of settlements of investments and other of $2.0 billion.
