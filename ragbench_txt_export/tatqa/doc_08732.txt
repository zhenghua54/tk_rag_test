The FCR liability is carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is estimated based on historical experience and management’s expectation of future FCR. The FCR liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as the primary component of the fair value is obtained from unobservable inputs based on the Company’s data, reasonably adjusted for assumptions that would be used by market participants. The following table reconciles the beginning and ending fair value measurements of our FCR liability during the periods indicated.
