The performance rights plan was established by the Board of Directors to provide long-term incentives to the Group’s Senior Executives based on total shareholder returns (TSR) taking into account the Group’s financial and operational performance. Under the Plan, eligible participants may be granted performance rights on terms and conditions determined by the Board from time to time. Performance rights were granted during the course of FY17, FY18 and FY19. The vesting conditions for grants relate to TSR exceeding the ASX 200 Accumulation Index over the measurement period. Vesting of the rights will be tested on or around the day following the release of each of the annual results for the years ended 30 June 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively.
