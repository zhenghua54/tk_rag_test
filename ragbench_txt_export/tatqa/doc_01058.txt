In conjunction with the Tax Act, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (‘‘SAB 118’’) directing taxpayers to record the impact of the Tax Act as ‘‘provisional’’ when they do not have all the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740. The guidance allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impact. In accordance with SAB 118, we recorded provisional estimates to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 based on the Tax Act. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we further analyzed the income tax effects of the Tax Act and determined there were no material changes to the provisional amounts disclosed in our fiscal 2018 financial statements. Although our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is complete under SAB 118, there may be future adjustments based on interpretations by the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations, legislative updates or new regulations, or changes in accounting standards for income taxes.
