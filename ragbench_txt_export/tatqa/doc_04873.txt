Changes in government regulation and consumer eating habits may impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings, or require us to disclose the nutritional content of our menu offerings. For example, a number of states, counties, and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act requires chain restaurants to publish calorie information on their menus and menu boards. These and other requirements may increase our expenses, slow customersâ€™ ordering process, or negatively influence the demand for our offerings; all of which can impact sales and profitability.
