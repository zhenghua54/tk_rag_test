The computation of diluted net loss per share does not include shares that are anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method because their exercise prices are higher than the average market value of Autodeskâ€™s stock during the fiscal year. The effect of 0.5 million, 0.5 million, and 0.1 million potentially anti-dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of net loss per share for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
