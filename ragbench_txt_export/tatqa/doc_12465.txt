We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in which certain members of management and all nonemployee
directors are eligible to participate. Participants may defer a portion of their compensation until retirement
or another date specified by them in accordance with the plan. We are funding the plan obligations through cash
deposits to a Rabbi Trust that are invested in various equity, bond and money market mutual funds in generally the
same proportion as investment elections made by the participants. The deferred compensation plan liability is included
in Other Non-Current Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
