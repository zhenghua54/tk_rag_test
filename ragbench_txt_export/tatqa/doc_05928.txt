Our material capital commitments consist of obligations under facilities and operating leases. Some of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under leases on a straight-line basis. We anticipate that we will experience an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments as a result of our anticipated growth in operations, infrastructure, personnel and resources devoted to building our brand name.
