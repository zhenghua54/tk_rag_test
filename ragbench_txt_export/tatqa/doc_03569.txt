Gross profit percentage decreased 23.8 percentage points to negative 3.6% in 2019 from 20.2% in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to operating losses at Golden Ridge due to an unfavorable contract to sell medium grain rice entered into by the seller of the mill and low levels of plant utilization in the latter half of the year while the mill was going through a planned upgrade cycle. With this project completed in early January 2020, we expect to see improved productivity and a positive contribution margin from Golden Ridge in 2020.
