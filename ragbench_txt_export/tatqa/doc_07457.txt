Fiscal 2019 income taxes expense amounted to $83.7 million compared to a recovery of $17.2 million for the prior year mainly attributable to: • the effect of the federal rate reduction in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in the United States; • the increase in profit before income taxes which is mostly related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and • the appreciation of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the prior year.
