We assess positive and negative evidence for each jurisdiction to determine whether it is more likely than not that existing deferred tax assets will be realized. As of August 29, 2019, and August 30, 2018, we had a valuation allowance of $277 million and $228 million, respectively, against our net deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in Japan. Changes in 2019 in the valuation allowance were due to adjustments based on management's assessment of tax credits and net operating losses that are more likely than not to be realized.
