On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduced the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time, noncash net tax benefit of $110.9 million related to the revaluation of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Act.
