In addition, in conjunction with our 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings of Stockholders, we granted RSUs to certain members of our Board of Directors in respect of the annual equity compensation under our non-employee director compensation policy (other members of our Board of Directors elected to receive their annual equity compensation for Board service in the form of stock units under our Deferred Compensation Plan as described below). In 2019 and 2018, we granted 11,600 and 16,286, respectively, RSUs to members of our Board of Directors in respect of the annual equity compensation under our non-employee director compensation policy. RSUs issued to our Board of Directors vest at the earlier of the one-year anniversary of their grant or the next annual stockholders' meeting. In 2019 and 2018, 16,286 and 129,865 RSUs, respectively, vested.
