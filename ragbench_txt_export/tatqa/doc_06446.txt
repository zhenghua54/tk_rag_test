——Product: Our product lever contributed £121 (2018: £86) and 81% (2018: 58%) of total ARPR growth. Our annual event allowed us to introduce two new products, stock exports and profile pages, into all package levels and we also monetised our Dealer Finance product following a trial period. Since 1 April 2018, over 5,000 retailers have opted to pay for the opportunity to advertise their finance offers against their cars, representing 70% of all eligible retailers. In addition, the penetration of our higher yielding Advanced and Premium advertising packages has continued to grow as retailers recognise the value of receiving greater prominence within our search listings. At the end of March, 19% of retailer cars advertised were on one of these levels (March 2018: 12%). There was also a small contribution from our Managing products, which despite re-platforming and continued development in the year, still saw growth to 3,200 customers (2018: 3,000).
