Although the Company cannot predict the timing of resolution with taxing authorities, if any, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by $1.5 million in the next 12 months due to settlement with tax authorities or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The Company did not recognize any additional tax benefit or expense for interest and penalties during the year ended December 31, 2019.
