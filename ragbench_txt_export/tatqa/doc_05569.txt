In June 2018, one of our ATBs was berthed to the dock when a third-party ship transiting the channel hit our ATB, causing structural damage to the ATB and damage to the dock. The cost of repairs has been covered by existing insurance policies. We have filed a lawsuit against the third-party ship seeking recovery of our costs of repairs as well as our lost earnings from the ATB being off-hire for 46 repair days.
