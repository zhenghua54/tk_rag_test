For the year ended April 30, 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash write-down of approximately $5.6 million of inventory. Inventory write-down resulted from two principal factors: (1) adoption by satellite manufacturers of policies precluding the use of parts and components over ten years old. This policy was unanticipated and resulted in reduced likelihood of FEI being able to use inventory that exceeds that threshold, and (2) changing technology associated with the advanced analog-to-digital converters which enables direct synthesis of certain frequencies for which FEI previously provided frequency conversion technology, reducing the likelihood that some parts and components associated with frequency conversion will be usable. Additionally, the Companyâ€™s new inventory reserve policy resulted in a charge of $1.1 million in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019. Inventory reserves included in inventory were $6.6 million and $5.5 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
