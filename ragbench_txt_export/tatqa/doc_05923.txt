Autodesk regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, Autodesk considers both positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, Autodesk considered cumulative losses arising from the Company's business model transition as a significant piece of negative evidence. Consequently, Autodesk determinedÂ that a valuation allowance was required on the accumulated U.S., Canada and Singapore tax attributes. In the current year, the U.S. created incremental deferred tax assets, primarily operating losses, foreign tax and R&D credits, Singapore generated operating losses and Canada generated R&D credits. These U.S. and Singapore deferred tax attributes have been offset by a full valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $163.6 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to the generation of deferred tax attributes. The valuation allowance decreased by $113.8 million, and increased $352.4 million in fiscal 2018, and 2017, respectively, primarily related to U.S. Tax Act reduction in rate in fiscal 2018 and U.S. and Canadian deferred tax attributes generated in fiscal 2017. As Autodesk continually strives to optimize the overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent allowing the Company to realize many of the deferred tax assets that are offset by a valuation allowance; therefore, Autodesk will continue to evaluate the ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets each quarter, both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative.
