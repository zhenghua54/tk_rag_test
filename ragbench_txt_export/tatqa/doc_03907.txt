As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our cash and cash equivalents were $73.8 million and $105.5 million and short-term investments were $33.2 million and $3.2 million, which provided available short-term liquidity of $107.0 million and $108.7 million. Of these amounts, our foreign subsidiaries held cash of $52.3 million and $87.1 million, respectively, representing approximately 48.9% and 80.1% of available short-term liquidity, which is used to fund on-going liquidity needs of these subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. except to the extent any of these funds can be repatriated without withholding tax and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate to fund domestic operations. However, if all of these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to tax. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of such earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the amount of funds subject to unrecognized deferred tax liability.
