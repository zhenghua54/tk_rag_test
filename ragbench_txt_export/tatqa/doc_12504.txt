(5) Collateral held against the Margin Loan facility is required to satisfy one of the mandatory prepayment events within the facility, with this having been triggered when the closing price of the Golar Partners common units pledged by us as security for the obligations under the facility fell below a defined threshold. If certain requirements are met, the facility allows for the release of the collateral (see note 18).
