We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our global operations in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized the following income tax expense: $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, for the potential payment of interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $1.7 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We conduct business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United State federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-US income tax examinations for the years before 2012. Due to the expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions globally during 2020, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $3.1 million.
