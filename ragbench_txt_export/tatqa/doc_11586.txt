Gross profit increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to acquisitions. From a revenue mix perspective, gross profit associated with our recurring revenue streams, which include the delivery of recurring subscription-based software sales, support and maintenance, and recurring client services improved as we continued to expand our customer base for these services, particularly those related to outsourcing and revenue cycle management. Gross profit associated with our non-recurring software delivery, support and maintenance revenue stream decreased primarily due to fewer perpetual software license sales of our acute and population health management solutions. Gross profit associated with our non-recurring client services revenue stream, which includes non-recurring project-based client services, decreased primarily driven by higher internal personnel costs, including those related to incremental resources from recent acquisitions. Gross margin decreased primarily due to lower sales of higher margin perpetual software licenses and higher amortization of software development and acquisition-related assets driven by additional amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as part of recent acquisitions.
