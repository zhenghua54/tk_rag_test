Net cash used in operating activities of $156.8 million in 2019 was primarily due to a net loss of $320.7 million, as well as an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $3.3 million, partially offset by total non-cash adjustments of $167.2 million. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities included a $21.3 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding, an $18.5 million increase in inventories primarily due to Fitbit Versa Lite Edition, Fitbit Inspire, Fitbit Inspire HR and Fitbit Versa 2, and a $22.9 million decrease in lease liabilities, partially offset by a $40.7 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities primarily related to higher rebates and promotional activities in the fourth quarter of 2019, a $15.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $4.0 million increase in deferred revenue. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, increased from 70 days as of December 31, 2018 to 74 days as of December 31, 2019, due to lower collections during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The $167.2 million total non-cash adjustments for 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $77.7 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $62.8 million, and non-cash lease expense of $19.2 million.
