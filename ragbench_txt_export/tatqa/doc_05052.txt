In December 2018 and May 2019, we entered into factoring arrangements with two separate third-party factor agencies related to our accounts receivable from customers in Europe. As a result of these factoring arrangements, title of certain accounts receivable balances was transferred to third-party vendors, and both arrangements were accounted for as a sale of financial assets given effective control over these financial assets has been surrendered. As a result, these financial assets have been excluded from our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the factoring arrangements, we sold accounts receivable invoices amounting to $119.4 million and $26.3 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total uncollected accounts receivable from end customers under both arrangements were $11.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively.
