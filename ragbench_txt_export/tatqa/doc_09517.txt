In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years. Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent. Standard turnover-based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail unitâ€™s annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group and recognised as income in the period in which it arises.
