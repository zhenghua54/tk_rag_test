The Group has generated operating cash flows of $39.7 million, which has been used to retire external debt and fund dividends of $12.6 million during the financial year. With the introduction of a higher level of debt in June 2019 to fund the Sigma acquisition, the Group has, for the first time, used the strength of the Group’s balance sheet to fund 100% of an acquisition. With the Group’s strong cash generation, Hansen is well placed to service and retire the debt over the coming years.
