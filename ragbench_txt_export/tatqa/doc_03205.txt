Attrition rates in Health are particularly relevant to the overall trail commission asset considering the relative size of the Health trail commission asset. Attrition rates vary substantially by provider and also by the duration of time the policy has been in force, with rates generally higher in policies under two years old. The attrition rates used in the valuation of the Health portfolio at 30 June 2019 ranged from 7.5% and 26.5% (2018: 7.5% and 26.5%). The simple average duration band attrition increase was up to 0.2% during the period, with higher increases experienced for policies that have been in force for shorter periods of time.
