As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $138.6 million and $115.8 million, respectively, of state credit carryforwards before consideration of valuation allowance or reduction for unrecognized tax benefits. If not utilized, a portion of the credits will begin to expire in varying amounts starting in 2020.
