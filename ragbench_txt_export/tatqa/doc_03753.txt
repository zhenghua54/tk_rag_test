At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2020, it is reasonably possible that resolution of reviews by taxing authorities, both domestic and foreign, could be reached with respect to an immaterial amount of net unrecognized tax benefits depending on the timing of examinations or expiration of statutes of limitations, either because our tax positions are sustained or because we agree to the disallowance and pay the related income tax. We recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The amount of net interest and penalties recognized as a component of income tax expense during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material.
