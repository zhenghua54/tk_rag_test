For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, accounting for outstanding share-based payments using the equity-settled method for stock-based compensation was determined to be more dilutive than using the cash-settled method. As a result, net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was reduced by $6 million (2018 â€“ $2 million) in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
