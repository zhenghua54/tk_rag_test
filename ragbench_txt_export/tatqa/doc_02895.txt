The Company maintains a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience, along with additional customer specific allowances. The Company regularly monitors credit risk exposures in consolidated receivables. In estimating the necessary level of our allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers the aging of accounts receivable, the creditworthiness of customers, economic conditions within the customerâ€™s industry, and general economic conditions, among other factors.
