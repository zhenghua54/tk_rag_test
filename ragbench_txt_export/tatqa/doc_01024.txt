Research and development expense increased by $8.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in employee-related costs, which includes stock-based compensation, associated with our increased headcount from 229 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 252 employees as of December 31, 2019, a $1.3 million increase in hosting and software related cost to support research and development activities and an increase of $0.4 million in office related expenses to support research and development activities. In addition, a total of $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 and $7.7 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 were capitalized, resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.
