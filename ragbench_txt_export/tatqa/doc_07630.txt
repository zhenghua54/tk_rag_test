2019 Annual LTI Grants. Except for Messrs. Dev, Trezise and Andrews, the Committee granted annual LTI
awards to our named executives in February 2019 at amounts substantially similar to the awards granted to
them in 2018. Mr. Dev’s 2019 LTI target was increased to $2,700,000, as previously approved by the Committee
upon his promotion to CFO in November 2018. Mr. Andrews’ 2019 LTI target was increased to $750,000, as
previously approved by the Committee following a review of compensation benchmarking in November 2018. In
February 2019, the Committee reviewed the compensation benchmarking data for all executive officers and
increased Mr. Trezise’s LTI target to $800,000 and left unchanged the LTI target for our other NEOs.
