On 24 June 2019, the Group reset the interest rates associated with AUD denominated interest rate swaps. This resulted in a cash outflow of $22.9m which reduced the Group’s financial liability presented in note 9.8. The cumulative change in fair value of these hedging instruments is carried in a separate reserve in equity (cash flow hedge reserve of NSPT presented within non-controlling interest in the Group’s consolidated statement of changes in equity).
