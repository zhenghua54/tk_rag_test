As consideration for the ICAR Acquisition, the Company agreed to an aggregate purchase price of up to $13.9 million, net of cash acquired. On October 16, 2017, the Company: (i) made a cash payment to Sellers of $3.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to adjustments for transaction expenses, escrow amounts, indebtedness, and working capital adjustments; and (ii) issued to Sellers 584,291 shares, or $5.6 million, of Common Stock. In addition to the foregoing, the Sellers may be entitled to additional cash consideration upon achievement of certain milestones as follows: (a) subject to achievement of the revenue target for the fourth quarter of calendar 2017, the Company will pay to Sellers up to $1.5 million (the “Q4 Consideration”), which amount shall be deposited (as additional funds) into the escrow fund described below; and (b) subject to achievement of certain revenue and net income targets for ICAR for the twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2018, and the twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2019, the Company will pay to Sellers up to $3.8 million in additional cash consideration (the “Earnout Consideration”); provided that if the revenue target set forth in clause (a) is not met, then the Q4 Consideration will instead be added to the Earnout Consideration payable upon (and subject to) achievement of the revenue and net income targets for the twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the total Q4 Consideration and Earnout Consideration to be $2.9 million on October 16, 2017, which was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology based on financial forecasts determined by management that included assumptions about revenue growth and discount rates. Each quarter the Company revises the estimated fair value of the Earnout Consideration and revises as necessary.
