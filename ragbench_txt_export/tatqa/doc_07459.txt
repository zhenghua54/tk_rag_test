On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). The tax reform reduced the general federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% starting after 2017 which reduced net deferred tax liabilities by approximately $94 million (US$74 million) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, the Act calls for other changes such as interest deductibility limitations, full deduction of acquisitions of tangible assets, net operating losses limitations as well as base erosion anti-avoidance, which together with tax rate reductions, had an overall favorable impact on the income tax expense.
