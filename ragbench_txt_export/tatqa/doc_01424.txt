Significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that are used in our impairment analysis. The estimates we used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. Although we believe our underlying assumptions supporting these assessments are reasonable, if our forecasted sales and margin growth rates, timing of growth, or the discount rate vary from our forecasts, we may be required to perform interim analyses in fiscal 2020 that could expose us to material impairment charges in the future.
