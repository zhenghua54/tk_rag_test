Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on estimated reserve percentages, which consider historical usage, known trends, inventory age and market conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our inventory reserve was $34.1 million and $30.0 million, respectively.
