Americas Billings attributable to the Americas decreased by $2.2 million to $267.8 million in the period, representing a 0.8 per cent reduction on a reported basis and 0.7 per cent on a constant currency basis; this decrease largely driven by a decline in Enduser products due to the stronger performance in the prior-year compare as a consequence of the impact of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak and the launch of Intercept X, the Groupâ€™s next-gen endpoint product, partially offset by an improved performance in UTM sales.
