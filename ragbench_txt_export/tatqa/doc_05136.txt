In November 2015, we raised net proceeds of $68.3 million in our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. In the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred operating losses of $1.2 million, $7.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. While we expect to generate an operating loss in the year ending March 31, 2020, we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities.
