At times, the Company receives orders for products that may be delivered over multiple dates that may extend across reporting periods. The Company invoices for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues for each distinct product delivered, assuming transfer of control has occurred. Generally, scheduled delivery dates are within one year, and the Company has elected to use the optional exemption whereby revenues allocated to partially completed contracts with an expected duration of one year or less are not disclosed. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no contracts with unsatisfied performance obligations with a duration of more than one year.
