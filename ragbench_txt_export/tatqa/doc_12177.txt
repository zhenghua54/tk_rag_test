We capitalize purchased software upon acquisition if it is accounted for as internal-use software or if it meets the future alternative use criteria. We capitalize incurred labor costs for software development from the time technological feasibility of the software is established, or when the preliminary project phase is completed in the case of internal-use software, until the software is available for general release. Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred.
