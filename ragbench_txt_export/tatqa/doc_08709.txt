Operating income in 2019 was $1,203 million, decreasing by $197 million compared to 2018, mainly driven by normal price pressure, increased unsaturation charges and higher R&D spending, partially offset by higher level of grants and favorable currency effects, net of hedging. Operating income in the fourth quarter grew on a sequential and year-over-year basis to $460 million compared to $336 million and $443 million in the prior quarter and year-ago quarters, respectively, mainly driven by higher revenues, improved product mix and a higher level of grants.
