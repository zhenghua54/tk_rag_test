The entire amount reflected in the table above at April 30, 2019, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. As of April 30, 2019, and 2018, the Company had $64,000 and $10,000, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized interest and penalties of $54,000 and $3,000, respectively. Although it is difficult to predict or estimate the change in the Companyâ€™s unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that decreases in unrecognized tax benefits of up to $40,000 may be recognized during the next twelve months.
