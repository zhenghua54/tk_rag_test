Our investment in international licensees at February 28, 2019 consists principally of a 12.5% equity interest in
a Mexican licensee of $1.7 million, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary as of March 19, 2019 (see Note 2), as
well as other smaller interests in Benelux and French licensees. Generally, the investments in international licensees
are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and carried at cost as we do not exercise significant influence
over these investees. We have received dividends from our investment in the Mexican licensee in the amount of $0.3
million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
