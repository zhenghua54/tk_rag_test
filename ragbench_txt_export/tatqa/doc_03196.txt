During the year ended December 31, 2018, we determined that we would no longer be able to exercise certain ten-year bond forward derivatives within the originally designated time frame. Consequently, we discontinued hedge accounting on those bond forward derivatives and reclassified a $21 million loss from the hedging reserve within shareholders’ equity to finance costs (recorded in “change in fair value of derivative instruments”). We subsequently extended the bond forwards to May 31, 2019, with the ability to extend them further, and redesignated them as effective hedges. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we exercised our remaining bond forwards.
