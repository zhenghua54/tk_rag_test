The Compensation NAV is generally determined by dividing the end of year Compensation NAV per share by the beginning year Compensation NAV per share and subtracting 1 from this amount (the "NAV Return"), and then subtracting the required threshold return rate from the NAV Return. The hurdle rate has consistently been set at 7%, and the plan allows for the share of up to 12% of growth over and above the hurdle rate.
