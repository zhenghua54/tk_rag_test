On November 22, 2019, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). Approximately $43.2 million of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings then outstanding under our ABL and we intend to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions.
