Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $360.8 million, from $7.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $368.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $244.2 million in proceeds from our borrowings, a decrease in bank loan and bond repayments of $165.3 million, an increase of $69.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Partnership’s Series B and Series C Preference Units in 2018 as compared to the issuance of 5,750,000 of its 8.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s Series A Preference Units’’) in 2017 and an increase of
$20.6 million from payments during 2017 for CCS termination. The above movements were partially offset by a decrease of $81.1 million in proceeds from GasLog Partners’ common unit offerings and an increase of $57.0 million in dividend payments.
