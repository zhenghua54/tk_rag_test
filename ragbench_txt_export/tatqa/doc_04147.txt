Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding RSUs.
