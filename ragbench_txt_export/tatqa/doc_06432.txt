Claims receivable mainly represents claims against vesselsâ€™ insurance underwriters in respect of damages arising from accidents or other insured risks, as well as claims under charter contracts including off-hires. While it is anticipated that claims receivable will be recovered within one year, such claims may not all be recovered within one year due to the attendant process of settlement. Nonetheless, amounts are classified as current as they represent amounts currently due to the Company. All amounts are shown net of applicable deductibles.
