Net Pool Allocation: Net pool allocation decreased by $22.1 million, from a positive $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to a negative $4.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net pool allocation was attributable to the movement in the adjustment of the net pool results generated by the GasLog vessels in accordance with the pool distribution formula for the total fleet of the pool, as well as GasLog’s vessels exiting the Cool Pool in June and July 2019. GasLog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of $45.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, from the operation of its vessels in the Cool Pool during the year ended December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: $102.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively).
