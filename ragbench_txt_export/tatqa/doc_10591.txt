In response to the TCJA, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of TCJA. The purpose of SAB 118 was to address any uncertainty or diversity of view in applying ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes in the reporting period in which the TCJA was enacted. SAB 118 addresses situations where the accounting is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the TJCA upon issuance of a company’s financial statements for the reporting period which include the enactment date. SAB 118 allows for a provisional amount to be recorded if it is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the TCJA. Additionally, SAB 118 allows for a measurement period to finalize the impacts of the TCJA, not to extend beyond one year from the date of enactment. For the year ended April 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional decrease in its deferred tax assets and liabilities for the reduction in the federal tax rate with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance. During the year ended April 30, 2019, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA with no material changes to the provisional estimate recorded in prior periods.
