Gross profit and margin decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in hosting migration costs, higher amortization of software development, recognition of previously deferred costs and the sale of OneContent business on April 2, 2018, which carried a higher gross margin compared with our other businesses. These were partially offset with an increase in organic sales for Veradigm and our acute solutions in 2019.
