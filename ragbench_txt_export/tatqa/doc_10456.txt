Free Cash Flow was £54.9m in FY19 compared to £92.4m in FY18, the decrease primarily reflecting the impact of US cash flows. This represents a conversion rate of 36% of Adjusted EBITDA (FY18: 45%). Excluding the US cash flows, Free Cash Flow Conversion increased to 47% from 33% in FY18, driven by improved EBITDA, lower working capital outflows, lower interest costs and lower exceptional cashflows.
