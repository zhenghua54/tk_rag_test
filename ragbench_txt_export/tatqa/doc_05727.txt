Digital Industries achieved its results in a market environment that lost momentum in the course of fiscal 2019. In particular, demand for investment goods eroded notably in the second half of the fiscal year. All regions were impacted by the slowdown, and countries with strong focus on investment goods and strong export ties to China suffered notably. While process industries still benefited from positive development of raw material prices, discrete industries faced headwinds from low demand including destocking effects. The automotive industry was hit by production cuts in Europe and weak demand in China. This, among other factors, also impacted the machine building industry, particularly affecting customers in Germany and Japan.
