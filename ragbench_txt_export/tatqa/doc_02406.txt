BCE net earnings increased by 12.6% in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, mainly due to higher adjusted EBITDA, lower other expense and lower severance, acquisition and other costs. This was partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and finance costs. The adoption of IFRS 16 did not have a significant impact on net earnings.
