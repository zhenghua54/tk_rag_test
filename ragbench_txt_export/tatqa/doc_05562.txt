During 2019, TCE revenues increased by $8,426, or 2.6%, to $335,133 from $326,707 in 2018. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in average daily rates earned by our fleet and decreased spot market exposure. The total number of revenue days decreased from 7,678 days in 2018 to 7,215 days in 2019. The decrease primarily resulted from three fewer vessels in operation during most of 2019 compared to 2018.
