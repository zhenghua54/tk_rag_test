Deferred implementation costs relate to direct and relevant costs on implementation of long-term contracts, to the extent such costs can be recovered through guaranteed contract revenues. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606, deferred implementation costs are no longer capitalized, but rather expensed as incurred as these costs do not relate to future performance obligations. Accordingly, these costs were adjusted through opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 (see note 3 "Revenues").
