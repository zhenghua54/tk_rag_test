Cost of subscription solutions increased $27.2 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher third-party infrastructure and hosting costs. The increase was also due to an increase in costs necessary to support a greater number of merchants using our platform, resulting in an increase in: credit card fees for processing merchant billings, employee-related costs, amortization of technology related to enhancing our platform, payments to third-party partners for the registration of domain names, and payments to third-party theme developers. As a percentage of revenues, costs of subscription solutions decreased from 9.4% in 2018 to 8.1% in 2019 due to a decrease in third-party infrastructure and hosting costs and employee-related costs as a percentage of revenue in 2019.
