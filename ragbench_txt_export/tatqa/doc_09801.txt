Cost of revenues for Online Advertising decreased by 2% to RMB9,241 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower content costs for our advertising-funded long form video service, partly offset by traffic acquisition costs due to revenue growth from our advertising network.
