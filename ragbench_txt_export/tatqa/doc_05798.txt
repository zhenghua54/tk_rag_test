On 28 January 2019, Vodafone announced the commencement of a new irrevocable and non-discretionary share buy-back programme. The sole purpose of the programme was to reduce the issued share capital of Vodafone and thereby avoid any change in Vodafone’s issued share capital as a result of the maturing of the second tranche of the mandatory convertible bond (‘MCB’) in February 2019.
