The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. We continue to obtain, analyze, and interpret guidanceÂ as it is issued and will revise our estimates as additional information becomes available.
