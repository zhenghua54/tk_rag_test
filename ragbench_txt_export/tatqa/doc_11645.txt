Cash includes non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions. Cash equivalents include money market mutual fund accounts, which are invested in government securities. We consider all highly liquid investments that mature three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of our cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to their short maturities and highly liquid nature. Refer to Note 3 for additional information.
