Total expense and other (income) increased 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter with an expense-to-revenue ratio of 32.6 percent compared to 28.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-to-year increase was a result of higher spending (15 points) driven by Red Hat (15 points) and higher acquisitionrelated charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction (4 points), partially offset by higher divestiture gains (3 points) and lower non-operating retirement-related costs (3 points).
