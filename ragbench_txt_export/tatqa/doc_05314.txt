The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) that was recorded in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, the Company reasserted that certain historical undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested which provided a $10.5 million benefit to the effective tax rate. The impact of the changes in the Company's assertion has been included in "Withholding tax on dividends" in the effective income tax reconciliation above. The reduction to the effective tax rate compared to fiscal 2018 was offset by an increase due to the GILTI provisions of Tax Reform in fiscal 2019. The GILTI impact in the table above includes the deduction allowed by the regulations as well as the foreign tax credits attributed to GILTI. The Company has elected to treat the income tax effects of GILTI as a period cost. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 primarily due to expenses related to Tax Reform.
