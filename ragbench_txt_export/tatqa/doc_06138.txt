Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $224.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $39.1 million increase in cash used was a result of (i) an increase in net cash spent at our Insurance segment driven by purchases of investments from the residual cash received from the KIC acquisition and reinsurance recaptures in 2018, (ii) a decrease in cash proceeds received at our Life Sciences segment, from the 2018 upfront payment and 2019 escrow release related to the sale of BeneVir in the prior period, and (iii) an increase in cash used at our Energy segment to acquire ampCNG stations in 2019. These decreases were largely offset by a reduction in cash used by our Construction segment, driven by the acquisition of GrayWolf in 2018, and a reduction in cash used by our Broadcasting segment as less cash was used on its acquisitions in the current year compared to 2018.
