Global Enterprise Global Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers. Global Enterprise revenues decreased $383 million, or 3.4%, during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to declines in traditional data and voice communication services as a result of competitive price pressures. These revenue decreases were partially offset by increases in wireless service revenue.
