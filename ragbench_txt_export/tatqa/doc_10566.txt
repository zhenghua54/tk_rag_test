These increases were further driven by increased wireless equipment revenue resulting from a shift to higher priced units in the mix of wireless devices sold and increases in the number of wireless devices sold, increased revenue related to our wireless device protection package, as well as increased revenue related to Fios services. These revenue increases were partially offset by revenue declines related to the loss of voice and DSL service connections.
