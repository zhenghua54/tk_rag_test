The Company continually reviews the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Due to our recent decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited when evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company was no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable may be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.
