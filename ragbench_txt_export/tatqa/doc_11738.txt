Refrigerated & Frozen operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $479.4 million, an increase of $33.6 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $3.6 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017, driven by continuing increases in input costs and transportation inflation as well as investments to drive distribution, enhanced shelf presence, and trial, partially offset by increased sales volumes and supply chain realized productivity. The acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. of WisconsinÂ® business contributed $4.6 million to gross profit in the segment during fiscal 2018. Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $23.4 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges totaling approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2017 related to a product recall, as well as charges of $0.1 million and $6.2 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
