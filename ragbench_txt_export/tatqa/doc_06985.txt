At December 31, 2019 we had approximately $58.2 million of undistributed earnings and profits. The undistributed earnings and
profits are considered previously taxed income and would not be subject to U.S. income taxes upon repatriation of those earnings, in
the form of dividends. The undistributed earnings and profits are considered to be permanently reinvested, accordingly no provision
for local withholdings taxes have been provided, however, upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends, we could be
subject to additional local withholding taxes.
