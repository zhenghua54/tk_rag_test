The Company incurred $8.8 million in restructuring charges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, including $2.8 million in personnel reduction costs and $6.0 million in relocation and exit costs. The personnel reduction costs of $2.8 million were primarily due to $0.9 million in costs related to headcount reductions in the TOKIN legacy group across various internal and operational functions, $0.3 million in severance charges related to personnel reductions in the Film and Electrolytic reportable segment resulting from a reorganization of the segment's management structure, and $1.6 million in costs related to reorganization in the Solid Capacitors reportable segment due to a permanent structural change driven by a decline of MnO2 products. The relocation and exit costs of $6.0 million were primarily due to $3.4 million in costs related to the Company's relocation of its tantalum powder equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its plant in Matamoros, Mexico and $2.3 million in costs related to the relocation of axial electrolytic production equipment from Granna, Sweden to its plant in Evora, Portugal.
