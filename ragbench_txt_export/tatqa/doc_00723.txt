SaaS revenue was $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $7.2 million, or 10.9%, from $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was due to a $4.0 million increase from Eviti platform solutions related to the combination of new customers and increased covered lives on existing customers and a $3.2 million increase in NaviNet SaaS revenue, largely from the higher value of professional services projects being completed in 2019.
