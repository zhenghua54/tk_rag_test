Any Free Shares awarded under the SIP will be held in trust on behalf of each employee for at least three years following grant, after which time they may be withdrawn, provided the individual employee has remained in employment with the Company. If the Free Shares are held in trust for a further two years, they will qualify for HMRC-approved tax advantages.
