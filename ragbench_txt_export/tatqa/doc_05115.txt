Similar to its peers, the Company monitors its capital based on debt to capital ratio. The ratio is calculated as the Companyâ€™s net debt divided by its total capital. The net debt is derived by taking the total liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets minus cash and cash equivalents. The total capital consists of total equity (including capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, other components of equity and non-controlling interests) plus net debt.
