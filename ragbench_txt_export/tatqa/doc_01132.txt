Operating Activities: For 2019, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included a $2.43 billion decrease in receivables due to a lower level of net sales and a $1.53 billion increase in inventory due to higher levels of work in process and raw materials inventories.
