Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive shares of common stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock were the same for all periods presented as the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive. The Company uses the if converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect on diluted loss per share.
