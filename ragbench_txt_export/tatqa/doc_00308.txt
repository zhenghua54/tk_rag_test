Provisions for post-employment benefits plans consist of commitments primarily related to benefits defined by the provisions of company pension plans. These take the form of defined benefit plans directly from the employer (employer’s commitments) and defined benefit plans from external pension providers (benevolent funds in Germany and international pension funds). The external providers’ assets serve exclusively to finance the pension entitlements and qualify as plan assets. The benefits under the different plans are based on performance and length of service.
