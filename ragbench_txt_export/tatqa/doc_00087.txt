Deferred revenue relates to performance obligations for which payments have been received by the customer prior to revenue recognition. Deferred revenue primarily consists of deferred software, or amounts allocated to mobile dashboard and on-line apps and unspecified upgrade rights. Deferred revenue also includes deferred subscription-based services. The deferred software and deferred subscription-based service performance obligations are anticipated to be recognized over the useful life or service periods of one to eighteen months.
