Total expense and other (income) increased 2.8 percent in 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat operational spending and investments in software and systems innovation, higher interest expense, non-operating acquisition-related activity associated with the Red Hat transaction and lower IP income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs, divesture-related activity (gains on divestitures and lower spending) and the effects of currency. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 4.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating acquisition related activity and lower non-operating retirement-related costs described above.
