During fiscal 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our International reporting segment totaling $198.9 million, of which $139.2 million related to our Canadian reporting unit and $59.7 million related to our Mexican reporting unit. These impairment charges resulted from a change in reporting segments, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level, and from further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits during fiscal 2017, which were caused primarily by changes in foreign exchange rates.
