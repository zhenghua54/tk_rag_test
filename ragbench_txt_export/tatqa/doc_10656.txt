In fiscal year 2019, our Data Center market revenue decreased by $48.0 million, or 29.6%, compared to fiscal year 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue related to sales of legacy optical products and lasers, partially offset by the recognition of $7.0 million of licensing revenue during the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019.
