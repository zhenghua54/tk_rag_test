During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-18-Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The standard has been applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
