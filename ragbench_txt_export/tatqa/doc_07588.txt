Net unrealized and realized (losses)/gains on interest rate swap agreements: As of December 31, 2019, we have an interest rate swap portfolio with a notional amount of $737.5 million, none of which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Net unrealized losses on the interest rate swaps increased to a loss of $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $0.6 million for the same period in 2018, due to a decline in the long-term swap rates, partially offset by the decreased notional value of our swap portfolio over the period. Realized gains on our interest rate swaps decreased to a gain of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a gain of $8.1 million for the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates for the year ended December 31, 2019.
