(4) For purposes of these grants, we determined both the number of time-vested and performance-based restricted shares or RSUs by dividing the total grant value granted to the executive by the volume-weighted average closing price of a share of our common stock over the 15-trading-day period ending five trading days prior to the grant date (“VWAP”), rounding to the nearest whole share. However, as noted previously, for purposes of reporting these awards in the Summary Compensation Table, our shares of time-vested restricted stock or RSUs are valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and our shares of performance-based restricted stock or RSUs are valued as of the grant date based on probable outcomes, as required by applicable accounting and SEC disclosure rules. See footnote 2 to the Summary Compensation Table for more information.
