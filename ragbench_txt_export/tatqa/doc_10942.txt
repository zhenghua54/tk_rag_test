(iv) Charterhire expenses - This consists of the charterhire expenses that we incurred for the charter back from Golar Partners of the Golar Grand. In connection with the sale of the Golar Grand to Golar Partners in November 2012, we issued an option where, in the event that the charterer did not renew or extend its charter for the Golar Grand beyond February 2015, the Partnership had the option to require us to charter the vessel through to October 2017. In February 2015, the option was exercised. Accordingly, we recognized charterhire costs of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, in relation to the Golar Grand.
