Net realized and unrealized gains on investments: Net realized and unrealized gains on investments from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $3.7 million to $1.9 million from $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by smaller realized gains on bonds and common stocks, higher impairments, and losses on fair value changes on interest only bonds in 2019. The decrease was offset by overall improvement in fair value changes in equity securities and realized gains on mortgage loans in 2019.
