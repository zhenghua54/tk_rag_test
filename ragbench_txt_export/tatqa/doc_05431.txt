Deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced and for which the Company has the right to bill, but that have not been recognized as revenue because the related goods or services have not been transferred. Deferred revenue that will be realized during the 12-month period following the date of the consolidated balance sheets is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current.
