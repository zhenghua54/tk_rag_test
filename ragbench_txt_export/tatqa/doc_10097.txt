Upon entering into the definitive agreement, which we consider a level 2 observable input in the fair value hierarchy, we assessed the carrying value of the SubCom business and determined that it was in excess of its fair value. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million, which was included in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of the business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
