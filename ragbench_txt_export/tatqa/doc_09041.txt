Prior to the adoption of the new standard, the Company recognized substantially all of its revenue from contracts with customers at a point in time, which was generally when the goods were shipped to or received by the customer, title and risk of ownership had passed, the price to the buyer was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). Under the new standard, the Company recognizes revenue over time for the majority of its contracts with customers which results in revenue for those customers being recognized earlier than under the previous guidance. Revenue for all other contracts with customers continues to be recognized at a point in time, similar to recognition prior to the adoption of the standard.
