Revenues from VAS increased by 20% to RMB52,308 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 on a year-on-year basis. Online games revenues grew by 25% to RMB30,286 million. The increase was primarily driven by revenue growth from smart phone games in both domestic and overseas markets, including titles such as Peacekeeper Elite and PUBG Mobile, as well as revenue contributions from Supercell titles, partly offset by lower revenues from PC client games such as DnF. Social networks revenues increased by 13% to RMB22,022 million. The increase mainly reflected greater contributions from digital content services such as live broadcast and music streaming services. Total smart phone games revenues (including smart phone games revenues attributable to our social networks business) were RMB26,035 million and PC client games revenues were RMB10,359 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
