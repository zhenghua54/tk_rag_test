Adjusteda revenue decline of 4% for the year was driven by regulated price reductions predominantly on FTTC and Ethernet products, non-regulated price reductions (mainly driven by communications providers signing up for fibre volume discounts), a small decline in our physical line base and a reclassification of costs to revenue. This was partly offset by 25% growth in our fibre rental base, a 9% increase in our Ethernet rental base and the impact of adopting IFRS 15.
