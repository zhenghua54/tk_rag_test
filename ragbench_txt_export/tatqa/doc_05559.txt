Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into US Dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to US Dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. Historically, the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Chinese Renminbi.
