Sales: CGD sales decreased 10% to $325.2 million in 2018 compared to $360.2 million in 2017. The year-over-year comparative sales and operating income were significantly impacted by an $8.0 million gain recognized on an equitable contract adjustment in fiscal 2017 for our littoral combat ship virtual training contract with the U.S. Navy. Sales were lower in fiscal 2018 on virtual training sales, air combat training system sales, and ground combat training system sales, while sales of international training support services increased between fiscal 2017 and 2018. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar had no significant impact on CGD sales between 2017 and 2018.
