Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 due to lower hardware products revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower hardware support revenues. The decrease in hardware products revenues in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. This constant currency hardware revenue decrease was partially offset by certain hardware revenue increases related to our Oracle Engineered Systems offerings, primarily Oracle Exadata.
