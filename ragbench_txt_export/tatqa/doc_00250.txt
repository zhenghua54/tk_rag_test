Share of (loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures. We recorded share of losses of associates and joint ventures of RMB1,328 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to share of profit of RMB16 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The change was mainly due to share of losses arising from non-cash fair value changes of investment portfolios booked by certain associates in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to share of profit recorded in the same quarter last year.
