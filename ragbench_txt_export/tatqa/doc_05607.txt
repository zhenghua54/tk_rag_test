Basic EPS is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Our outstanding convertible preferred stocks are considered participating securities as the holders may participate in undistributed earnings with holders of common shares and are not obligated to share in our net losses.
