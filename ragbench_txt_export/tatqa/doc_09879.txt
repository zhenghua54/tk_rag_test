At December 31, 2019, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating losses of approximately $256.8 million, $275.5 million, and $89.7 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2022, the state net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2020, and the foreign net operating loss has an unlimited carryforward period. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an “ownership change” of a corporation. Accordingly, a company’s ability to use net operating losses may be limited as prescribed under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“IRC Section 382”). Events which may cause limitations in the amount of the net operating losses that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. Due to the effects of historical equity issuances, the Company has determined that the future utilization of a portion of its net operating losses is limited annually pursuant to IRC Section 382. The Company has determined that none of its net operating losses will expire because of the annual limitation.
