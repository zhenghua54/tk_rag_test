In fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The definitive agreement provided that, if the purchaser sells the business within two years of the closing date, we will be entitled to 20% of the net proceeds of that future sale, as defined in the agreement, in excess of $325 million. The sale of the SubCom business, which was previously included in our Communications Solutions segment, represents our exit from the telecommunications market and was significant to our sales and profitability, both to the Communications Solutions segment and to the consolidated company. We concluded that the divestiture was a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and has been reported as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
