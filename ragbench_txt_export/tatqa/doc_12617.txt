Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $13.0 million to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in intangible asset amortization of $8.9 million as certain assets reached the end of their useful lives, as well as decreases in payroll-related expense of $1.7 million due to lower headcount, professional fees of $1.3 million, outside services of $0.5 million, and travel-related expenses of $0.3 million.
