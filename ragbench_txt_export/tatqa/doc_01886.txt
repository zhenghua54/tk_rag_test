Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for rental income, goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Loans and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
