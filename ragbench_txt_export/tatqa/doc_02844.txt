The valuation allowance was $1.3 billion at each of May 31, 2019 and 2018. Substantially all of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.
