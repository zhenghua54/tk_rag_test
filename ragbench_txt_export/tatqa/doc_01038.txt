We recognize interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest and penalties recorded were $13.1 million, negligible and $4.0 million, respectively in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We had gross liabilities, for interest and penalties, of $56.2 million at December 31, 2019, $18.2 million at December 31, 2018 and $14.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in the gross liability related to interest and penalties from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a reclass within other non-current liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits to interest and penalties which had no impact on the overall Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statement of Operations.
