Per the terms of the merger agreement, unvested stock options held by WebLife employees were canceled and exchanged for the Company’s unvested awards. The fair value of $333 of these unvested options was attributed to pre-combination service and included in consideration transferred. The fair value of $1,468 was allocated to post-combination services. The unvested awards are subject to the recipient’s continued service with the Company, and $1,468 is recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the required remaining service period. Also, as part of the merger agreement, 107 shares of the Company’s common stock were deferred for certain key employees with the total fair value of $9,652 (see Note 11 “Equity Award Plans”), which was not included in the purchase price. The deferred shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and their fair value is expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining period.
