Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $5.6 million to $25.8 million from $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher disposition costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of the Marine Services segment. This was partially offset by a reversal of an accrual of bad debt expense in the current period due to a favorable receivable settlement during the quarter. See Note 24. Subsequent Events for the summary of the subsequent events.
