Upfront fee revenue is recognised on a net basis of the historical percentage of ‘referred’ sales expected to become ‘financial’ and that do not trigger a ‘clawback’. These estimates are adjusted to actual percentages experienced at each reporting date. As such, the Group determines its revenue by estimating variable consideration and applying the constraint by utilising industry data and historical experience (refer to note 3.6 for further information).
