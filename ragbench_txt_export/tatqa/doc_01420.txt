In July 2017, we acquired Deltenna, a wireless infrastructure company specializing in the design and delivery of radio and antenna communication solutions. Deltenna’s operations were included in our CGD reporting unit upon its acquisition. On April 1, 2019, we reorganized our reporting structure to include Deltenna in our CMS reporting unit and reassigned $3.4 million of goodwill from CGD to CMS based upon its relative fair value. Since its acquisition, Deltenna’s sales, operating results, and cash flows have not been significant to our consolidated results. As such, reportable segment information has not been restated for this change in the composition of our reportable segments.
