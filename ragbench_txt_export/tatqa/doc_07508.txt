* In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that clarifies that in a classified statement of financial position, an entity shall classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent amounts. This guidance superseded ASC 740-10-45-5 which required the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction be allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that tax jurisdiction on a pro rata basis. We elected to early adopt the standard retrospectively in fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets to non-current deferred income tax assets and non-current deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
