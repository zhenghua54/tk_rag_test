During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted in the United States. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118) that directed taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as “provisional” when it did not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.
