The gas turbine market is experiencing overcapacity among OEMs and EPC contractors, which is fostering market consolidation. In the market for large steam turbines for power generation, volume shrank further year-over-year from an already low basis of comparison due to an ongoing shift from coal-fired to gas-fired and renewable power generation, as well as to carbon emission regulation. We expect these developments to continue in fiscal 2020. In contrast, markets for industrial steam turbines were stable in fiscal 2019, and the market segment is expected to be flat in fiscal 2020.
