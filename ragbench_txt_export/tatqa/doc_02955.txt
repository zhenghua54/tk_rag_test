n January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent other changes in fair value recognized in net income. The guidance also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, our fiscal 2019. It should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, unless equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values, in which case the amendments should be applied prospectively. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We did not use prospective amendments for any investments and adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
