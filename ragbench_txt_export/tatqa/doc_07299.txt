The initial fair value liability of the embedded cash conversion option was $82.8 million, which simultaneously reduced the carrying value of the 1.25% Notes (effectively an original issuance discount). The embedded cash conversion option is measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For further discussion of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the embedded cash conversion option, refer to Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.”
