The Groupâ€™s investments in listed equity securities are designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Investments are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and, in subsequent periods, are measured at fair value with any change recognised in other comprehensive income. Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained earnings.
