Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
