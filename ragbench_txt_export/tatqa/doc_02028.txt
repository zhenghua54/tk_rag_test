Gas and
Power ’s revenue decreased moderately year-over-year in a continuing
difficult market environment as the new-unit businesses recorded lower revenue compared to fiscal 2018 following weak order entry in prior years. On a geographic basis, revenue decreased in the regions Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East and Asia, Australia, partly offset by growth in the Americas.

In addition, Adjusted EBITA in fiscal 2018 benefited from gains totaling € 166 million from two divestments. Severance charges were € 242 million in fiscal 2019 compared to € 374 million in fiscal 2018.
