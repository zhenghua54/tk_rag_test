Bell Wireline operating revenues remained unchanged in Q4 2019, compared to Q4 2018, resulting from stable year-over-year service revenue which increased 0.1%, as the continued expansion of our retail Internet and IPTV subscriber bases, residential rate increases, contribution from the federal election and higher business solution services revenue were offset by ongoing subscriber erosion in voice and satellite TV, greater acquisition, retention and bundle discounts on residential services to match competitor promotions, lower TV pay-per-view revenues and a decline in IP connectivity revenues due in part to migration to Internet based services. Product revenues were relatively stable year over year, declining 0.6% or $1 million.
