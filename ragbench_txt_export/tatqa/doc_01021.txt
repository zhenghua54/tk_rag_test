As of December 31, 2019, the Company has accumulated federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $165.0 million and $134.3 million, respectively. Of the $165.0 million of federal NOL carryforwards, $57.9 million was generated before January 1, 2018 and is subject to the 20-year carryforward period (“pre-Tax Act losses”). The remaining $107.1 million (“post-Tax Act losses”) can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. The pre-Tax Act U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through 2037. The Company completed a Section 382 study for the period through March 31, 2019 and determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred on December 31, 2017 subjecting all pre-Tax Act losses to a utilization limitation; however, such limitation is not expected to result in NOLs expiring unused. Any future annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs before utilization.
