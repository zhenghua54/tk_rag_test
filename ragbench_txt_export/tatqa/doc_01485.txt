Working Capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital decreased $0.4 million to $12.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared with $12.7 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase of cash, accounts receivable, and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and current operating lease liabilities.
