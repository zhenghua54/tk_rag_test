Cash provided by (used in) operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.9 million during 2018 compared to $43.8 million cash used in operating activities during 2017. The $113.8 million change was primarily driven by $99.6 million increase in net income (loss), from $45.3 million net loss for 2017 to $54.3 million net income for 2018 and $27.0 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by $7.0 million increase in other assets, $4.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $3.7 million decrease in accounts payable. The increases in deferred revenue and other non-current assets primarily reflected the effect of the adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities was also affected by an increase in non-cash charges of $2.6 million primarily related to higher stock-based compensation expense incurred for 2018 compared to 2017.
