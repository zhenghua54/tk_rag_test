General and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related benefits of $4.1 million and an increase in other miscellaneous expenses of $2.2 million, which includes professional fees such as legal, audit and tax related expenses. These were partially offset by a reduction in the use of facility and related expenses of $4.5 million. The remainder of the change was attributable to other activities associated with normal growth in our business operations. Overall, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained at approximately 7%.
