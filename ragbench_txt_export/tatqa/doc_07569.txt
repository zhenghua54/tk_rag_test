Provision for income taxes reflects the tax provision on our operations in foreign and U.S. jurisdictions, offset by tax benefits from a partial release of valuation allowance against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets ("DTAs") and from lapsing of statute of limitations related to uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions. As of December 28, 2019, we maintain a valuation allowance of $36.6 million primarily against our California deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits, due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets.
