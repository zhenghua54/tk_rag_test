As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company also offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a Partnership share scheme, under which employees can invest up to Â£1,800 of pre-tax salary (or, if less, 10 per cent of salary) in any tax year, which will be used to purchase ordinary shares in the Company (Partnership Shares) at the end of a 12-month period. The Group will give each employee one ordinary share (a Matching Share) for every two Partnership Shares purchased by the employee. Matching Shares will be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group within three years of the date of award and will qualify for HMRC-approved tax advantages if they are held in the SIP for five years.
