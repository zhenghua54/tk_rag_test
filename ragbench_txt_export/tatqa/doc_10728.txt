This programme has now completed and the Group does not expect to incur any further restructuring costs associated with this programme. Advisory fees associated with strategic reviews and corporate activity were also included in restructuring costs in the year. Other non-trading items of £1.9m refer to a past service pension credit of £3.9m due to inflation increases no longer required in a smaller Irish pension scheme, partly offset by costs related to the departure of previous CEO Gavin Darby.
