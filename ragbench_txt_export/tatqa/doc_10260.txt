As of April 26, 2019, we had $296 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $252 million has been recorded in other long-term liabilities. Unrecognized tax benefits of $246 million, including penalties, interest and indirect benefits, would affect our provision for income taxes if recognized. As a result of U.S. tax reform, we recorded provisional gross unrecognized tax benefits of $114 million during fiscal 2018.
