Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 primarily related to $30.0 million of principal payments made towards the repayment of our term loan and $8.0 million related to tax withholdings associated with the net share settlements of our equity awards, largely offset by $23.4 million of proceeds from a term loan to fund the acquisition of FRT and $8.1 million of proceeds received from issuances of common stock under our stock incentive plans.
