We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Ireland, and Singapore. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our fiscal years 2014 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes. Our fiscal years prior to 2014 have been settled and closed with the IRS. Our 2015 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes, and our 2014 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Singapore tax purposes.
