Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, and financial assets which are specifically exempt from this measurement requirement.
