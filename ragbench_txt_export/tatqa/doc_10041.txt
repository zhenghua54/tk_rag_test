(5) The Company defines return on invested capital ("ROIC"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents, as discussed in Part II, Item 7, "Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return." For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared in accordance with GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K.
