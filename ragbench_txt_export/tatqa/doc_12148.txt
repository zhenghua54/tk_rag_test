A deferred tax liability at 30 March 2019 of £13.5m compared to a liability of £12.1m at 31 March 2018. This movement is primarily due to a slightly higher pensions surplus reported at 30 March 2019 compared to 31 March 2018 reflecting the allowability for tax on pensions contribution payments. Recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to brought forward losses were approximately £44m at 30 March 2019 and equate to around £250m of future taxable profits.
