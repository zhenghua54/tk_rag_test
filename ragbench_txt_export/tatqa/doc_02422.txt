BCE cash flows from operating activities was $2,091 million in Q4 2019 compared to $1,788 million in Q4 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to higher adjusted EBITDA, which reflects the favourable impact from the adoption of IFRS 16, a voluntary DB pension plan contribution of nil in 2019 compared to $240 million paid in 2018, an increase in operating assets and liabilities, and lower interest paid, partly offset by higher income taxes paid.
