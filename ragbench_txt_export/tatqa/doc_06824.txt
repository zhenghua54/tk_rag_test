In fiscal year 2019, the Company spent considerable resources, with a partner, to bring a new suite of public safety products to market. When compared to our current public safety repeaters, these products would include additional capacities, frequency ranges, features, and channelization that would significantly expand our offering to a larger public safety addressable market. We continue to work with our partner on product testing and delivery time frames and, if successful, we would expect future revenue growth in this market.
