The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Directorâ€™s best estimate, taking into account the effects of exercise restrictions, non-transferability and behavioural considerations. An increase in the expected life will increase the estimated fair value.
