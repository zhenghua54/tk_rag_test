Our fourth quarter 2019 net revenues amounted to $2,754 million, registering a sequential increase of 7.9%, 290 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance, with all product groups contributing to the growth. The sequential increase resulted from higher volumes of approximately 7% and an increase of approximately 1% in average selling prices, the latter entirely due to product mix, while selling prices remained substantially stable.
