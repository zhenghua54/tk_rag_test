We have operating leases for office space, automobiles and various other equipment in the U.S. and in certain international locations. We also reviewed other contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, for potential embedded leases. We specifically reviewed these other contracts to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease.
