On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (GILTI) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries. Consistent with accounting guidance, we have elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any net deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiaries in connection with the Tax Act.
