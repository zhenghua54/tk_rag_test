Operating revenues. Operating revenues decreased by 2.0% from NT$151,253 million in 2018 to NT$148,202 million (US$4,955 million) in
2019, primarily due to decreased other operating revenues, decreased foundry wafer sale, and 2.5% depreciation of the NTD in 2019 from 2018. The decreased foundry wafer sale came from a decline of 2.9% in average selling price from 2018 to 2019, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in foundry wafer shipment from 7,108 thousand 8-inch equivalent wafers in 2018 to 7,189 thousand 8-inch equivalent wafers in 2019.
