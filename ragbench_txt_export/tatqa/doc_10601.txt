BCE’s operating lease commitments at December 31, 2018 were $1,612 million. The difference between operating lease commitments at December 31, 2018 and lease liabilities of $2,304 million upon adoption of IFRS 16 at January 1, 2019, is due mainly to an increase of $1,122 million related to renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised, an increase of $112 million mainly related to non-monetary transactions and a decrease of ($542) million as a result of discounting applied to future lease payments, which was determined using a weighted average incremental borrowing rate of 3.49% at January 1, 2019.
