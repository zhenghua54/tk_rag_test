At February 28, 2019, we increased the uncertain tax benefits related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Such deferred tax assets were previously offset by a valuation allowance so that the increase in the unrecognized tax benefit coupled with the reduction of the valuation allowance on such net operating losses did not result in an income tax expense during the current fiscal year. If total uncertain tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $3.2 million. As of February 28, 2019, our liabilities for uncertain tax benefits were netted against our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. It is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced within the next 12 months by at least $0.6 million.
