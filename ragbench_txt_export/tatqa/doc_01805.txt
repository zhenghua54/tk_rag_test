Net cash used in investing activities increased $43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business, partially offset by $40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note.
