The Group leases retail premises and warehousing facilities which are generally for periods up to 40 years. The operating lease commitments include leases for the Norwest office and distribution centres. Generally the lease agreements are for initial terms of between five and 25 years and most include multiple renewal options for additional five to 10-year terms. Under most leases, the Group is responsible for property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and expenses related to the leased properties. However, many of the more recent lease agreements have been negotiated on a gross or semi-gross basis, which eliminates or significantly reduces the Groupâ€™s exposure to operational charges associated with the properties.
