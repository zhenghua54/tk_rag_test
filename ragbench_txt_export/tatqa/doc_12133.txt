The following table sets forth our 60-month backlog estimate, by reportable segment, as of December 31, 2019; September 30, 2019; June 30, 2019; March 31, 2019; and December 31, 2018 (in millions). The 60-month backlog estimate includes approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the acquisition of Speedpay, which occurred on May 9, 2019. Dollar amounts reflect foreign currency exchange rates as of each period end. This is a non-GAAP financial measure being presented to provide comparability across accounting periods. We believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our financial performance.
