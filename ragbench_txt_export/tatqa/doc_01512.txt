Electronic Component sales were $1,290.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 compared to $1,235.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
The sales increase in Electronic Components product sales was driven by increased volume and a favorable pricing environment in our Ceramic and Tantalum
Components across most markets resulting from favorable global market conditions and increased demand for our electronic component products resulting from
technological advances across a broad range of industries driven by IoT and an increasingly connected world led by the automotive, industrial, telecommunications,
networking, and computer markets. Fiscal year 2019 Advanced Components group sales include $113.3 million of Ethertronics product as compared to $12.7 million for
fiscal year 2018. These increases were partially offset by the loss of Kyocera resale product sales which were $19.0 million for fiscal year 2019 as compared to $296.3
million for fiscal year 2018.
