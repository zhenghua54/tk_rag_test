Our redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to our 85% equity ownership interest in OpenEye. The OpenEye stockholder agreement contains a put option that gives the minority OpenEye stockholders the right to sell their OpenEye shares to us based on the fair value of the shares. The OpenEye stockholder agreement also contains a call option that gives us the right to purchase the remaining OpenEye shares from the minority OpenEye stockholders based on the fair value of the shares. The put and call options can each be exercised beginning in the first quarter of 2023. This redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered temporary equity and we report it between liabilities and stockholdersâ€™ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the net income or loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
