Expense under Tundra Letter Agreement - In May 2016, we completed the Golar Tundra Sale and received a total cash consideration of $107.2 million. We agreed to pay Golar Partners a daily fee plus operating expenses for the right to use the Golar Tundra from the date the Golar Tundra Sale was closed, until the date that the vessel would commence operations under the Golar Tundra Time Charter. In return, Golar Partners agreed to remit to us any hire income received with respect to the Golar Tundra during that period. We have accounted for $nil, $nil and $2.2 million as interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
