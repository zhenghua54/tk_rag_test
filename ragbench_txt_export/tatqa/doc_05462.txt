Our operating activities used approximately $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with approximately $0.8 million provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018. The cash provided in 2018 was the result of our net income and non-cash expenses, partially offset by the increased working capital required to support higher revenues. The cash used in operations in 2019 was the result of increased levels of working capital required to support higher revenue levels, expenditures related to growth, and costs associated with our acquisition in 2019.
