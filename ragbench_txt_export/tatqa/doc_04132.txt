During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, Autodesk granted 2.1 million restricted stock units. Restricted stock units
vest over periods ranging from immediately upon grant to a pre-determined date that is typically within three years from the
date of grant. Restricted stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are
not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. The fair value of the restricted stock units is expensed
ratably over the vesting period. Autodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units of $189.3
million, $202.1 million, and $173.0 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of
January 31, 2019, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $364.5 million related to non-vested awards is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.76 years. At January 31, 2019, the number of restricted stock units granted but
unvested was 3.9 million.
