Constant underlying earnings per share (constant underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholdersâ€™ equity at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of both translational hedges and price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies divided by the diluted average number of ordinary share units. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each ordinary share unit of the Group in constant exchange rates.
