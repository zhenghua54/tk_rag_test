The Group has elected to account for trail commission revenue at the time of selling a product to which trail commission attaches, rather than on the basis of actual payments received from the relevant fund or providers involved. On initial recognition, trail commission revenue and assets are recognised at expected value. Subsequent to initial recognition and measurement, the carrying amount of the trail commission asset is adjusted to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The resulting adjustment is recognised as revenue or against revenue in profit or loss.
