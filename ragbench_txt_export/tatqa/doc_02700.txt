TELEPHONY Fiscal 2019 telephony service customers net losses amounted to 23,333 compared to 32,987 for the prior year mainly due to: • technical issues with telephony activations following the implementation of the new customer management system which were resolved at the end of the first quarter; • increasing wireless penetration in North America and various unlimited offers launched by wireless operators causing some customers to cancel their landline telephony services for wireless telephony services only; partly offset by • growth in the business sector; and • more telephony bundles due to additional promotional activity in the second half of fiscal 2019.
