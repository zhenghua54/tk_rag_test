Net investment income: Net investment income from our Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $95.8 million to $212.9 million from $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the income generated from the assets acquired in the KIC acquisition, higher average invested assets as a result of the reinvestment of premiums and investment income received, and to a lesser extent, rotation into higher-yielding investments.
