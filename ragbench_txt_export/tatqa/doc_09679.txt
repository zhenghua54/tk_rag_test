OPERATING EXPENSES Fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 19.5% (15.2% in constant currency) mainly as a result of: • the impact of the MetroCast acquisition which was included in operating expenses for only an eight-month period in the prior year; • programming rate increases; • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; • higher compensation expenses due to higher headcount to support growth; and • higher marketing initiatives to drive primary service units growth; partly offset by • the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million (US$2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma.
