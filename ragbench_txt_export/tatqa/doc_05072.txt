Due to the Tax Act, U.S. net operating losses ("NOLs") arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 will no longer be subject to the limited 20-year carryforward period. Under the new law, these NOLs carry forward indefinitely, resulting in the creation of indefinite-lived deferred tax assets. Consequently, as the Company schedules its deferred taxes and considers the ability to realize its deferred tax assets in future periods, it needs to consider how existing deferred tax assets, other than historical NOLs, will reverse.
