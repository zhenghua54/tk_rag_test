In fiscal 2018, the Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis on its reporting units. Based on the qualitative analysis performed during the Company's annual impairment evaluation for fiscal 2018 for certain of its reporting units, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting unit carrying values, and as a result, a quantitative step one analysis was not necessary.
