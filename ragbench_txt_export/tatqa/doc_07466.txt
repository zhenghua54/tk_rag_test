In applying the two-class method, we determined that undistributed earnings should be allocated equally on a per share basis between Class A and Class B common stock. Under our Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of the common stock are entitled to participate ratably, on a share-for-share basis as if all shares of common stock were of a single class, in such dividends, as may be declared by the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we declared and paid quarterly dividends, in the amount of $0.27, $0.25 and $0.21 per share on both classes of common stock.
