Unbilled receivables consist of amounts where we have satisfied our contractual obligations related to inventory stocking contracts with customers. Such amounts are typically invoiced to the customer upon their consumption of the inventory managed under the stocking contracts. We anticipate that substantially all unbilled receivables will be invoiced and collected over the next twelve months. These contracts do not include any financing components.
