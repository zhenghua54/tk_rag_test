Base Salary. The base salary for each NEO is determined on the basis of the following factors: scope of responsibilities, experience, skills, performance, expected future contribution, base salary levels in effect for comparable positions at the companies in the Peer Group (as described on page 42 below under “Use of Peer Group Compensation Data”) and other competitive market factors. Generally, the Committee reviews the base salary levels of our NEOs annually as part of the Company’s performance review process as well as upon a promotion or other change of position or level of responsibility. Merit-based increases to the base salaries of our NEOs (other than our CEO) are recommended by our CEO to the Committee, and all increases are based on the Committee’s (and in the case of our CEO, the Board’s) review and assessment of the factors described above.
