Orders related to external customers were clearly up year-overyear on growth in nearly all industrial businesses, led by Mobility. Gas and Power, Siemens Healthineers, Smart Infrastructure and SGRE all posted clear growth, while orders declined slightly in Digital Industries. Volume from large orders for Industrial Businesses overall was up substantially due to a sharp increase at Mobility, but also due to a significant increase in SGRE and Gas and Power. Growth in emerging markets was driven by orders from China, and from Russia where Mobility won a â‚¬ 1.2 billion contract for high-speed trains including maintenance.
