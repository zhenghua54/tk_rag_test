Net cash provided by operating activities increased $242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes, integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. This was partially offset by $24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business ("IS&GS Business").
