The net income tax benefit of $1,222 million related primarily to the recognition of certain non-U.S. loss carryforwards and basis differences in subsidiaries expected to be utilized against future taxable income, partially offset by a $46 million increase in the valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.
