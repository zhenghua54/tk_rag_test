Retail Channel Net Revenues The decrease in net revenues from retail channels for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to: • lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, which was released in October 2018, as compared to Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017; • lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise; and • lower revenues from Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane Trilogy, which was released on the Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch in June 2018.
