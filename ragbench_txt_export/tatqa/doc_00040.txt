Gross profit in fiscal year 2019 increased to $444.8 million, or 18.7 percent of net sales from $382.3 million, or 17.7 percent of net sales for fiscal year 2018. Excluding the impact of the surcharge revenue, our gross margin in fiscal year 2019 was 22.9 percent compared to 21.3 percent in fiscal year 2018. The results reflect the impact of improved product mix coupled with capacity gains and operating cost reductions compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal year 2019 also reflects an $11.4 million benefit related to an insurance recovery in our third fiscal quarter.
