Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”). Our SG&A expenses, including non-cash equity- based compensation expense, increased 4.6% from 2017 to 2018. Non cash equity-based compensation expense is included in SG&A expenses consistent with the classification of the employee's salary and other compensation and was $16.8 million for 2018 and $12.7 million for 2017. SG&A expenses increased primarily from an increase in salaries and related costs required to support our expansion and increases in our sales efforts and an increase in our headcount partly offset by a $1.1 million decrease in our legal fees primarily associated with U.S. net neutrality and interconnection regulatory matters and by the $1.3 million reduction in commission expense from the impact of the new revenue accounting standard which requires us to capitalize certain commissions paid to our sales agents and sales employees. Our sales force headcount increased by 7.8% from 574 at December 31, 2017 to 619 at December 31, 2018 and our total headcount increased by 4.8% from 929 at December 31, 2017 to 974 at December 31, 2018.
