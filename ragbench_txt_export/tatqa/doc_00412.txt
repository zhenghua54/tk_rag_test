In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 will not be realizable. Accordingly, management has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $1,816.
