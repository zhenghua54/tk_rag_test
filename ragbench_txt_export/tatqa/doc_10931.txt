Net revenue in Connected Home segment decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. Net revenue from service provider customers fell $27.8 million compared with the prior year. In addition, the North American home WiFi market contracted in fiscal 2019 affecting net revenue from non-service provider customers. The lower revenue was primarily due to declined net revenue of our home wireless, mobile and broadband modem and gateway products. Within home wireless, we experienced declines in net revenue from AC router products, WiFi mesh systems and extenders, partially offset by net revenue generated from the introduction of WiFi 6 routers. On a geographic basis, we experience net revenue declines across all three regions.
