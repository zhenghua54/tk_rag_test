During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a one-time PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contained performance conditions and would have vested at the end of a three-year period if such performance conditions were met. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. These awards were forfeited during the first quarter of 2020 as the performance conditions were not achieved.
