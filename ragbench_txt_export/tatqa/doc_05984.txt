During the year ended December 31, 2019, pursuant to the 2016 Incentive Plan, the Company granted restricted share unit awards (“RSUs”). RSUs generally have requisite service periods of three years and vest in increments of 33% on the anniversary of the grant dates. RSUs granted to our board vest one year from grant or as of the next annual shareholders meeting, whichever is earlier. Under each arrangement, RSUs are issued without direct cost to the employee on the vesting date. The Company estimates the fair value of the RSUs based upon the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
