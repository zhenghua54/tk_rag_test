The difference in the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenues primarily results from the timing difference between our performance and the customerâ€™s payments. We fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we reclassified $19.2 million of contract assets to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional. During the year ended June 30, 2019, there was no significant impairment loss recognized related to contract assets.
