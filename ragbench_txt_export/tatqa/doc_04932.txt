In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 â€“ Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective method, with prospective adoption for amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
