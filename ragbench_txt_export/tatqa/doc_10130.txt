As of December 31, 2019, the Company determined that a total valuation allowance of $36.3 was necessary to reduce U.S. fed- eral and state deferred tax assets by $15.4 and foreign deferred tax assets by $20.9, where it was more likely than not that all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized based on the Companyâ€™s estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions.
