Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. The Audit Committee oversees and monitors our financial reporting process and internal control system, reviews and
evaluates the audit performed by our registered independent public accountants and reports to the Board any substantive issues found during the audit. The Audit Committee
is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our registered independent public accountants. The Audit Committee convenes on a
quarterly basis to approve each quarterly filing, and an annual basis to review the engagement of the Companyâ€™s external auditor.
