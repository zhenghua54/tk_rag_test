On July 10, 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a five-year term. The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature permitting the Company, with the consent of the administrative agent, to increase the revolving commitments in the aggregate up to $125.0 million. No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of June 1, 2019 or during fiscal 2019. The Company had $3.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at June 1, 2019.
