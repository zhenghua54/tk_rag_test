"Other non-current assets" as of December 31, 2018 was mainly comprised of payments made relating to long lead items ordered in preparation for the conversion of the Gimi into a FLNG vessel. Subsequent to the receipt of a Limited Notice to Proceed from BP in relation to the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project in December 31, 2018, initial works of the FLNG conversion commenced in January 2019. Consequently, as of December 31, 2019, the aggregate carrying value of $31.0 million has been reclassified to "Asset under development" (see note 15).
