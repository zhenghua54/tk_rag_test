Fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.0% (8.5% in constant currency) as a result of: • an increase in the American broadband services segment mainly as a result of strong organic growth combined with the impact of the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions; and • an increase in the Canadian broadband services segment resulting mainly from a decline in operating expenses.
