Net cash provided by financing activities of $177.4 million in 2018 arose primarily due to proceeds of $1.2 billion from our debt facilities, including:
• $115.0 million further drawdown on the pre-delivery financing in relation to the conversion of the Hilli into a FLNG;
• $960.0 million drawdown on the post-acceptance Hilli sale and leaseback financing in relation to the Hilli Facility; and
• $101.0 million of debt proceeds drawn down by the lessor VIE, which owns the Golar Crystal, upon refinancing of its debt into a long-term loan facility. See note 5 "Variable Interest Entities" of our consolidated financial statements included herein.
