On August 3, 2018, we implemented a plan to restructure our organization, which included a reduction in workforce of approximately 40 employees, representing approximately 30% of the Company’s total pre-restructuring workforce. We recorded a charge of $381,000 in the third quarter of 2018 relating to this reduction in force, consisting primarily of one-time severance payments and termination benefits. The Company’s goal in the restructuring is to better focus our workforce on retaining current clients, gaining incremental business from current clients, and winning new business in the market segments where we can leverage our expertise and long history as an EFT pioneer.
