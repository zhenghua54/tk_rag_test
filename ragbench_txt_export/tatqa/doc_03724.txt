We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods on a cumulative basis in the period the estimated forfeiture rate changes for all stock-based awards when significant events occur. We consider our historical experience with employee turnover as the basis to arrive at our estimated forfeiture rate. The forfeiture rate was estimated to be 12.5% per year as of September 30, 2019. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.
