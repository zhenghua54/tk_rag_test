The Group returns capital to shareholders when consistent with its long-term capital structure objectives and where it will enhance shareholder value. In May 2019, the Group returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through an off-market share buy-back. This resulted in the purchase of 58.7 million shares which were subsequently cancelled. The share buy-back complements dividends of $1.4 billion paid to shareholders this reporting period through the 2018 final and special dividends, and the 2019 interim dividend, with a total of $3.1 billion returned to shareholders, excluding franking credits.
