Mobile spectrum capex of $352.4m in FY19 reflects the payment during the year of the second instalment for the Australian 700MHz spectrum acquired at auction in April 2017. The first instalment of $597.3m was paid in FY18 and the third and final instalment of $352.4m is payable in January 2020. A further $86.1m of capex was also incurred in FY19 in relation to the Australian mobile network rollout up until the project ceased. This expenditure on spectrum and mobile assets in Australia was partly impaired as part of the impairment review that was undertaken following the cessation of the project as described above.
