Key drivers to future growth rates are dependent on the Groupâ€™s ability to maintain and grow income streams whilst effectively managing operating costs. The level of headroom may change if different growth rate assumptions or a different pre-tax discount rate were used in the cash flow projections. Where the value-in-use calculations suggest an impairment, the Board would consider alternative use values prior to realising any impairment, being the fair value less costs to dispose.
