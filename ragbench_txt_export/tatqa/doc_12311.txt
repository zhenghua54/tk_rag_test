Investments relate to certain non-marketable equity securities in which we are a limited partner. Our interests in each of these investees range from 4% to below 20%. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. Our share of net income or losses based on our interest in these investments is recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended June 30, 2019, our share of income (loss) from these investments was $13.7 million (year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 â€” $6.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively).
