When calculating earnings per share we are required to adjust for the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock equivalents, including adjustment to the numerator for the dilutive effect of contracts that must be settled in common stock. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2019, we excluded the effects of the warrant gain and the 214,303 of potential shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants as the inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
