In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion favorable to Altera with respect to Altera’s litigation with the IRS. The litigation related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with Altera’s foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the U.S. Tax Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In June 2019, the Ninth Circuit, through a three-judge panel, reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court. Altera has petitioned the Ninth Circuit for an en banc rehearing of a larger panel of eleven Ninth Circuit judges. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of this litigation on its fiscal year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimated potential impact is in the range of $75 million, which may result in a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense.
