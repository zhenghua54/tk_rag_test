The Compensation Committee reviews compensation levels at the beginning of each fiscal year and adjusts as needed based upon market data and executive achievement. The Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our NEOs, for fiscal year 2019 and increased the salaries of our CEO and CFO in light of their contributions in fiscal year 2018, including, among other considerations, the successful execution and integration of the AvComm and Wireless acquisition and to reflect the Committee’s review of current peer and market compensation data. Mr. Staley’s salary was also increased to reflect the Committee’s review of current peer and market compensation data as well as his contributions in fiscal year 2019, including the integration of AvComm and Wireless sales into our global sales organization. The Committee did not increase the salaries of any of our other NEOs because the Committee determined that the existing base salaries were appropriate for each of these NEOs.
