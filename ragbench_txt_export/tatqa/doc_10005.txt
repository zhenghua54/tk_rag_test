Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $10.2 million to $106.5 million in 2019 compared to $116.7 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to:
• lower contribution recognized from our participation in the Cool Pool due to lower utilization and a higher number of drydocking days for our vessels for the year ended December 31, 2019;
• $24.9 million of drydocking costs as the majority of our fleet was scheduled for dry-dock during 2019;
• $9.3 million in cash receipts in connection with arbitration proceedings with a former charterer of the Golar Tundra, compared to $50.7 million recovered in 2018; and
• the reduction in the general timing of working capital in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
