ADJUSTED EBITDA Fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA increased by 26.1% (21.5% in constant currency). In local currency, adjusted EBITDA amounted to US$351.3 million compared to US$288.4 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was mainly due to the impact of the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions combined with strong organic growth. Excluding the MetroCast and FiberLight acquisitions and the prior year's non-recurring costs of $3.1 million ($US2.5 million) related to hurricane Irma, adjusted EBITDA in constant currency increased by 5.7% for fiscal 2019.
