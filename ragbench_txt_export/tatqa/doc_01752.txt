Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 23.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 from 25.0% during the same period in 2018. The lower gross profit percentage primarily reflects category sales softness, the unfavorable impact of operating leverage that arises from lower net sales relative to fixed costs, and increased freight costs and depreciation, partially offset by a reduction in variable costs.
