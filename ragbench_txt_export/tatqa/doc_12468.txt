Effective August 24, 2017, we acquired an ownership interest valued at $1.4 million in ThinxNet GmbH, a
company headquartered in Munich, Germany (“ThinxNet”). ThinxNet is an early stage company focused on
commercializing cloud-based mobile device and applications in the automotive sector throughout Europe. This
represents a cost basis investment as we cannot exercise significant influence over the investee. Contemporaneously,
we executed an unsecured convertible note receivable for $1.27 million with an interest rate of 6%, which has a fixed
term of 12 months, after which the loan can be converted into equity in ThinxNet or a loan due on demand at our
option. The equity investment and note receivable were consideration we received in exchange for our outstanding
accounts receivable from ThinxNet. No gain or loss was recorded on this exchange. The assets received in this
exchange are included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2019 and 2018.
