The Company classifies its financial instrument within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis of models utilizing market observable inputs. The interest rate swap has been valued on the basis of valuations provided by third-party pricing services, as derived from standard valuation or pricing models. Market-based observable inputs for the interest rate swap include one month LIBOR-based yield curves over the term of the swap. The Company reviews third-party pricing provider models, key inputs and assumptions and understands the pricing processes at its third-party providers in determining the overall reasonableness of the fair value of its Level 2 financial instruments. The Company also considers the risk of nonperformance by assessing the swap counterparty's credit risk in the estimate of fair value of the interest rate swap. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has not made any adjustments to the valuations obtained from its third party pricing providers.
