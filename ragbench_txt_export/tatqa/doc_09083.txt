We generated a net cash inflow from operating activities of £4,256m, down £671m, mainly driven by £2bn contributions to the BT Pension Scheme, offset by favourable working capital movements. In line with our outlook, normalised free cash flowb was £2,440m, down £533m or 18%, driven by increased cash capital expenditure, decrease in EBITDA and higher tax payments.
