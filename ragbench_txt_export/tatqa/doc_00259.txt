During the year ended December 31, 2019, shipping revenues decreased by $10,616 or 2.9% compared to 2018. The decrease primarily resulted from three fewer vessels in operation during most of 2019 compared to 2018 and one less Government of Israel voyage in 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was partially offset by the addition of two new vessels to our fleet at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019.
