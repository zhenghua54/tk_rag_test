The increase in income before income taxes in System Test from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5‚Äù hard disk drive testers, higher sales in Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and higher sales in Production Board Test from higher 5G demand. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products and services. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to higher sales and marketing, and engineering spending.
