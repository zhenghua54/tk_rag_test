Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries because the Company’s practice and intent is to permanently reinvest these earnings. The cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings was $5.3 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Any future distribution of these non-US earnings may subject the Company to state income taxes, as adjusted for tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes that the Company estimates would be $0.1 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
