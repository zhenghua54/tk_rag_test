We have tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $5.1 million available to offset future state tax. These tax credit carry-forwards
expire in 2020 to 2029. These credits represent a deferred tax asset of $4.0 million after consideration of the federal benefit of state tax
deductions. A valuation allowance of $1.8 million has been established for these credits because the ability to use them is not more
likely than not.
