(2) Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DIO is based on ending inventory and cost of revenues for each period. DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. The increase in DIO in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher levels of finished goods on hand at the end of fiscal 2019. Compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, the decrease in DIO in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was due primarily to strong product sales towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
