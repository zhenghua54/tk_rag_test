On October 10, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with SVB, which amended and restated in its entirety our previous Credit Facility. Under the Loan Agreement, SVB agreed to make advances available up to $10.0 million (the “Revolving Line”). If we borrow from the Revolving Line, such borrowing would carry a floating annual interest rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) then in effect plus 1% or (ii) 6%. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line may be repaid and, prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date (defined below), reborrowed. The Revolving Line terminates on October 10, 2020 (the “Revolving Line Maturity Date”), unless earlier terminated by us. No amounts have been borrowed under this Loan Agreement.
