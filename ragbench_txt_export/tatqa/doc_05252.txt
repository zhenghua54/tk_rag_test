A portion of the interest rate charged on our Term Loan is currently based on LIBOR and, at our option, a component of the interest charged on the borrowings outstanding on our ABL, if any, may bear interest rates based on LIBOR. LIBOR has been the subject of reform and is expected to phase out by the end of fiscal 2021. The consequences of the discontinuation of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could impact the interest expense we incur on these debt instruments. We will negotiate alternatives to LIBOR with our lenders before LIBOR ceases to be a widely available reference rate.
