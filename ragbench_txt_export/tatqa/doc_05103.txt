The Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5) and the Term Loan Agreement generally require our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to interest expense not to be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA not to exceed certain decreasing specified levels, ranging from 5.875 through the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 3.75 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and thereafter, with each ratio to be calculated on a rolling fourquarter basis. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Agreement.
