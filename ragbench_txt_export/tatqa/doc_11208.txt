Also, as part of the share purchase agreement, the unvested restricted shares of certain employees of Meta Networks were exchanged into the right to receive $7,827 of deferred cash consideration and 72 shares of the Company’s common stock that were deferred with the fair value of $8,599. The deferred cash consideration was presented as restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The deferred cash consideration of $7,596 and the deferred stock $8,338 (see Note 11 “Equity Award Plans”) were allocated to post-combination expense and were not included in the purchase price. The deferred cash consideration and deferred shares are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions, and their fair value is expensed as compensation and stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period.
