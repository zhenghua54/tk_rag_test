Our operating profit in 2019 was EUR 485 million, a change of EUR 544 million, compared to an operating loss of EUR 59 million in 2018. The change in operating result was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses and a net positive fluctuation in other operating income and expenses, partially offset by lower gross profit. Our operating margin in 2019 was 2.1%, compared to approximately breakeven in 2018.
