The Employee Performance Rights Plan (the Rights Plan) was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 23 November 2017. Under the Rights Plan, awards are made to eligible executives and other management personnel who have an impact on the Group’s performance. Rights Plan awards are granted in the form of performance rights over shares, which vest over a period of three years subject to meeting performance measures and continuous employment with the Company. Each performance right is to subscribe for one ordinary share upon vesting and, when issued, the shares will rank equally with other shares.
