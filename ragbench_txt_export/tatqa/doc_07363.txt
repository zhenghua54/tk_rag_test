ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” (Topic 280), establishes standards for reporting, by public business enterprises, information about operating segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The method of determining what information, under Topic 280, to report is based on the way that an entity organizes operating segments for making operational decisions and how the entity’s management and chief operating decision maker (CODM) assess an entity’s financial performance. Our operations are analyzed by management and our CODM as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Enterprise Information Management software and solutions.
