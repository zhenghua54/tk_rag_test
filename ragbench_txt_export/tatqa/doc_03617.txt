Interest Expense. Interest expense results from interest incurred on our $445.0 million of senior secured notes, interest incurred on our $189.2 million of senior unsecured notes, interest on our installment payment agreement and interest on our finance lease obligations. Our interest expense increased by 5.3% for 2018 from 2017 primarily due to the issuance of $70.0 million of senior secured notes in August 2018 and an increase in our finance lease obligations.
