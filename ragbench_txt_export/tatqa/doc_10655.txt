In fiscal year 2019, our Telecom market revenue decreased by $42.0 million, or 18.8%, compared to fiscal year 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the full year effect of our May 2018 sale of the Japan-based long-range optical subassembly business (the "LR4 Business"), lower sales of carrier-based optical semiconductor products to our Asia customer base, as well as lower sales of products targeting fiber to the home applications.
