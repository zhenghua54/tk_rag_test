The Company’s liabilities for unpaid and incurred, but not reported claims, for workers’ compensation, general liability, and health insurance at September 2019 and September 2018 was $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. These amounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in the Company’s opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims previously incurred. However, it is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.
