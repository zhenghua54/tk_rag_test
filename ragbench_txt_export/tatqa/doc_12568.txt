Volatilityâ€”The Company estimates the expected volatility of the common stock underlying its stock options at the grant date. Prior to 2018, the Company estimated the expected volatility of the common stock underlying stock options, warrants and equity awards issued under its 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. The Company used this method because it had limited information on the volatility of its Class A common stock because of its short trading history. Beginning in 2018, the Company used a combination of historical volatility from its Class A common stock along with historical volatility from the group of comparable publicly traded companies.
