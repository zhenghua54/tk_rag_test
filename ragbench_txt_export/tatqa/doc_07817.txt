The amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been prepared based on our adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’) No. 606, Contracts with Customers. We elected to adopt this accounting standard on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in the impact of adoption being recorded as of January 1, 2018. The amounts in all other years, other than 2019 and 2018, in the tables below have been prepared on the previously outstanding guidance on revenue recognition. We have disclosed the ASC 606 adoption impact on our revenue recognition in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report
