We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on its technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $5,016 of unrecognized tax benefits, which if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We do not anticipate any significant changes in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
