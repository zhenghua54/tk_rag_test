Recurring revenue decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to prior year due to known attrition within the EIS and other businesses partially offset with growth in subscription revenue. The sale of the OneContent business on April 2, 2018 also contributed to the decline in recurring revenue. The OneContent business was acquired as part of the EIS Business acquisition on October 2, 2017, and it contributed $13 million of recurring revenue during the first quarter of 2018, including $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments. Non-recurring revenue increased due to higher sales of perpetual software licenses for our acute solutions and hardware in 2019 compared to 2018, partially offset by lower client services revenue related to the timing of software activations.
