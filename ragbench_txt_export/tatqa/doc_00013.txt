On December 31, 2018, we sold all of the Class A Common Units of Netsmart owned by the Company. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is now reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale for all periods presented. The loss from discontinued operations represents the net of losses incurred by Netsmart for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 partly offset by earnings attributable to two solutions acquired during the fourth quarter of 2017 as part of the EIS Business that we no longer support effective as of March 31, 2018. Refer to Note 17, “Discontinued Operations” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
