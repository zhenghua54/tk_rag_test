Research and development expenses decreased by $1.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a reduction in contract labour and consulting of $6.8 million and a reduction in the use of facility and related expenses of $4.8 million, partially offset by an increase in payroll and payroll-related benefits of $12.6 million. The increase in payroll and payroll-related benefits was driven primarily by increased headcount from recent acquisitions. Overall, our research and development expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, remained stable at approximately 11% compared to prior fiscal year.
