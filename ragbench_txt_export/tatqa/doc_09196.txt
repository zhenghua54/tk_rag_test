We capitalized approximately $8.9 million in total development costs during fiscal 2018. Total product development costs, including operating expenses and capitalized amounts, were $40.1 million during fiscal 2019 compared to $38.4 million in fiscal 2018. The $1.7 million increase is mostly due to continued expansion of our R&D teams and increased compensation expense as a result of bonus earnings.
