We do not direct the day-to-day operations and selection process of individual securities and investments and, accordingly, we have retained the professional services of investment management organizations to fulfill those tasks. The investment management organizations have investment discretion over the assets placed under their management. We provide each investment manager with specific investment guidelines by asset class.
