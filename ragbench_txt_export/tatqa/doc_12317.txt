Impairment charges in  2018 included $145  million allocated to indefinite-life intangible assets, and $14 million allocated to finite-life intangible assets. These impairment charges primarily relate to our French TV channels within our Bell Media segment. These impairments were the result of revenue and profitability declines from lower audience levels and subscriber erosion. The charges were determined by comparing the carrying value of the CGUs to their fair value less costs of disposal. We estimated the fair value of the CGUs using both discounted cash flows and market-based valuation models, which include five-year cash flow projections derived from business plans reviewed by senior management for the period of January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023, using a discount rate of 8.0% to 8.5% and a perpetuity growth rate of nil, as well as market multiple data from public companies and market transactions. The carrying value of these CGUs was $515 million at December 31, 2018. In the previous year’s impairment analysis, the company’s French Pay and French Specialty TV channels were tested for recoverability separately. In 2018, the CGUs were grouped to form one French CGU which reflects the evolution of the cash flows from our content strategies as well as the CRTC beginning to regulate Canadian broadcasters under a group licence approach based on language.
