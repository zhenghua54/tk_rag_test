Net cash used in operating activities was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $3.8 million, capitalized debt discount of $172 thousand and a gain on the debt extinguishment of $296 thousand. This net loss was partially offset by non-cash items such as $218 thousand in share-based compensation expense, $87 thousand of debt discount and debt issue cost amortization expense, $73 thousand of depreciation expense, and $207 thousand of intangible asset amortization expense with $183 thousand in net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $896 thousand were primarily due to $66 thousand increase in royalty receivable and $830 thousand decreases in both accrued interest and accrued expenses. These cash outflows were partially offset by a $109 thousand decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and increase of $604 in accounts payable.
