When the Group refers a consumer to the product provider (and thereby satisfies its performance obligation), the Group is entitled to an upfront fee that is contingent upon the following events: (a) the referred sale becoming ‘financial’, which occurs upon new members joining a health fund, initiating a life insurance policy, obtaining general insurance products, mortgages, broadband or energy products via iSelect; and (b) whether a ‘clawback’ of the upfront fee is triggered. Upfront fees may trigger a ‘clawback’ of revenue in the event of early termination by customers as specified in individual product provider agreements. These contingencies are incorporated into the estimate of variable consideration (refer to key estimates).
