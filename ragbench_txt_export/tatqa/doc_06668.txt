Net cash used in financing activities for 2019 of $8.4 million was primarily due to $18.2 million in net cash used for payment of taxes on common stock issued under our employee equity incentive plans and $2.7 million used for financing lease payments, offset in part by $13.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from stock purchases made through our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP.
