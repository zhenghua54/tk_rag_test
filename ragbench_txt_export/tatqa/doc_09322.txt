Under the new standard, we record accounts receivable and related contract liabilities for non-cancelable contracts with customers when the right to consideration is unconditional. Upon adoption, the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time were reclassified from accounts receivable to contract assets.
