Expenditure on development activities is charged as incurred, or deferred where these costs are directly associated with either integration of acquired technology or the development of new technology and it is determined that the technology has reached technological feasibility. Costs are deferred to future periods to the extent that they are expected beyond any reasonable doubt to be recoverable. The costs capitalised comprises directly attributable costs, including costs of materials, services and direct labour. Deferred costs are amortised from the date of commercial release on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit, which varies from 2 to 10 years.
