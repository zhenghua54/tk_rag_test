The impact on the total fair value of derivatives liability and the inverse to change in fair value of financial instruments (allocated and unallocated swaps) of a 50 basis point increase in the level of interest rates would be a credit to the income statement and increase in equity of £67.8 million (2018: £78.8 million). The approximate impact of a 50-basis point reduction in the level of interest rates would be a charge to the income statement and decrease in equity of £67.8 million (2018: £78.8 million). In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely. However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may occur. Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
