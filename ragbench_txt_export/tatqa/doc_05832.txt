Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $72.8 million, resulting in a free cash flow margin of 12.6%, as compared to free cash flow of $49.8 million and a free cash flow margin of 9.3% for the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to both improved profitability and collections, and is partially offset by cash paid for interest on our convertible notes of $17.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on the convertible notes.
