The 2019 tax provision results primarily from foreign tax expense, the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act. The 2019 tax provision differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.
