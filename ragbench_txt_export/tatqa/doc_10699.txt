During fiscal 2017, we incurred $74.8 million of expenses in connection with the Spinoff primarily related to professional fees and contract services associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities. These expenses are reflected in income from discontinued operations. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recognized income tax expense of $2.8 million and an income tax benefit of $14.5 million, respectively, due to adjustments of the estimated deductibility of these costs.
