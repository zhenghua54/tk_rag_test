The Company believes that with this acquisition, it will benefit from increased messaging threat intelligence from the analysis of billions of daily emails, malicious domain intelligence, and visibility into fraudulent and malicious SMS messages directed to mobile carriers worldwide. The Company also expects to achieve savings in corporate overhead costs for the combined entities. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of acquired net identifiable assets and, as a result, goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition.
