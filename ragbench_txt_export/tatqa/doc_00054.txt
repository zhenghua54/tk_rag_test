Sales growth improved in the second half (H1: 1.9%, normalised H2: 3.0%) driven by positive comparable transaction growth and aided by a recovery in market growth post Christmas. Sales per square metre increased by 6.4%(normalised 4.5%) due to strong sales growth and a 2.0% reduction in trading space following store closures. During the year, three stores were closed and two stores were opened with 180 Countdown supermarkets at the end of the year.
