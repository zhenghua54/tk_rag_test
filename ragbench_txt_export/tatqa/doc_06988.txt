We agreed 205 long-term leases in 2019, amounting to £26 million annual rent, at an average of 1 per cent above previous passing rent (like-for-like units) and in line with valuers’ assumptions. On a net effective basis (net of rent frees and incentives), rents were also 1 per cent ahead of previous rents. The upside from these new lettings added to like-for-like net rental income but was lower in magnitude than the negative impacts from administrations and CVAs and increased vacancy (see financial review on pages 30 to 37).
