In June 2019, one of our lightering customers, PES, suffered an explosion and fire at its refinery in the Delaware Bay. The PES refinery complex, which consists of two refineries, has been shut down since the fire. Due to the expected reduction in lightering volumes, we redeployed one of our two lightering ATBs to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for alternative employment.
