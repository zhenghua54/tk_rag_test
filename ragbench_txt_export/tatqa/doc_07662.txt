The Group recognised a provision on future lease payments for one of our offices in the Americas, as the non-cancellable future payments in the lease contract are expected to exceed the benefits from keeping the office over the remainder of the lease term. The Group has separately identified these costs because it is not in the normal course of business activities. These costs are included with 'Property and Operating Rental Expenses' in the Groupâ€™s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
