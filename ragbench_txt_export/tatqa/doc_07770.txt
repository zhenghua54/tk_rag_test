Included in the unrecognized tax benefits at fiscal 2019 and 2018 is $38.2 million and $36.7 million, respectively, that if recognized, would result in a reduction of our effective tax rate. The amounts differ from the long-term liability recorded of $20.1 million and $16.8 million as of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to accrued interest and penalties, as well as unrecognized tax benefits of French and Italian entities that are recorded against deferred tax asset balances without valuation allowance.
