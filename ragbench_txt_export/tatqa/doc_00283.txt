Foreign Exchange Loss. Foreign currency exchange losses were $13.6 million in 2019 compared to gains of $6.1 million in 2018. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses, substantially all of which are unrealized, are primarily due to the relevant period-end revaluation of our Norwegian-Krone (or NOK)-denominated debt and our Euro-denominated term loans, finance leases and restricted cash for financial reporting purposes and the realized and unrealized (losses) gains on our cross currency swaps.
