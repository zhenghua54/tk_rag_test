During 2017, we offered certain former vested employees in our U.S. pension plan a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits from pension plan assets. The pension plan made approximately $23,912 in lump sum payments to settle its obligation to these participants. These settlement payments decreased the projected benefit obligation and plan assets by $23,912, and resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $13,476 related to unrecognized net actuarial losses that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The measurement date of this settlement was December 31, 2017.
