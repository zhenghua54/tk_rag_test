Accounts receivable represent amounts owing to us that are currently due and collectible. We initially recognize accounts receivable on the date they originate. We measure accounts receivable initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortized cost, with changes recognized in net income. We measure an impairment loss for accounts receivable as the excess of the carrying amount over the present value of future cash flows we expect to derive from it, if any. The excess is allocated to an allowance for doubtful accounts and recognized as a loss in net income.
