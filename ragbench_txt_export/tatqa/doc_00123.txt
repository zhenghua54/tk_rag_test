We measure inventories, including wireless devices and merchandise for resale, at the lower of cost (determined on a weighted average cost basis for Wireless devices and accessories and a first-in, first-out basis for other finished goods and merchandise) and net realizable value. We reverse a previous writedown to net realizable value, not to exceed the original recognized cost, if the inventories later increase in value.
