At June 30, 2019, the Company’s total off-balance sheet contractual obligations were $665,107. This balance consists of $71,633 of long-term operating leases for various facilities and equipment which expire from 2020 to 2030 and $593,474 of purchase commitments. In fiscal 2017, JHA entered a strategic services agreement with First Data® and PSCU® to provide full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers, as well as expand its card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base. This agreement includes a purchase commitment of $555,754 over the remaining term of the contract. The remainder of the purchase commitments relate mainly to open purchase orders. The contractual obligations table below excludes $12,009 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.
