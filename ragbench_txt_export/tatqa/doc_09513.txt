The nominal value of unallocated swaps, which are excluded from the above table, is £483.4 million (2018: £566.7 million). Their fair value of £166.7 million (2018: £184.4 million) is included as a liability in the balance sheet. The term of each unallocated swap runs until its respective maturity date, the last of which runs until 2037, but each also has a mandatory or discretionary break clause which, unless otherwise agreed, would lead to earlier termination between 2020 and 2023. In the event of an early termination of an unallocated swap, a settlement amount is immediately payable by the Group.
