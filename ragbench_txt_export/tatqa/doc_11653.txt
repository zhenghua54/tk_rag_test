The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income taxes in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. If the Company utilizes net operating losses or tax credits in future years, the U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. tax authorities may examine the tax returns covering the period in which the net operating losses and tax credits arose. As a result, the Companyâ€™s tax returns in the U.S. and California remain open to examination from fiscal years 2002 through 2019. As of July 31, 2019, the Company has no income tax audits in progress in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions.
