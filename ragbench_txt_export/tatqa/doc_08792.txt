In addition, Level 2 assets and liabilities include derivative financial instruments associated with hedging activity, which are further discussed in Note 4. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using inputs such as spot rates, forward rates, and discount rates. There is not an active market for each hedge contract, but the inputs used to calculate the value of the instruments are tied to active markets.
