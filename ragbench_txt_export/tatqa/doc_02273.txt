The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.
