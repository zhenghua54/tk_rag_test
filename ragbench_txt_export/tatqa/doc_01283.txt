Revenue for product sales is recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the Company’s customers, which is generally when products are shipped from the Company’s manufacturing facilities or when delivered to the customer’s named location. When the Company performs shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery), they are considered to be fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected on behalf of customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities, principally sales taxes, are excluded from revenue.
