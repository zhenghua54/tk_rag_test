The Company adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606, which was immaterial, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative prior period information is accounted for in accordance with the previous revenue guidance, ASC 605, and has not been restated. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to the Companyâ€™s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
