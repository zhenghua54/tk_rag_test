Broadcast station revenue is recognized over the life of the contract, when the program is broadcast. The fees that we charge can be fixed or variable and the contracts that the Company enters into are generally short-term in nature. Variable fees are usage/salesbased and recognized as revenue when the subsequent usage occurs. Transaction prices are based on the contract terms, with no material judgments or estimates.
