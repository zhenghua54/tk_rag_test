The net deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2018 in the above table include the deferred tax assets of our Italian and Canadian subsidiaries amounting to $7.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively, which were disclosed narratively in the fiscal 2018 Form 10-K. The deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating losses (NOLâ€™s) and research and development expenditure pool carryforwards. We had provided a 100% valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets at February 28, 2018, as it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized.
