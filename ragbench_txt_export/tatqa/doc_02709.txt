The $455.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily related to an incremental borrowing to fund our D&B Investment as well as fewer share repurchases. The $96.8 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to tax distributions to BKFS LLC members and the senior notes redemption fee in 2017.
