VMware operates in one reportable operating segment, thus all required financial segment information is included in the consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. VMwareâ€™s chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the consolidated level.
