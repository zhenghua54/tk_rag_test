Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to discharge its obligations and cause a financial loss and arises from cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, favorable derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including trade and other receivables, dividends receivable and other amounts due from related parties. The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by any of its counterparties. To limit this risk, the Group currently deals primarily with financial institutions and customers with high credit ratings.
