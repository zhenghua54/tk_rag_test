As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Teradyne evaluated the likelihood that it would realize deferred income taxes to offset future taxable income and concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of its deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Teradyne maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of $77.2 million and $69.9 million, respectively, primarily related to state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards, due to the uncertainty regarding their realization. Adjustments could be required in the future if Teradyne estimates that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount recorded.
