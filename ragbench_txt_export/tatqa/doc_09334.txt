The Groupâ€™s profit before taxation increased by $94.6 million to $53.6 million, from a loss of $41.0 million in the prior-year, primarily as a consequence of the $80.6 million improvement in operating profit supported by a $13.4 million reduction in finance expenses. Finance expenses benefited from foreign exchange gains in the current year resulting from the strengthening of both sterling and the euro against the US dollar, compared to foreign exchange losses in the prior-year.
