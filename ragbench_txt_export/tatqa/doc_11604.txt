As a result of our acquisition of Rofin on November 7, 2016, we made a payment of $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin. The payment was allocated between total estimated merger consideration of $11.1 million and post-merger stock-based compensation expense of $4.2 million, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, based on the portion of the total service period of the underlying options that have not been completed by the merger date.
