The Group recognises a liability for long service leave and annual leave measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on corporate bond rates with terms to maturity and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
