These variable considerations are constrained to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. In determining the extent of constraint necessary to ensure to a high probability that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur, the Group performs a detailed assessment of the accuracy of previously forecast assumptions against historical results.
