The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. As of June 1, 2019, there were no uncertain tax positions that resulted in any adjustment to the Companyâ€™s provision for income taxes.
