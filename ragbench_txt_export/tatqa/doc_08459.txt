In April 2018, our compensation committee reviewed the base salaries of Mses. Friar, Henry, Reses and Whiteley, taking into consideration a competitive market analysis performed by Compensia, the recommendations of our CEO and our then-current People Lead, the desire to retain our highly qualified executive team and the other factors described above. Following this review, our compensation committee approved an increase in the annual base salary levels for Mses. Friar, Henry, Reses and Whiteley to $400,000, in each case effective as of April 1, 2018, in order to improve competitive alignment with our peers. In addition, our compensation committee determined that it was appropriate to leave our CEOâ€™s 2018 base salary level at $2.75 per year, at the request of our CEO and with compensation committee approval.
