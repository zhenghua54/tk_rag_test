Vessels under construction represent scheduled advance payments to the shipyards as well as certain capitalized expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the Group has paid to the shipyard $197,637 for the vessels that are under construction and expects to pay the remaining installments as they come due upon each vesselâ€™s keel laying, launching and delivery (Note 23(a)).
