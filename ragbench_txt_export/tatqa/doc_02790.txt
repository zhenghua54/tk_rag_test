Revenue from the resale of ancillary products, primarily consisting of hardware, is customer- and project-driven and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to only $2 million in amortization of acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments being recorded during 2019, compared to $24.3 million during 2018.
