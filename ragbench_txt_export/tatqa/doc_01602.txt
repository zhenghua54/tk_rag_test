Interest income increased by $16.9 million in fiscal year 2019. The increase in our interest income is associated with the increase in invested funds, primarily as a result of proceeds of approximately $600 million related to the common stock and convertible note offering in March 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher yields on those invested funds.
