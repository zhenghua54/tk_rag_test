The Company leases many assets, including land, buildings, houses, motor vehicles, machinery and equipment. Leases typically run up to a period of 5 years, some with an option to renew the lease after the end of the non-cancelable period. Lease payments are renegotiated on a periodic basis; timing is depending on the region and type of lease. The Company has not entered into any sub-lease arrangements.
