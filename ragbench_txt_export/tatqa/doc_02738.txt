The GBS profit margin increased 0.9 points to 27.7 percent and pre-tax income of $1,666 million increased 2.2 percent year to year. The pre-tax margin of 9.9 percent increased slightly year to year. The year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income were driven by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery productivity improvements and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model.
