Net revenue is derived from the long-distance data and transit traffic. Net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call multiplied by the price per minute, and is recorded upon completion of a call. Completed calls are billable activity while incomplete calls are non-billable. Incomplete calls may occur as a result of technical issues or because the customerâ€™s credit limit was exceeded and thus the customer routing of traffic was prevented.
