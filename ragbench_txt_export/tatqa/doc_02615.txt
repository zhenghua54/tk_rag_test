At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $194.2 million and $151.9 million, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2019 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth.
