Volume from large orders increased significantly year-over-year; among the contract wins was a € 0.4 billion order for a combined-cycle power plant, including service in France; a HVDC order worth € 0.4 billion in Germany; a € 0.3 billion order for a large offshore grid connection project in the U. K.; and a € 0.3 billion order in the solutions business in Brazil. Order intake increased in all three reporting
regions, with the Americas posting double-digit growth.
