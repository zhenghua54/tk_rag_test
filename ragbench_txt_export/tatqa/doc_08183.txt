Our operations and strategic objectives require continuing capital investment, and our resources include cash on hand and cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings and access to capital markets. Management believes that cash generated by or available to us should be sufficient to fund our capital and liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
