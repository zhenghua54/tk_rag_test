The Company through August 30, 2019 had three reportable segments from which it derived its revenues: Dry Bulk Vessel Operations, Logistics Business and Containers Business. The Containers Business became a reportable segment as a result of the consolidation of Navios Containers since November 30, 2018 (date of obtaining control) (see also Note 3). Following the reclassification of the results of Navios Containers as discontinued operations (see also Note 3), the Company currently has two reportable segments from which it derives its revenues: Dry Bulk Vessel Operations and Logistics. The reportable segments reflect the internal organization of the Company and are strategic businesses that offer different products and services. The Dry Bulk Vessel Operations consists of the transportation and handling of bulk cargoes through the ownership, operation, and trading of vessels. The Logistics Business consists of operating ports and transfer station terminals, handling of vessels, barges and pushboats as well as upriver transport facilities in the Hidrovia region.
