Furthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018.
