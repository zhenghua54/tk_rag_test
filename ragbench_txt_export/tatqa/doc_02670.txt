The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its field examination of the Company’s tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on May 27, 2015, which was updated on June 22, 2016. The IRS completed its field examination of the Company’s tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and issued an RAR on April 19, 2017. The proposed adjustments in the RAR from both examination periods relate primarily to U.S. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. On May 8, 2019, the tax return audits for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 were effectively settled when the Company agreed to the IRS Office of Appeals’ Form 870-AD (Offer to Waive Restrictions on Assessment and Collection of Tax Deficiency and to Accept Overassessment) adjustments, which were substantially lower than the initial RAR proposed adjustments. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and no additional tax liabilities were recorded.
