The Company has two license agreements for currently marketed products containing its technologies; the Oxaydo product containing the Aversion Technology has been licensed to Zyla and the Nexafed products containing the Impede Technology which have been licensed to MainPointe. On January 1, 2020, MainPointe assigned to AD Pharma, with Acura’s consent, all of its right, title and interest in the MainPointe Agreement between MainPointe and Acura. All of the Company’s royalty revenues are earned from these two license agreements by the licensee’s sale of products in the United States.
