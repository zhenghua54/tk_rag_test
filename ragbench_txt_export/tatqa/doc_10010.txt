This was partially offset by receipts of:
• $115.2 million of proceeds from Keppel's initial subscription and subsequent cash calls in relation to its 30% equity interest in Gimi MS;
• $29.2 million of dividends received from Golar Partners; and
• $9.7 million of cash consideration received from Golar Partners in respect of the remaining net purchase price less working capital adjustments in connection with the Hilli acquisition.
