Total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019 (35.9% of total capital) compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2018 (39.1% of total capital). Our increased total debt at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 was due primarily to the issuance of $500.0 of 2.35% senior unsecured notes and $700.0 of 2.95% senior unsecured notes, partially offset by the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $865.0.
