Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost including transaction costs and are accounted for using the equity method by including the Groupâ€™s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of associates in the carrying amount of the investment until the date on which significant influence ceases. Dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment in associates.
