Still, the U. S. market environment remained challenging
as pressure on reimbursement systems and the focus on more
extended utilization of equipment at customers’ sites persist.
Government initiatives and programs, together with a growing private market segment contributed to the re-stabilization and growth of markets in China. For the healthcare industry as a whole, the trend towards consolidation continued in fiscal 2019,
leading to higher utilization rates at customers’ sites, which are counterbalancing procedure volume growth in developed markets. Competition among the leading healthcare companies remained at a high level. For fiscal 2020, Siemens Healthineers expects the imaging and advanced therapies equipment markets to stay on a moderate growth path, while the diagnostics market is expected to grow clearly. Siemens Healthineers’ markets will continue to benefit from the long-term trends mentioned above, but are restricted by public spending constraints and by consolidation among healthcare providers.
