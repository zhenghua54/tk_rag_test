Net cash used in financing activities is principally generated from funds from new debt, debt refinancings, debt repayments and cash dividends. Net cash used in financing activities of $136.0 million in 2019 arose primarily due to: • scheduled debt repayments of $443.1 million; • $100.0 million repayment of the Margin Loan following refinancing; • $9.1 million repayment upon the extension of the Golar Arctic facility; • payment of dividends of $65.0 million; • financing costs of $24.5 million predominately in relation to the Gimi debt facility; and • payment of $18.6 million in relation to the 1.5 million treasury shares repurchased on our equity swap in November 2019.
