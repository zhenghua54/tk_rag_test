Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $105.8 million to $59.4 million from $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Pre-tax Insurance AOI for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $85.1 million to $85.7 million from $0.6 million for year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the incremental net investment income and policy premiums from the KIC block acquisition and higher net investment income from the legacy CGI block driven by both the growth and mix of the investment portfolio, including premium reinvestment and rotation into higher yield assets. In addition, there was a decrease in policy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions related to current period reserve adjustments driven by higher mortality and policy terminations, an increase in contingent non-forfeiture option activity as a result of in-force rate actions approved and implemented, and favorable developments in claims activity. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily attributable to headcount additions related to the KIC acquisition.
