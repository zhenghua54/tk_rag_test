As at 31 December 2019 and 2018, management considered that any reasonable changes in the interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group’s results as the Group’s exposure to cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for interest rate risk.
