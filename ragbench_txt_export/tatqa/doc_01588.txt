Other income (expense), net changed $9.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 compared to the year ended March 31, 2017, which was primarily attributable to a change of $10.4 million in foreign exchange expense which was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of short-term intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units. The increase in interest income is primarily due to interest on investments.
