Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting these offerings while market demand for maintenance services and updates that enhance reliability, as well as the desire for flexibility in purchasing options, continue to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.
