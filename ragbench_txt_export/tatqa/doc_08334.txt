The increase in other current financial assets was driven by higher loans receivable at SFS, which were mainly due to new business and reclassification of non-current loans receivable from other financial assets. While higher loans receivable and receivables from finance leases from new business at SFS contributed also to growth in other financial assets, a large extent of the overall increase resulted from increased fair values of derivative financial instruments.
