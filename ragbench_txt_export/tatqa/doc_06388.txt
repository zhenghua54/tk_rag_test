On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased by 4.0%. ADG revenues decreased 4.5% compared to the year-ago quarter on lower revenues in both Automotive and Power Discrete. The decrease was entirely due to lower average selling prices of approximately 4%, while volumes remained substantially flat. The decrease in average selling prices was a combination of less favorable product mix and lower selling prices.
