In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the writedown of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
