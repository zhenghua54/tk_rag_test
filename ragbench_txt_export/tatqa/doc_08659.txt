We define adjusted EBITDA as operating revenues less operating costs as shown in BCE’s consolidated income statements. Adjusted EBITDA for BCE’s segments is the same as segment profit as reported in Note 3, Segmented information, in BCE’s 2019 consolidated financial statements. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues.
