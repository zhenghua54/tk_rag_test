Following the termination of the finance lease arrangements for the RasGas II LNG Carriers in 2014, the lessor made a determination that additional rentals were due under the leases following a challenge by the UK taxing authority. As a result, in 2017 the Teekay Nakilat Joint Venture recognized an additional liability, which was included as part of other loss in the Company's consolidated statements of loss.
