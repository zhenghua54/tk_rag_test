Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Energy segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $5.9 million to $17.1 million from $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to overall growth in volumes of gasoline gallons delivered and higher commodity and utility costs driven by the acquisition of ampCNG stations.
