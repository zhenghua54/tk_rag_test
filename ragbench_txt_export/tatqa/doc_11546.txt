The FCC requires certain television stations to change channels and/or modify their transmission facilities. The U.S. Congress passed legislation which provides the FCC with a fund to reimburse all reasonable costs incurred by stations operating under full power and Class A licenses and a portion of the costs incurred by stations operating under a low power license that are reassigned to new channels.
