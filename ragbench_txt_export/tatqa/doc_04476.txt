We provide product warranties when we sell our products and accrue for estimated liabilities at the time of sale. Warranty estimates are forecasts based on the best available information and historical claims experience. We accrue for specific warranty claims if we believe that the facts of a specific claim make it probable that a liability in excess of our historical experience has been incurred, and provide disclosures for specific claims whenever it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred which cannot be estimated. We have an outstanding warranty claim for which we have not yet determined the root cause of a product performance issue. Testing is ongoing. We are not able to quantify the potential impact on our operations, if any, because we have not yet determined the root cause.
