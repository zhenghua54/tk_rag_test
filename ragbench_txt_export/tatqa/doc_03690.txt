The recoverable amount of the Home loans CGU as at 31 December 2018 was determined at $5.6m based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by Senior Management covering a five-year period. The projected cash flows were updated to reflect a change in Senior Management and their initial views as part of a strategic review undertaken. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 13% (30 June 2018: 25%) and cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using a 3% growth rate (30 June 2018: 3%). As a result of this analysis, management recognised an impairment charge of $4,450,000 against goodwill and capitalised software development costs. No other impairment was identified for the CGUs to which goodwill or brand names are allocated.
