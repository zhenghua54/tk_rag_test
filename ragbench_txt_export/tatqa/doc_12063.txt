The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groupâ€™s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency. Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date is used.
