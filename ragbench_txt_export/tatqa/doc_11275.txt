(3) Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DPO for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was relatively unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, while it increased compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of improved vendor payables management and extensions of payment terms with our suppliers.
