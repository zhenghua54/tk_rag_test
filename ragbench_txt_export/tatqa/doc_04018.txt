The valuation allowance decreased by $75.8 million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets. As of December 28, 2019, we maintained a valuation allowance of $36.6 million, primarily related to California deferred tax assets and foreign tax credit carryovers, due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets.
