During the period, 13.4% (2018: 39.9%) of the dividends paid were reinvested in shares of the Company. The change in the reinvestment participation rate reflects the removal of the discount with effect from the 2018 final dividend paid on 12 October 2018. The DRP in respect of the 2019 interim dividend was satisfied in full through the on-market purchase and transfer of $73 million of shares to participating shareholders.
