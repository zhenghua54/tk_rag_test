Our restructuring program (“Program”) is defined as the initiatives associated with our Reinvent SEE strategy in addition to the conclusion of our previously existing restructuring programs at the time of Reinvent SEE's approval. Reinvent SEE is a three-year program approved by the Board of Directors in December 2018. The expected spend in the previously existing program at the time of Reinvent SEE's approval was primarily related to elimination of stranded costs following the sale of Diversey. The Company expects restructuring activities to be completed by the end of 2021.
