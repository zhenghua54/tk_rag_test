The amounts in the salary, bonus, and non-equity incentive plan compensation columns of the Summary Compensation Table reflect actual amounts paid for the relevant years, while the amounts in the stock awards column reflect accounting values. The tables entitled “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table” and “Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table” provide further information on the named executive officers’ potential realizable value and actual value realized with respect to their equity awards. The Summary Compensation Table should be read in conjunction with the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the subsequent tables and narrative descriptions.
