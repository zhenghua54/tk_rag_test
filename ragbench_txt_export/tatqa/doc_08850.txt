The contingent consideration liability consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. At October 21, 2019, the fair value of the liability was $2.8 million. At each reporting date until the payment date in 2021, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach. Changes in the fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the contingent consideration liability decreased $0.2 million to $2.6 million as compared to the initial liability recorded at the acquisition date, primarily due to a change to OpenEye's 2020 projected revenue. The unobservable inputs used in the valuation as of December 31, 2019 included a revenue volatility of 45% and a discount rate of 3%. Selecting another revenue volatility or discount rate within an acceptable range would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.
