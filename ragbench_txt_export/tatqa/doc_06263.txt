Year 2019 compared with year 2018 R&D expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel-related costs for personnel involved in our research and development activities. Research and development expenses in 2019 increased by $15.7 million, or 22%, compared to 2018. This increase is primarily due to a $10.6 million increase in compensation and other personnel-related expenses, $3.0 million increase in performance-based compensation expense, and $1.7 million increase in computer infrastructure costs, resulting from increased headcount to support R&D activities.
