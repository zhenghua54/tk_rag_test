General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $788 or 5.8% to $12,828 during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $13,616 during the same period in 2018. The decrease is primarily a result of lower compensation expense due to organizational changes made in 2018, and lower professional fees, partially offset by increased legal expenses.
