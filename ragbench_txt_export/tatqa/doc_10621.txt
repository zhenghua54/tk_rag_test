Our operating income in fiscal year 2018 increased to $189.3 million, or 8.8 percent of net sales as compared with $121.5 million, or 6.8 percent in net sales in fiscal year 2017. Excluding surcharge revenue and special items, adjusted operating margin was 10.6 percent for the fiscal year 2018 and 8.0 percent for fiscal year 2017. The increase in the operating margin reflects the stronger demand and improved product mix coupled with operating cost improvements partially offset by higher variable compensation expense compared to fiscal year 2017.
