The Groupâ€™s policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements during the year. During the year ended 30 June 2019 the Group transferred $2.1m from level 3 to level 2 following the reclassification of assets from freehold investment properties to assets held for sale, and $5.7m from level 2 to level 3 following the reclassification of assets from assets held for sale to freehold investment properties, as detailed in note 10.2.
