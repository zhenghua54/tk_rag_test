The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase shares by authorizing payroll deductions from 1% to 10% of his or her eligible compensation during an offering period, a duration of six months. Unless an employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be used to purchase shares on the last day of the offering period at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the shares on the first business day or last business day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
