Cash flow from operating activities before interest and tax was $3,858 million, an increase of 0.5% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of significant items, higher EBITDA was offset by the impact of the New Zealand payment run in week 53 and a movement in provisions and accruals. The cash flow benefit from an extra week of trading is offset by nine months of EBITDA from the Petrol business compared to a full year in F18.
