In July 2016, we implemented a reorganization of our subsidiaries worldwide with the view to continuing to enhance operational and administrative efficiencies through further consolidated ownership, management, and development of our intellectual property (IP) in Canada, continuing to reduce the number of entities in our group and working towards our objective of having a single operating legal entity in each jurisdiction. A significant tax benefit of $876.1 million, associated primarily with the recognition of a net deferred tax asset arising from the entry of the IP into Canada, was recognized in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. For more information relating to this, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.
