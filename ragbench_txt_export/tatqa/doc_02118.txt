We review our internal calculation of WACC annually. Our WACC was 9.0% for fiscal year 2019 and 9.5% for fiscal year 2018. By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2019 ROIC of 13.1% reflects an Economic Return of 4.1%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.0%, and fiscal 2018 ROIC of 16.1% reflects an Economic Return of 6.6%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% for that fiscal year.
