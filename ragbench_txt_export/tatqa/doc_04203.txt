For fiscal 2018, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act reform. The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038.
