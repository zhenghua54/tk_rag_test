This amount is in excess of the carrying amount of the Groupâ€™s net assets at 30 June 2019 which includes the contract for future issue of equity recognised as contributed equity within the statement of financial position at this date (see note 13). Had the security price decreased by 2.5% the market capitalisation would still have been in excess of the carrying amount.
