Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.6% (4.3% in constant currency) as a result of: • an increase in the American broadband services segment mainly as a result of strong organic growth combined with the impact of the FiberLight acquisition; and • an increase in the Canadian broadband services segment resulting mainly from a decline in operating expenses.
