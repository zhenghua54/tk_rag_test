The fair value of the rights at the date of valuation was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to be equal to the volume weighted-average price (VWAP) ending on the day before the grant date, less the dividends expected over the period from the expected grant date to the completion of the measurement period, adjusted for the expected probability of achieving the vesting conditions.
