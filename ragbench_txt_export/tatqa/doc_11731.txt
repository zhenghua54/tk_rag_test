Liabilities in the combined schemes increased by £121.0m in the year to £4,667.6m. The value of liabilities associated with the RHM scheme were £3,495.8m, an increase of £65.3m while liabilities in the Premier Foods schemes were £55.7m higher at £1,171.8m. The increase in the value of liabilities in both schemes is due to a lower discount rate assumption of 2.45% (31 March 2018: 2.70%) and an increase in the RPI inflation rate assumption; from 3.15% to 3.25%.
