As at 31 December 2019, the Group had net debt of RMB15,552 million, compared to net debt of RMB7,173 million as at 30 September 2019. The sequential increase in indebtedness mainly reflected payments for M&A initiatives and media contents, as well as the consolidation of indebtedness at Halti, partly offset by strong free cash flow generation.
