Provisions are measured at the present value of managementâ€™s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date using the discounted cash flow methodology. The risks specific to the provision are factored into the cash flows and as such a corporate bond rate relative to the expected life of the provision is used as a discount rate. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
