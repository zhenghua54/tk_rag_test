As discussed in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, we characterize certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2019 were $1,457 million, a decrease of $37 million compared to 2018. Non-operating costs of $615 million in 2019 decreased $957 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.
