At December 31, 2019, we had state and foreign net operating losses of approximately $12.2 million and $7.9 million, respectively. The state net operating losses expire beginning 2027 through 2038. We recorded a full valuation allowance against the foreign net operating losses and a partial valuation allowance against the state net operating losses, as we do not believe those losses will be fully utilized in the future.
