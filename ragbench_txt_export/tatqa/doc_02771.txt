At March 31, 2019 our India subsidiary had $0.4 million of minimum alternative tax credits reported as other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our India subsidiary operates in a “Special Economic Zone (“SEZ”)”. One of the benefits associated with the SEZ is that the India subsidiary is not subject to regular India income taxes during its first 5 years of operations. The aggregate value of the benefit of the SEZ during the current fiscal year is $0.5 million.
