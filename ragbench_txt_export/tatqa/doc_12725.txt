Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.3%, including a 5.1 percentage point negative impact from the deconsolidation of Vodafone Netherlands and a 0.6 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange movements. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 13.0%*, supported by the benefit of the introduction of handset financing in the UK, regulatory settlements in the UK and a legal settlement in Germany. Excluding these items, as well as the net impact of roaming, adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.9*, reflecting operating leverage and tight cost control through our “Fit for Growth” programme.
