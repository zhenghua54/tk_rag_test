In order to protect our manufacturing partners from losses in relation to AirBar production, we agreed to secure the value of the inventory with a bank guarantee. Since the sale of AirBars has been lower than expected, a major part of the inventory at the partner remained unused when the due date of the bank guarantee neared and Neonode therefore agreed that the partner should keep inventory for the production of 20,000 AirBars and the rest be purchased by us. The inventory value of these purchases has been fully reserved.
