Revenue for a period is calculated from information received through ICSâ€™s billing software, such as minutes and market rates. Customized billing software has been implemented to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates. This software provides ICS with the ability to perform a timely and accurate analysis of revenue earned in a period.
