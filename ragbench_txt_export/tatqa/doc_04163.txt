Effective from fiscal year 2014 through 2017, the Company had a tax ruling in Switzerland for one of its foreign subsidiaries. The impact of the tax ruling decreased taxes by approximately $6.3 million for fiscal year 2017. The benefit of the tax ruling on diluted earnings per share was approximately $0.03 in fiscal year 2017. Effective fiscal year 2018, the Company has withdrawn its reduced tax rate ruling in Switzerland for this subsidiary due to the ruling being no longer necessary as the subsidiary meets the requirements to achieve the reduced tax rate under Swiss tax law.
