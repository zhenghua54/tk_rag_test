The regional sales percentages of our total sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 decreased in the Asian region while increasing in the European and
American regions compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 reflective of the increased European sales activity resulting from our acquisitions. Sales in the
Asian, American, and European regions represented 31.4%, 27.1% and 41.5% of total sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. This compares to
37.2%, 25.6% and 37.2% of total sales for the Asian, American, and European regions in the prior year, respectively. As a result of the movement of the U.S. dollar
against certain foreign currencies, reported sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $33.3 million when compared to
the prior year.
