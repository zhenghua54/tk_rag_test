Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Energy segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $0.9 million to $4.9 million from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by an increase in salaries and benefits largely due to the of the acquisition of ampCNG stations, which were acquired late in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by a one-time expense in the prior year related to the abandonment of a station development project.
