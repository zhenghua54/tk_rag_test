Production
growth in the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries flattened
during the course of fiscal 2019, due in part to spillover effects from the automotive industry on related chemicals segments. The food and beverage industry grew modestly and global electronics and semiconductor production expanded but prices were under pressure. For fiscal 2020, the market environment for Digital Industries is expected to weaken further. Manufacturing investments are expected to decrease at least moderately but then begin to stabilize in the second half of fiscal 2020. An overall decline in investment sentiment caused by global trade tensions, among other factors, dampens short-term expectations and fuels increasing cautiousness for investments globally. A weakening of growth in China could lead to spillover effects in other Asian
countries and also in Europe.
