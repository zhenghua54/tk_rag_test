Prior to the Company’s IPO, the Company was given authorization by Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC (“CII”) to award 625,000,000 of CII’s common units as profits interests to employees, directors, and affiliates of the Company. The common units were historically considered to be stock-based compensation with terms that required the awards to be classified as liabilities due to cash settlement features. The vested portion of the awards was reported as a liability and the fair value was re-measured at each reporting date until the date of settlement, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock-based compensation expense. On December 31, 2016, the CII common units became fully vested and as such there is no remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with CII common units for any period subsequent to December 31, 2016.
