The Act also established new tax provisions that became effective in fiscal year 2019, including but not limited to eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation, creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) and generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period expense when incurred.
