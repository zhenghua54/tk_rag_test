Revenues from VAS increased by 3% to RMB52,308 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Online games revenues grew by 6% to RMB30,286 million. The increase was primarily due to revenue contributions from domestic smart phone titles such as Peacekeeper Elite, as well as revenues contributed from Supercell commencing in the fourth quarter of 2019, partly offset by the decrease in revenues from PC client games. Social networks revenues were RMB22,022 million, broadly stable compared to the third quarter of 2019.
