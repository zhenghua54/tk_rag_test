In relation to the oil derivative instrument (see note 24), the fair value was determined using the estimated discounted cash flows of the additional payments due to us as a result of oil prices moving above a contractual oil price floor over the term of the liquefaction tolling agreement ("LTA"). Significant inputs used in the valuation of the oil derivative instrument include managementâ€™s estimate of an appropriate discount rate and the length of time to blend the long-term and the short-term oil prices obtained from quoted prices in active markets. The changes in fair value of our oil derivative instrument is recognized in each period in current earnings in "Realized and unrealized gain on oil derivative instrument" as part of the consolidated statement of income.
