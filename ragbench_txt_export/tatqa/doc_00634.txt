With respect to our undistributed foreign subsidiariesâ€™ earnings we consider those earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no related provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided. Our intention has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the Tax Act. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes in the various countries. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the undistributed earnings approximated $13.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively. Our undistributed earnings through December 31, 2017 have been taxed under the one-time transition tax under the Tax Act.
