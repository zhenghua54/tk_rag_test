Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. The Company does not expect the limitation to result in a reduction in the total amount utilizable.
