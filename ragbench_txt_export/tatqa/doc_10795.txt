On a geographic basis,
Siemens Healthineers expects markets in the region Asia, Australia to be the major growth driver. For China, Siemens Healthineers expects continuing strong growth due to rising government spending on healthcare, promotion of the private segment and wider access to healthcare services nationwide, pronounced effects of an aging population, and a growing incidence of chronic diseases. Growth in the U. S. is expected to be held back by continued pressure to increase utilization of existing equipment, reduced reimbursement rates and uncertainty about policies. For Europe, Siemens Healthineers expects slight growth, with a likely increased emphasis on equipment replacement and business with large customers such as hospital chains.
