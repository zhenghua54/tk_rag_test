Management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize state tax carryforwards of $1.8 million and related deferred tax asset of $1.5 million and has placed a valuation allowance on this amount. The related state tax credit carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2024. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.
