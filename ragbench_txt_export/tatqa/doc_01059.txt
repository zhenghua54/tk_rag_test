The Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (‘‘GILTI’’) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In general, this income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate reduced by any available current year foreign tax credits. This provision became effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, which was our fiscal 2019. We have elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.
