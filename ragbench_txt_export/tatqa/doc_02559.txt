Restructuring costs — Restructuring charges include costs resulting from the exploration of strategic alternatives (the “Strategic Alternatives Evaluation”) in 2019, and a plan that management initiated to reduce our general and administrative costs. Restructuring charges in 2018 also include costs related to the evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to the Qdoba brand (the “Qdoba Evaluation”), which resulted in the Qdoba Sale. Refer to Note 10, Discontinued Operations, for information regarding the Qdoba Sale.
