In 2018, the $3.3 million of net cash used in operating activities consisted of our net income of $11.0 million and included a gain recognized on the sale of our optoelectronic segment that was sold in July 2018 of $8.6 million in addition to non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $1.2 million and stock-based compensation of $0.6 million, offset by a net cash outflow of $7.6 million from changes in working capital. The changes in working capital were principally driven by an increase in inventory of $1.0 million, and increase in accounts receivable of $6.2 million, and increase in contract assets of $0.8 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $0.5 million, all partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in other assets.
