Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, but where invoicing is delayed until the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
