SG&A expense was $42.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended June 1, 2019, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 14.8%,
compared to $49.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended June 2, 2018. The decrease in specialty egg expense for the
fiscal 2019 fourth quarter is attributable to the timing of advertising and promotions as well as a decrease in specialty
egg dozens sold resulting in decreased franchise expense. Payroll and overhead decreased $526,000, or 5.2%, compared
to the same period of last year due to timing of bonus accruals. Stock compensation expense relates to the amortization
of compensation expense for grants of restricted stock and is dependent on the closing prices of the Company's stock
on the grant dates. The weighted average grant date fair value of our restricted stock awards at June 1, 2019, was
$43.20, a 2.1% increase over the value of $42.30 at June 2, 2018. Other expenses decreased 27.6% from $8.4 million
for the thirteen weeks ended June 2, 2018 to $6.1 million for the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to a reduction
in the liability for incurred but not reported insurance claims at June 1, 2019 as well as a reduction in legal expenses.
