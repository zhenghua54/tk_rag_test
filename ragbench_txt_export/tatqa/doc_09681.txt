CAPITAL INTENSITY AND ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Fiscal 2019 acquisitions of property, plant and equipment decreased by 9.4% (12.4% in constant currency) mainly due to: • the acquisition of several dark fibres throughout south Florida from FiberLight, LLC for a consideration of $21.2 million (US$16.8 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2018; partly offset by • additional capital expenditures related to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition; and • additional capital expenditures related to the expansion in Florida. Fiscal 2019 capital intensity reached 18.6% compared to 25.1% for fiscal 2018 mainly as a result of lower capital expenditures combined with revenue growth.
