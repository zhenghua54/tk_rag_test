We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (“Qualified Plan”) covering substantially all full-time employees hired before January 1, 2011.  Our policy is to fund our Qualified Plan at amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum amount required by law, plus additional amounts as determined by management to improve the plan’s funded status. Contributions beyond fiscal 2019 will depend on pension asset performance, future interest rates, future tax law changes, and future changes in regulatory funding requirements. Based on the funding status of our Qualified Plan as of our last measurement date, there was no minimum contribution required in 2019. For additional information related to our pension plans, refer to Note 12,Retirement Plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
