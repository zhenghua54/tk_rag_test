The interest rate is based, at the Company’s election, on either the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Eurodollar Rate” means the reserve adjusted rate at which Eurodollar
deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three, six or twelve months (as selected by
the Company) are quoted. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the administrative agent, and (c) the Table of Contents 54 Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1% per annum, subject to certain interest rate floors. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00% to 0.75% per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00% to 1.75% per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case depending upon the average outstanding balance at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee of 0.20% on the unused portion of the facility.
