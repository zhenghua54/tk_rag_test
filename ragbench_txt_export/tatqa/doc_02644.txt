We used $13.5 million in operating cash during 2019, compared to $5.2 million of operating cash in 2018. We also funded $4.4 million of capital expenditures in 2019, compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. These capital expenditures relate primarily to our capacity expansion and debottlenecking at Golden Ridge, leasehold improvements at our Riverside facility, and our specialty ingredientsâ€™ equipment in our Dillon plant. Offsetting these uses of cash was $19.4 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock and a prefunded warrant, as well as $2.2 million of proceeds from option and warrant exercises.
