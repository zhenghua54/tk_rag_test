Our income tax expense is the sum of current and deferred income tax expenses. Current income tax expense is calculated on accounting profit after adjusting for non-taxable and non-deductible items based on rules set by the tax authorities. Deferred income tax expense is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Both our current and deferred income tax expenses are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.
