Cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 totaled $291.8 as compared to $339.0 at December 31, 2018, a decrease of 13.9%. The decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $290.6 during the year and cash used in the acquisition of Foundry, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. We intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax.
