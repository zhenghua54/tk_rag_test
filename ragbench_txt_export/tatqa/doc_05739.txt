Repayment of 5.900% Senior Notes—On January 15, 2020, we redeemed all of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.900% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “5.900% Notes”) at a price equal to 106.7090% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding January 15, 2020, for an aggregate redemption price of $539.6 million, including $6.1 million in accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $34.6 million, which includes prepayment consideration of $33.5 million and the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing costs. The redemption was funded with borrowings from the 2019 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Upon completion of the repayment, none of the 5.900% Notes remained outstanding.
