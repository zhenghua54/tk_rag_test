During 2016 fiscal year and through February 22, 2017, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ACUR”. On February 23, 2017, our common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market due to our failure to comply with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires that we maintain $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity for continued listing (or meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities of $35 million or net income from continuing operations). NASDAQ had granted us a grace period through February 10, 2017, to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), but we were unable to regain compliance within such period.
