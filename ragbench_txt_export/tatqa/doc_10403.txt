Revenue grew slightly as double-digit growth in the customer services business was largely offset by a decline in the rail infrastructure business. Revenue in the rolling stock business remained close to the prior-year level due to unfavorable timing effects related to the execution of large rail projects, which the business began to ramp up late in the fiscal year. Mobility continued to operate with high profitability in fiscal 2019, including a strong contribution to Adjusted EBITA from the services business. Severance charges were € 20 million, up from € 14 million in fiscal 2018. Mobility’s order backlog was € 33 billion at the end of the fiscal year, of which € 8 billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal 2020.
