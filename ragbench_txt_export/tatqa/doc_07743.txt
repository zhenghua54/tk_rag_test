In December 2017, an Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act included provisions that reduced the federal statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, created a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings (i.e. transition tax), and changed certain business deductions including allowing for immediate expensing of certain qualified capital expenditures and limitations on deductions of interest expense. The SEC staff issued guidance on income tax accounting for the Act which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. In accordance with this guidance, during fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge of $5.0 million for the transition tax and a provisional tax benefit of $74.6 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. During fiscal year 2019, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $0.2 million in measurement period adjustments for the transition tax offset by a discrete tax charge of $0.2 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our accounting for the impact of the Act was completed as of the period ending December 31, 2018. Under the Act, the transition tax is being paid over an eight year period beginning in fiscal year 2019.
