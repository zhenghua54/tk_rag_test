The fair value of stock options granted are principally estimated using a binomial-lattice model. The inputs in our binomial-lattice model include expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, contractual term, and vesting schedule, as well as measures of employeesâ€™ cancellations, exercise, and post-vesting termination behavior. Statistical methods are used to estimate employee termination rates.
