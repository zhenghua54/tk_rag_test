The Company intends to distribute all historical unremitted foreign earnings up to the amount of excess foreign cash, as well as all future foreign earnings that can be repatriated without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. Any remaining outside basis differences relating to the Companyâ€™s investments in foreign subsidiaries are no longer expected to be material and will be indefinitely reinvested.
