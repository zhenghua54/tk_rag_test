We target markets that have the potential for above-average growth and profit margins where domain expertise, innovation, technical competency and contracting dynamics can help to create meaningful barriers to entry. We will strategically reinvest our cash in key program captures, internal research and development (R&D), and acquisitions to target priority markets and help ensure market leading positions to drive long-term shareholder return.
