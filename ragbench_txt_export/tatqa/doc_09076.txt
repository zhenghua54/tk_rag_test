The Company estimates the fair value of employee share options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of highly subjective estimates and assumptions. The Company estimates the expected term of share options for service-based awards utilizing the “Simplified Method,” as it does not have sufficient historical share option exercise information on which to base its estimate. The Simplified Method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant.
