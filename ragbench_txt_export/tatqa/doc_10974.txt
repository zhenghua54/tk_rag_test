Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average basic shares excludes 300,437, 334,817 and 490,355 of restricted shares and performance shares at March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as these shares were issued but were not vested and, therefore, not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic earnings per share at the balance sheet dates.
