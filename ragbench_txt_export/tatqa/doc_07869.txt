Our fleet currently consists of 23 Suezmax crude oil tankers, of which the vast majority have been built in Korea. The majority of our vessels are employed in the spot market, together with one vessel currently on a longer term time charter agreement expiring in 2021 or later. The vessels are considered homogenous and interchangeable as they have approximately the same freight capacity and ability to transport the same type of cargo.
