Trail commissions are ongoing fees for customers referred to individual product providers or who have applied for mortgages via iSelect. Trail commission revenue represents commission earned calculated as a percentage of the value of the underlying policy relationship to the expected life and, in the case of mortgages, a proportion of the underlying value of the loan. The Group is entitled to receive trail commission without having to perform further services. On initial recognition, trail revenue and assets are recognised at expected value and subject to constraints.
