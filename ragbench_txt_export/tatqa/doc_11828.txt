There was a cash outflow, including fees, of £137.6 million on the acquisition of Thermocoax, as well as an additional £0.9 million outflow relating to the acquisition of various distribution rights. The net of share purchases and new shares issued for the Group’s various employee share schemes gave a cash outflow of £12.5 million (2018: £5.0 million) reflecting the move to acquire shares on the open market rather than issue new equity.
