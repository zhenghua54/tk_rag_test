Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 118, which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded a reasonable estimate when measurable and with the understanding that the provisional amount was subject to further adjustments under SAB 118. In addition, for significant items for which the Company could not make a reasonable estimate, no provisional amounts were recorded. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its review of the previously recorded provisional amounts related to the Act, recorded necessary adjustments, and the amounts are now final under SAB 118.
