In February 2016, we granted 547,000 PSUs with certain financial and operational targets. Actual performance,
as measured at the time and prior to the restatement of the 2016 financial statements, resulted in participants
achieving 80% of target. Given the PSUs did not contain explicit or implicit claw back rights, there was no change
to stock-based compensation expense for the impact of the previously disclosed restatement of the 2016 consolidated
financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, 253,203 shares had vested, 200,297 shares had been forfeited, and
the remaining 93,500 shares will vest (as to 80%) in annual tranches through February 2020 subject to continued
service vesting requirements
