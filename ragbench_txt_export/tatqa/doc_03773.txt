(4) Our operating leases are for office space. Certain of these leases contain provisions for rent escalations and/or lease concessions. Rental payments, as well as any step rent provisions specified in the lease agreements, are aggregated and charged evenly to expense over the lease term. However, amounts included herein do not reflect this accounting treatment, as they represent the future contractual lease cash obligations.
