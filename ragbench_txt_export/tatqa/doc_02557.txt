Amounts owed to subsidiaries are classified and recorded at amortised cost (2018: classified as loans and receivables) and reduced by allowances for expected credit losses. Estimate future credit losses are first recorded on initial recognition of a receivable and are based on estimated probability of default. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
