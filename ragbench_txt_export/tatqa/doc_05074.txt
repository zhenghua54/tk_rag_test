In 2019, it was determined that the foreign tax credit carryforward of the Company would not be realizable. The reduction of the foreign tax credit carryforward resulted in a decrease in the valuation allowance for those credits. Therefore, there is no net income tax provision in 2019 related to the reduction in the foreign tax credit carryforward. A valuation allowance is required to the extent it is more likely than not that the future benefit associated with certain Federal and state tax loss carryforwards will not be realized.
