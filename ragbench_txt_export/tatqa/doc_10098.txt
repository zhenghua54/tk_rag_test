In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom businessâ€™ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.55 billion as of fiscal year end 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire by fiscal year end 2020. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. At fiscal year end 2019, there were no such new performance guarantees outstanding. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.
