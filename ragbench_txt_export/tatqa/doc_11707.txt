Net revenue: Net revenue from our Energy segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $18.3 million to $39.0 million from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the AFTC related to the 2018 and 2019 CNG sales that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, inclusive of prior period AFTC at the acquired ampCNG stations which was also recognized in 2019. The increase was also driven by higher volume-related revenues from the recent acquisition of the ampCNG stations and growth in CNG sales volumes.
