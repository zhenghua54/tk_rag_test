Our CODM evaluates each segment based on Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), and we therefore consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a primary measure of operating performance of our operating segments. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before investment income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation and other adjustments as identified below. The adjustments to our financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to calculate Adjusted EBITDA are itemized below (in thousands): [["", "", "Year Ended February 28,", ""], ["", "2019", "2018", "2017"], ["Net income (loss)", "$18,398", "$16,617", "$(7,904)"], ["Investment income", "(5,258)", "(2,256)", "(1,691)"], ["Interest expense", "16,726", "10,280", "9,896"], ["Income tax provision (benefits)", "(1,330)", "10,681", "(1,563)"], ["Depreciation and amortization", "20,016", "22,957", "23,469"], ["Stock-based compensation", "11,029", "9,298", "7,833"], ["Impairment loss and equity in net loss of affiliate", "6,787", "1,411", "1,284"], ["Loss on extinguishment of debt", "2,033", "-", "-"], ["Acquisition and integration related expenses", "935", "-", "4,513"], ["Non-recurring legal expenses, net of reversal of litigation", "", "", ""], ["provision", "(11,020)", "10,738", "9,192"], ["Gain on LoJack battery performance legal Settlement", "(18,333)", "(28,333)", "-"], ["Restructuring", "8,015", "-", "-"], ["Other", "217", "989", "4,339"], ["Adjusted EBITDA", "$48,215", "$52,382", "$49,368"]]
