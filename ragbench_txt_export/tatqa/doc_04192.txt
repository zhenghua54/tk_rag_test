REVENUE Fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter revenue increased by 7.0% (6.0% in constant currency). In local currency, revenue amounted to US$199.5 million compared to US$188.1 million for the same period of fiscal 2018. The increase resulted mainly from: • rate increases; • activation of bulk properties in Florida during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019; • continued growth in Internet service customers; and • the FiberLight acquisition completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019; partly offset by • a decrease in video service customers.
