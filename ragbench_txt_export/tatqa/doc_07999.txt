Deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2019 include state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately$27.4 million expiring at various times between 2020 and 2038. At September 29, 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance of$2.5 million related to losses and state tax credits, which decreased from the$3.6 million at September 30, 2018 primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on prior year net operating losses. We believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss and credit carry-forwards will not be realized and that all other deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income or alternative tax strategies.
