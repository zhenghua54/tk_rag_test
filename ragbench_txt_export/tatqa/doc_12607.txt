Teekay LNG owns a 70% ownership interest in Teekay BLT Corporation (or the Teekay Tangguh Joint Venture), which is a party to operating leases whereby the Teekay Tangguh Joint Venture leases two LNG carriers (or the Tangguh LNG Carriers) to a third party, which in turn leases the vessels back to the joint venture. The time charters for the two Tangguh LNG carriers are accounted for as direct financing leases. The Tangguh LNG Carriers commenced their time charters with their charterers in 2009.
