Restricted cash primarily consists of interest-bearing escrow accounts that are required under the terms of the contracts with our Bank Partners. Restricted cash is typically comprised of three components: (i) amounts we have escrowed with Bank Partners as limited protection to the Bank Partners in the event of excess Bank Partner portfolio credit losses; (ii) additional amounts we maintain for certain Bank Partners based on a contractual percentage of the total interest billed on outstanding deferred interest loans that are within the promotional period less previous finance charge reversal ("FCR") settlements on such outstanding loans; and (iii) certain custodial intransit loan funding and consumer borrower payments that we are restricted from using for our operations. These custodial balances are not considered in our evaluation of restricted cash usage. As it relates to our restricted cash escrowed with Bank Partners, we record a liability for the amount of restricted cash we expect to be payable to our Bank Partners, which is accounted for as a financial guarantee. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.
