Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Life Sciences segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.0 million to $8.6 million from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was driven by comparably fewer expenses at the Pansend holding company, which incurred additional compensation expense in the prior period related to the performance of the segment. The decrease was also due to a reduction in costs associated with the sale of BeneVir in the second quarter of 2018.
