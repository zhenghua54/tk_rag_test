Expected Term—The Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, the Company used the simplified method to calculate the expected term, which is equal to the average of the stock-based award’s weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of the 2015 ESPP was based on the contractual term.
