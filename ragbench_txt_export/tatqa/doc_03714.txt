In prior years, Singtel had sold certain infrastructure assets, namely ducts, manholes and exchange buildings (“Assets”) to NLT. At the consolidated level, the gain on disposal of Assets recognised by Singtel is deferred in the Group’s statement of financial position and amortised over the useful lives of the Assets. The unamortised deferred gain is released to the Group’s income statement when NLT is partially or fully sold, based on the proportionate equity interest disposed.
