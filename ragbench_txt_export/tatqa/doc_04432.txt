Fair values are determined by a combination of independent valuations and Director valuations. The independent valuations are performed by an accredited independent valuer. Investment properties are independently valued on a rotational basis every three years unless the underlying financing requires a more frequent valuation cycle. For properties subject to an independent valuation report the Directors verify all major inputs to the valuation and review the results with the independent valuer. The Director valuations are completed by the NSH Group Board. The valuations are determined using the same techniques and similar estimates to those applied by the independent valuer.
