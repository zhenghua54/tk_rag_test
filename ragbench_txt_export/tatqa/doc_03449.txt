The longer the duration of marketable securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. We anticipate recovering the full cost of the securities either as market conditions improve, or as the securities mature. Accordingly, we believe that the unrealized losses are not other-than-temporary.
