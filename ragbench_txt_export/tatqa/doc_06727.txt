2018 vs. 2017. We had net cash used in investing activities of $6.6 million during 2018 compared to $4.1 million during 2017. The higher spend in 2018 was primarily related to an increase in software expenditures, most of which were capitalized costs related to internally-developed software, which consisted primarily of merchant experience enhancements and mobile application development. This activity was partially offset by lower infrastructure expenditures in 2018 compared to 2017, as we did not have any material changes to our leased premises during 2018.
