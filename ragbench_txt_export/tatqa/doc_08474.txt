Net cash provided by operating activities was $466.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, as a result of $605.6 million in loss before income tax expense adjusted by non-cash charges including the loss of marking to fair value of the embedded exchange feature of the Notes and related capped call transactions of $533.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $70.2 million, share-based payment expense of $257.8 million and debt discount and issuance cost amortization of $33.9 million. The net increase of $169.0 million from our operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $122.5 million increase in our deferred revenue as a result of increased sales of subscriptions and renewals of maintenance contracts and a $75.6 million increase in trade and other payables, provisions and other non-current liabilities, offset by a $30.2 million increase in trade receivables. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by tax refunds received, net of income tax paid of $7.0 million.
