The backlog includes orders for which purchase orders or letters of intent have been accepted, typically for up to one year. Historically, orders have been subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers. In addition, orders have been subject to price negotiations and changes in specifications as a result of changes in customersâ€™ requirements. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and requirements, and to cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any subsequent period.
