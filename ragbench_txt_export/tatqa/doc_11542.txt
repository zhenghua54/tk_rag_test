Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $5.0 million to $23.5 million from $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The overall decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in audience measurement costs as a result of the exit of certain local markets which were unprofitable at Network and a decrease in programming costs due to changes in the programming mix referenced above, partially offset by higher cost of revenues associated with the growth of the Broadcast stations subsequent to the prior year.
