Grocery & Snacks operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $724.8 million, an increase of $69.4 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2017. Gross profits were $21.9 million lower in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. The lower gross profit was driven by investments with retailers (i.e., trade spending reflected as a reduction of net sales), as well as higher input costs and transportation expenses, partially offset by supply chain realized productivity. The Frontera acquisition, Thanasi acquisition, and the acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, which occurred in September 2016, April 2017, and October 2017, respectively, contributed $47.4 million to Grocery & Snacks gross profit during fiscal 2018 through the one-year anniversaries of the acquisitions (if reached). Advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal 2018 decreased by $19.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by charges totaling $4.0 million in fiscal 2018 for the impairment of our HK Anderson® , Red Fork® , and Salpica® brand assets and $68.3 million in fiscal 2017 primarily for the impairment of our Chef Boyardee® brand asset. Grocery & Snacks also incurred $11.4 million of expenses in fiscal 2018 related to acquisitions and divestitures, charges of $31.4 million in fiscal 2017 related to the pending divestiture of the Wesson® oil business, and charges of $14.1 million and $23.6 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
