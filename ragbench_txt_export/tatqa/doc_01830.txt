The shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant
loss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the
periods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically,
demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results
fluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the
blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year
primarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels
exceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In
fiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased
over prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half
of the fiscal year. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019.
