(i) Timing of revenue recognition for uninstalled materials - The Company previously recognized the majority of its revenue from the installation or construction of commercial & public works projects using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, whereby revenue is recognized as the Company progresses on the contract. The percentage-of-completion for each project was determined on an actual cost-to-estimated final cost basis. Under ASC 606, revenue and associated profit, is recognized as the customer obtains control of the goods and services promised in the contract (i.e., performance obligations). The cost of uninstalled materials or equipment is generally excluded from the Companyâ€™s recognition of profit, unless specifically produced or manufactured for a project, because such costs are not considered to be a measure of progress.
