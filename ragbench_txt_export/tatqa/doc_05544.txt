Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $27.4 million to $117.8 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $145.2 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $43.6 million of cash inflows for operating assets and liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower prepaid expenses and other assets, offset by higher inventory levels.
