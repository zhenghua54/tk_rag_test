In December 2017, the Group made changes to its corporate structure to include certain foreign subsidiaries in its U.S. consolidated tax group that resulted in the creation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, including a non-recognized deferred tax asset of $2.1 billion related to the fair market value of its intellectual property. The assets are included in the Groupâ€™s quarterly assessment and are only recognized to the extent they are determined to be realizable.
