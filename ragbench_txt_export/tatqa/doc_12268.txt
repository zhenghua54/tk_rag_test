Fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 8.6% (6.8% in constant currency) resulting from: • a growth in the American broadband services segment mainly due to the impact of the MetroCast acquisition which was included in revenue for only an eight-month period in the prior year combined with strong organic growth and the acquisition of the south Florida fibre network previously owned by FiberLight, LLC (the "FiberLight acquisition"); partly offset by • a decrease in the Canadian broadband services segment mainly as a result of: ◦ a decline in primary service units in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 from lower service activations primarily due to issues resulting from the implementation of a new customer management system; partly offset by ◦ rate increases; and ◦ higher net pricing from consumer sales.
