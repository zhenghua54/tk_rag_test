Openreach has a UK-wide presence which is overlapped by our competitors in around half the country. This overlap is expected to grow as alternative network providers build-out new fibre footprint. Our volume discount deal, signed with the majority of our major communications provider customers, has led to another record quarter for fibre sales. We are also rapidly expanding our fibre-to-the-premises network to provide the next generation of services for our customers. We have experienced strong demand from businesses for Ethernet circuits for the second consecutive quarter.
