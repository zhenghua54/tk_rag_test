Telecommunication - Maintenance & Installation GMSL performs its services within telecommunication market primarily under fixed-price contracts and recognizes revenue over time using the input method to measure progress for its projects. The nature of the projects does not provide measurable value to the customer over time and control does not transfer to the customer at discrete points in time. The customer receives value over the term of the project based on the amount of work that has been completed towards the delivery of the completed project. Depending on the project, the most reliable measure of progress is either the cost incurred or time elapsed towards delivery of the completed project. Therefore, the input method provides the most reliable method to measure progress. Revenue recognition begins when work has commenced. Costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance, indirect labor, and overhead costs, which are charged to contract costs as incurred. Revisions in estimates during the course of contract work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts requiring the revision become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period a loss on a contract becomes determinable.
