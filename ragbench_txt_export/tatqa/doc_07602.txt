During the first quarter of 2019, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of the divestiture of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018, the evolution of the healthcare IT industry and our increased focus on the payer and life sciences market. As a result, we changed the presentation of our reportable segments to Provider and Veradigm. The new Provider segment is comprised of our core integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions targeted at clients across the entire continuum of care. The new Veradigm segment primarily focuses on the payer and life sciences market. These changes to our reportable segments had no impact on operating segments. The segment disclosures below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been revised to our current presentation.
