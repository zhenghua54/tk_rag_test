Cash flows from operating activities of £11.1 million were £91.5 million lower than 2018, largely due to the reduction in underlying earnings of £65.9 million (see income statement section) and the early settlement of interest rate swaps of £52.4 million, partially offset by improvements in working capital of £32.2 million.
