For fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities of $455.6 million was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.
