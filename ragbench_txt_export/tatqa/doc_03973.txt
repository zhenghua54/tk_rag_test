Underlying EBITDA for the year was $55.8 million, 7.0% down on the $60.0 million in FY18. This resulted in an underlying EBITDA margin decline to 24.1% from 26.0% in FY18. Sigma only contributed a modest $0.1 million of EBITDA in June, which we do not see as representative of the business going forward. Excluding Sigma, the underlying EBITDA margin was 24.6%. This reduced margin was the direct result of the lower non-recurring revenue, as we were able to maintain operating expenses at the same level as FY18, even after the investment in the Vietnam Development Centre.
