Interest expense: Interest expense increased by $42.6 million to $101.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $59.3 million for the same period in 2017. In addition to higher LIBOR rates, this was primarily due to:
• $22.7 million increase in interest expense arising on the loan facilities of our consolidated lessor VIEs (refer to note 5 "Variable Interest Entities ("VIE")" of our consolidated financial statements included herein), in particular on the Hilli post-delivery sale and leaseback arrangement entered into during June 2018;
• $21.7 million lower capitalized interest on borrowing costs in relation to our investment in the Hilli FLNG conversion prior to acceptance of the vessel;
• $7.0 million increase in amortization of deferred financing costs in relation to the Hilli facility; and
• $1.4 million increase in interest expense in relation to the $402.5 million convertible bond issued in February 2017, resulting in a full year of interest incurred in 2018.
