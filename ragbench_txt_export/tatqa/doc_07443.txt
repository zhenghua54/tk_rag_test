During 2017 the Group incurred a £49.4 million share related charge in relation to its Spanish development partner Eurofund’s future interests in the share capital of the intu Costa del Sol development company. The positive impact of this share related charge on equity attributable to owners of intu properties plc is a credit to retained earnings of £49.4 million. Subsequent to 31 December 2019, the Group has received the final ratifications required for full planning to become effective and therefore we expect the positive impact on retained earnings to reverse, once these arrangements are formally concluded.
