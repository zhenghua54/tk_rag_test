Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $15.8 million to $102.0 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $117.8 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was due to lower cash generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. The $42.2 million of cash outflows for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to higher prepaid expenses and other assets and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses.
