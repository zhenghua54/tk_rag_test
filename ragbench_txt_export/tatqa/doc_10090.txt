We determined no material liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions existed as of December 31, 2019 or 2018, based on our analysis of tax positions taken on income tax returns filed. Although we believe the amounts reflected in our tax returns substantially comply with applicable U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax regulations, the respective taxing authorities may take contrary positions based on their interpretation of the law. A tax position successfully challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our provision or benefit for income taxes in the period in which a final determination is made.
