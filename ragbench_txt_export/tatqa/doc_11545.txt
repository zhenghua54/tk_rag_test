Other operating (income) expense: Other operating (income) expense from our Broadcasting segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.3 million to income of $3.0 million from expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by reimbursements from the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), partially offset by the impairment of FCC licenses during 2019 resulting from strategic discussions to abandon certain licenses.
