Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $11.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to (i) a decrease in commissions expense of $6.6 million, of which approximately $8.9 million is the net result of the Company capitalizing more commission expense under Topic 606, whereas previously, under Topic 605, such costs would have been expensed as incurred, (ii) a decrease in marketing expenses of $5.7 million and (iii) a decrease in travel and communication expenses of $1.1 million. These were partially offset by (i) an increase in bad debt expense of $3.5 million as certain low dollar receivables were provided for entirely as they became aged greater than one year. Overall, our sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased to approximately 18% from approximately 19% in the prior fiscal year.
