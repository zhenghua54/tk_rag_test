(2) On December 10, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $20.0 million of our outstanding common stock over the next 12 months. As of February 28, 2019, $10.0 million of the $20.0 million had been utilized. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
