For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $70.6 million. This was primarily as a result of our net loss of $124.8 million, which once adjusted for $158.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $35.7 million of amortization and depreciation, a $37.9 million increase in deferred income taxes, a $15.9 million increase of our provision for uncollectible merchant cash advances and loans, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $3.2 million, contributed $50.4 million of positive cash flows. Additional cash of $162.9 million resulted from the following increases in operating liabilities: $84.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to indirect taxes payable, payroll liabilities, and payment processing and interchange fees; $64.6 million in income tax assets and liabilities; $12.3 million in deferred revenue due to the growth in sales of our subscription solutions along with the acquisition of 6RS; and $1.5 million increase in net lease liabilities. These were offset by $142.8 million of cash used resulting from the following increases in operating assets: $74.2 million in merchant cash advances and loans as we continued to grow Shopify Capital; $56.2 million in trade and other receivables; and $12.4 million in other current assets driven primarily by an increase in prepaid expenses, forward contract assets designated for hedge accounting, and deposits.
