As lessee â€” We lease restaurants and other facilities, which generally have renewal clauses of 1 to 20 years exercisable at our option. In some instances, these leases have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined revenues. Many of our restaurant and other facility leases also have rent escalation clauses and require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. We also lease certain restaurant and office equipment. Minimum rental obligations are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the initial lease, plus lease option terms for certain locations.
