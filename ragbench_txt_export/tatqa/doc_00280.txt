During 2019 and 2018, we had interest rate swap agreements with aggregate average net outstanding notional amounts of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, with average fixed rates of approximately 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively. Short-term variable benchmark interest rates during these periods were generally less than 3.0% and, as such, we incurred realized losses of $8.3 million and $13.9 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the interest rate swap agreements.
