Franchise rental revenues increased $13.8 million, or 5.3%, in 2019 versus a year ago due primarily to an increase in the number of franchised restaurants and, to a lesser extent, an increase in franchise same-store sales. The increase in the number of restaurants leased or subleased from the Company due to our refranchising strategy, contributed additional rental revenues of $12.4 million in 2019.
