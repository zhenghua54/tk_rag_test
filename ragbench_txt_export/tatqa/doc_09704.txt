During fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, cash provided by operating activities totaled $131.7 million, $120.8 million, and $71.7 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2019, cash provided by operating activities was positively impacted by our net income of $206.6 million, a $7.7 million increase in accounts payable, and a $1.0 million decrease in accrued income taxes. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by a $70.6 million decrease in other operating liabilities, a $42.8 million increase in inventories, an $8.9 million increase in accounts receivable, and a $4.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in other operating liabilities was driven by a $46.3 million decrease in accruals for TOKIN anti-trust fines and a $7.8 million decrease in restructuring liabilities. The increase in inventory is due to increased customer demand.
