Our net income in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 was $18.4 million as compared to net income of $16.6 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to a $11.7 million increase in operating income, $3.0 million increase in investment income and $12.0 million decrease in income tax provision. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to $21.0 million decrease in general and administrative expense due to reduced legal provision and related costs as further discussed in Note 19 and partially offset by $8.0 million of restructuring expense.
