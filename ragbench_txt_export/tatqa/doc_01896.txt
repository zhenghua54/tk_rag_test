During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved a world-wide restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2018 Plan”) to support the Company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production. Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities. At the same time, Autodesk plans to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure, customer success, and construction. By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals. This world-wide restructuring plan included a reduction in force of approximately 11% of the Company’s workforce, or 1,027 employees, and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. By January 31, 2019, the personnel and facilities related actions included in this restructuring plan were substantially complete.
