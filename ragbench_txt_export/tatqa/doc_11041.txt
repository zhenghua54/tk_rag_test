Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings
may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to
those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.
