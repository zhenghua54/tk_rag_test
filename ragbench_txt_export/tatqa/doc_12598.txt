These awards are a mix of time-, market- and performance-based grants awarded to key employees and non-employee directors which vest over a range of periods of up to five-years. The market- and performance-based RSAs cliff vest, if at all, after the conclusion of a three-year performance period and vesting is subject to the award recipient’s continued service to the Company as of the vesting date. The number of performance-based RSAs that ultimately vest is based on the Company’s attainment of certain profitability and return on invested capital targets.
