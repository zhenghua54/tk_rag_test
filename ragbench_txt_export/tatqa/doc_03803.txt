Property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of furniture, computers, other office equipment, and leasehold improvements. We depreciate the cost of furniture, computers, and other office equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (five years for office equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures). Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2019, 2018, and 2017 was approximately $8.0 million, $8.6 million, and $9.1 million, respectively, and was included in “Depreciation and amortization” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
