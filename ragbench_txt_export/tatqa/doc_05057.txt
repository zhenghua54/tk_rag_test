Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 was $293.1 million, which included (i) $283.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our solar cell manufacturing capacity and costs associated with solar power systems, leased and to be leased; (ii) $18.6 million paid for investments in consolidated and unconsolidated investees; and (iii) $1.3 million purchase of marketable securities. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment in joint ventures of $6.0 million and a $3.8 million dividend from equity method investees.
