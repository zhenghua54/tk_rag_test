Deloitte was appointed as intu’s external auditor for the 2019 audit following approval at the 2019 AGM, succeeding PwC. Although it is still early into Deloitte’s tenure as intu’s external auditor, I am pleased that the transition of the external audit process has gone well. The Audit Committee has recommended that Deloitte be reappointed as external auditor at the 2020 AGM.
