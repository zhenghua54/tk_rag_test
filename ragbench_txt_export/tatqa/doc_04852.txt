Contract assets are initially recognised for revenue earned from comparison, purchase support and referral services, as receipt of consideration is conditional on successful completion of a purchase between the customers and the product providers. Upon completion of sale and acceptance by the customer and the provider, invoices are issued to the provider for the amount receivable. These amounts invoiced are reclassified from contract assets to trade receivables. The trade receivable balance represents the Groupâ€™s unconditional right to receive the cash.
