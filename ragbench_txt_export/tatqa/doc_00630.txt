Recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of these assets is more likely than not. Based
upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance and the recorded
cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $85.7 million and $78.7 million against the U.S. net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by $7.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively.
