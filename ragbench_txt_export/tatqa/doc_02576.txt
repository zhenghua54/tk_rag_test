(2) On August 1, 2019, $19.4 million was initially recorded within Other non-current liabilities in our preliminary opening balance sheet as disclosed in the table included in our third quarter 2019 Form 10-Q filing. This amount was related to the second installment payment of the deferred incentive compensation plan for Automated's European employees. As two payments were expected to be made within the first twelve months after acquisition, the amount related to the second payment should have been reflected in other current liabilities. The preliminary allocation as of August 1, 2019 now shows the second installment within other current liabilities.
