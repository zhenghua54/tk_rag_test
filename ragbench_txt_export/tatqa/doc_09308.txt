We believe that our $92.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have repaid $213.0 million of debt to date. The credit agreement permits the Company to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of $160.0 million (subject to adjustments for any voluntary prepayments), plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain secured leverage ratio and total leverage ratio tests.
