Capital additions increased by £19.0 million. The most significant addition in the year was the £15.7 million spend on the construction of a new purpose-built factory in the UK for Aflex Hose, which will consolidate the existing four locations into a single facility, giving capacity for future growth while increasing efficiencies and providing a dedicated production line for Pharmaceutical products.
