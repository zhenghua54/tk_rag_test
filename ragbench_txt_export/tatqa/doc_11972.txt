We have chosen to present a revenue intensity ratio as this is a relevant indicator of our growth and is aligned with our business strategy. The reduction in our GHG emissions is due to a reduction in the fuel emissions from our company car fleet, as the fleet has reduced. We have also reduced the amount of electricity we use, and this coupled with a decrease in BEIS conversion factors has also contributed to our Scope 2 reduction.
