report its direct and indirect greenhouse
gas (‘GHG’) emissions by the Companies Act

Regulations 2013. The greenhouse gas
reporting period is aligned to the financial
reporting year. The methodology used to
calculate our emissions is based on the
financial consolidation approach, as

Standard (Revised Edition). Emission
factors used are from UK government
(‘BEIS’) conversion factor guidance for
the year reported.
