The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The estimated fair value assigned to the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities were based on management's estimates and assumptions. The initial allocation of the purchase price was based on preliminary valuations and assumptions and is subject to change within the measurement period, including current and non-current income taxes payable and deferred taxes as additional information is received and tax returns are finalized. VMware expects to finalize the allocation of the purchase price within the measurement period. Management expects that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets will not be deductible for tax purposes.
