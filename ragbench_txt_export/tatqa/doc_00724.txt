Software and hardware revenue increased $3.5 million, or 76.8% from $4.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main contributing factor for this increase was the timing of a large DCX customer contract completed and recognized in the current year. Our software and hardware related revenue results experience fluctuations due to the timing of implementation completions for our DCX customers and our revenue recognition for those arrangements.
