For the year ended December 31, 2019, Fios revenues totaled $10.4 billion and increased $92 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2018. This increase was due to a 2.5% increase in Fios Internet connections, reflecting increased demand in higher broadband speeds, partially offset by a 5.1% decrease in Fios video connections, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top (OTT) offerings.
