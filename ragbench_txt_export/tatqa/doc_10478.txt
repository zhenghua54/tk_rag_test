Net Cash Used In Investing Activities. Our primary use of investing cash is for purchases of property and equipment. These amounts were $47.0 million, $49.9 million and $45.8 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The annual changes in purchases of property and equipment are primarily due to the timing and scope of our network expansion activities including geographic expansion and adding buildings to our network. In 2019, 2018 and 2017 we obtained $11.3 million, $9.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of network equipment and software in non-cash exchanges for notes payable under an installment payment agreement.
