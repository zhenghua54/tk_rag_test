Accounts receivable allowances reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances, including both losses for uncollectible accounts receivable and sales returns. We regularly review allowances by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customerâ€™s ability to pay.
