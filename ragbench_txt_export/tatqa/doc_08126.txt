Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 was $1,138.3 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 0.3%, compared to $1,141.9 million for fiscal 2018. Comparing fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018, average cost per dozen purchased from outside shell egg producers decreased while cost of feed ingredients and dozens produced increased. For the 2019 fiscal year we produced 84.4% of the eggs sold by us, as compared to 84.2% for the previous year. Feed cost for fiscal 2019 was $0.415 per dozen, compared to $0.394 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 5.3%. The increase in feed costs was primarily related to less favorable crop conditions in the south central U. S., which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations. The increase in feed cost per dozen resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $18.4 million for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018.
