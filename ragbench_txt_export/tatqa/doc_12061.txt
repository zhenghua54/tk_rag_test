Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years. At 31 December 2019, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of five years (2018: six years). The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid concentration of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by doing so prior to the contracted maturity date. The change in valuation of an asset used as security for a debt facility may impact the Groupâ€™s ability to refinance that debt facility at the same quantum as currently outstanding.
