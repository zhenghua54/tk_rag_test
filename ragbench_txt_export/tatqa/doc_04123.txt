On a consolidated basis, the Company has incurred operating losses and has recorded a full valuation allowance against its US, UK, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Brazil deferred tax assets for all periods to date and, accordingly, has not recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than a provision (benefit) for certain foreign and state income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiaries and branches of the Company provide intercompany services and are compensated on a cost-plus basis, and therefore, have incurred liabilities for foreign income taxes in their respective jurisdictions.
