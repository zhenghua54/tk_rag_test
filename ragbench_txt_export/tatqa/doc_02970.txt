On April 18, 2018, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Nova Global Supply & Services, LLC (Purchaser), an entity affiliated with GC Valiant, LP, under which we agreed to sell our CGD Services business to the Purchaser. We concluded that the sale of the CGD Services business met all of the required conditions for discontinued operations presentation in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Consequently, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a $6.9 million loss within discontinued operations, which was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the net assets of CGD Services less the estimated sales price in the stock purchase agreement less estimated selling costs.
