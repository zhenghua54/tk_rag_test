In the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we sold the land and buildings comprising our separate CTS campus in San Diego. We have entered into a lease with the buyer of this campus and CTS employees will continue to occupy this separate campus until the new buildings on our corporate campus are ready for occupancy in fiscal 2021. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we also sold land and buildings in Orlando, Florida and we are entering a lease for new space in Orlando to accommodate our employees and operations in Orlando. In connection with the sale of these real estate campuses we received total net proceeds of $44.9 million and recognized net gains on the sales totaling $32.5 million.
