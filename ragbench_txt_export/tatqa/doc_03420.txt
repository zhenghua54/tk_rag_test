Costs incurred in the development of internal-use software and software applications, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable compensation costs of employees devoted to specific software development, are capitalized as computer software costs. Costs incurred outside of the application development stage, or that are types of costs that do not meet the capitalization requirements, are expensed as incurred. Amounts capitalized are included in property, plant and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three to seven years. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use.
