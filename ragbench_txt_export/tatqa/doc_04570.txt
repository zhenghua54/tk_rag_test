Selling, general and administrative: Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.9 million to $79.8 million from $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to headcount-driven increases in salary and benefits and an increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018.
