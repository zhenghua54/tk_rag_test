Goodwill acquired during fiscal 2019 totaled $17,015, with $12,893 of that resulting from the purchase of BOLTS Technologies, Inc., $3,999 resulting from the purchase of Agiletics, Inc., and the remainder resulting from a measurement period adjustment on the Ensenta valuation. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions consists largely of the growth potential, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with those of BOLTS Technologies and Agiletics, together with the value of their assembled workforces. No goodwill was assigned to the Companyâ€™s Corporate and Other reportable segment.
