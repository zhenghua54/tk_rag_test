(2) Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018, and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented. In addition, our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.
