Management believes that net voyage revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides additional meaningful information because it enables us to compare the profitability of our vessels which are employed under bareboat charters, spot related time charters and spot charters.

We believe that our method of calculating net voyage revenue is consistent with industry standards. The table below reconciles our net voyage revenues to voyage revenues.
