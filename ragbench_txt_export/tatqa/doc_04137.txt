Performance stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. Autodesk has determined the grant-date fair value for these awards using the stock price on the date of grant or if the awards are subject to a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution over the vesting period. Autodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to performance stock units of $28.6 million, $33.7 million, and $22.9 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. As of January 31, 2019, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $5.6 million related to unvested performance stock units, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.81 years. At January 31, 2019, the number of performance stock units granted but unvested was 0.4 million.
