Prior to conversion, the convertible note hedges are not considered for purposes of the earnings per share calculations, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the convertible note hedges are expected to offset the dilutive effect of the 1.00% Notes and 1.625% Notes, respectively, when the stock price is above $18.50 per share, with respect to the 1.00% Notes, and $20.72 per share, with respect to the 1.625% Notes.
