The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate in 2019, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to the effect of state income taxes, difference between the U.S. and foreign tax rates, deferred tax state rate adjustment, share-based compensation, true up of deferred taxes, other non-deductible permanent items, and change in valuation allowance. In addition, the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are subject to varied applicable statutory income tax rates for the periods presented.
