With the exception of the 2026 and the 2047 Notes, using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at December 31, 2019, the carrying values of the Notes approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to the current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At December 31, 2019, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair value of the 2026 and the 2047 Notes were $893 million and $456 million, respectively.
