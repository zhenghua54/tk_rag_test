The Audit Committee has sole authority to approve contracts for non-audit services with the external auditor, subject to observing certain guidelines. In order to ensure that external auditor independence and objectivity is maintained, the Audit Committee considers whether the proposed arrangements will maintain external auditor independence. The external auditor must also satisfy the Company that it is acting independently.
