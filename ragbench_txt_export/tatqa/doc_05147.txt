We maintained a Loan and Security Agreement with SVB (the "Credit Facility") under which we had a term loan with an original borrowing amount of $6.0 million (the “Original Term Loan”). The Original Term Loan carried a floating annual interest rate equal to SVB’s prime rate then in effect plus 2%. The Original Term Loan matured and was repaid in May 2019.
