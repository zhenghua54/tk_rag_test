We recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At March 29, 2019, before any tax benefits, we had $43 million of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest included in our provision for income taxes was an expense of approximately $17 million for fiscal 2019. If the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such determination is made and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.
