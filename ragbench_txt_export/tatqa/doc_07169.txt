Total customers. We believe the total number of customers is a key indicator of our financial success and future revenue potential. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. A customer is typically a parent company or, in a few cases, a significant subsidiary that works with us directly. We expect to continue to grow our customer base through the addition of new customers in each of our markets.
