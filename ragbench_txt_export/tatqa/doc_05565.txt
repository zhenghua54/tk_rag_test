Each of the vessel-owning companies receives an annual subsidy, subject in each case to annual congressional appropriations, which is intended to offset the increased cost incurred by such vessels from operating under the U.S. Flag. Such subsidy was $5,000 for each vessel in 2019 and $5,000 on one vessel and $4,600 on one vessel in 2018.
