At March 31, 2019, certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in Brazil, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico and Korea had tax operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards totaling approximately $263,836. There is a greater likelihood of not realizing the future tax benefits of these net operating losses and other deductible
temporary differences in Brazil, Israel, China, and Korea since these losses and other deductible temporary differences must be used to offset future taxable income of
those subsidiaries, which cannot be assured, and are not available to offset taxable income of other subsidiaries located in those countries. Accordingly, we have
recorded valuation allowances related to the net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. Valuation allowances decreased $(12,101), and increased $317 and $6,812
during the years ended March 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, as a result of changes in the net operating losses of the subsidiaries or as a result of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates in the countries mentioned above
