On November 9, 2016, we completed the Spinoff of our Lamb Weston business. As of such date, we did not beneficially own any equity interest in Lamb Weston and no longer consolidated Lamb Weston into our financial results. The business results were previously reported in the Commercial segment. We reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
