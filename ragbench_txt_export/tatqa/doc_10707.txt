Autodesk recognizes revenue from the sale of (1) product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business agreements ("EBAs"), (2) renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license, and (3) consulting, training and other goods and services. The three categories are presented as line items on Autodesk's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
