Participating securities are composed of certain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan, and previously granted under the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, that may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares have a non-forfeitable right to dividends. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The common stock subject to repurchase is no longer classified as participating securities when shares revert to common stock outstanding as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses.
