At each reporting date, we weigh all available positive and negative evidence to assess whether it is more-likely-than-not that the Company's deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets associated with accumulated loss carryforwards and tax credits in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, will be realized. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, we recorded deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax loss carryforwards of $4,724 and $4,647, respectively, and U.S. and non- U.S. tax credits of $15,964 and $16,909, respectively. The deferred tax assets expire in various years primarily between 2021 and 2039.
