Our on-net revenues increased 5.9% from 2018 to 2019. We increased the number of our on-net customer connections by 8.4% at December 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. On-net customer connections increased at a greater rate than on-net revenues primarily due to the 3.8% decline in our on-net ARPU, primarily from a decline in ARPU for our net-centric customers. ARPU is determined by dividing revenue for the period by the average customer connections for that period. Our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers is determined by dividing the aggregate monthly recurring fixed charges for those customers by the aggregate committed data rate for the same customers. The decline in on-net ARPU is partly attributed to volume and term based pricing discounts. Additionally, on-net customers who cancel their service from our installed base of customers, in general, have an ARPU that is greater than the ARPU for our new customers due to declining prices primarily for our on-net services sold to our net-centric customers. These trends resulted in the reduction to our on-net ARPU and a 23.9% decline in our average price per megabit for our installed base of customers.
