The increase in Film and Electrolytic net sales was primarily driven by a $10.5 million increase in distributor sales across the Americas and EMEA regions. Also contributing to the increase in net sales was $1.7 million increase in EMS sales in the Americas region and a $0.8 million increase in OEM sales in the JPKO region. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in OEM sales across the APAC and EMEA regions and a $3.1 million decrease in distributor sales across the APAC and JPKO regions. In addition, there was an unfavorable impact of $0.1 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.
