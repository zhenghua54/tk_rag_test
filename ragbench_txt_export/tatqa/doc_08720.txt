There were 186,500, 219,450 and 252,100 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.
