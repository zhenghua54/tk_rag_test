Stock Repurchases. On August 22, 2011, we established a share repurchase program ("Share Repurchase Program"). On June 11, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an extension and increase of the Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of shares of our common stock over the subsequent 24 month period (for a total authorization of approximately $22,000,000 since inception of the program in August 2011). The common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions in our discretion. The timing and amount of the shares repurchased is determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program may be increased, suspended or discontinued at any time.
