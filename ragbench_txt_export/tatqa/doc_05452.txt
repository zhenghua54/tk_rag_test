When our CEO Alan Jope was appointed on 1 January 2019 he was appointed with Fixed Pay 14% below that of what the Committee proposed for his predecessor and at the lower quartile of our remuneration benchmarking peer group, despite Unilever being one of the largest companies in this peer group. This positioning was intentional, given Alan’s internal promotion on appointment. However, subject to Alan’s continuing good performance the Committee will, over time, continue to review his Fixed Pay positioning and progress this towards the market median benchmark.
