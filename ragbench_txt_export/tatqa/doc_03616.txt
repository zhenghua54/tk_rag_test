Gains on Equipment Transactions. We exchanged certain used network equipment and cash consideration for new network equipment resulting in gains of $1.0 million for 2018 and $3.9 million for 2017. The gains are based upon the excess of the estimated fair value of the new network equipment over the carrying amount of the returned used network equipment and the cash paid. The reduction in gains from 2017 to 2018 was due to purchasing more equipment under the exchange program in 2017 than we purchased in 2018.
