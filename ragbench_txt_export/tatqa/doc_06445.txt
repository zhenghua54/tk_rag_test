——Stock: A small contraction in stock had a negative effect on ARPR growth of £22 (2018: positive effect of £20) and was -15% (2018: +13%) of total ARPR growth. A reduction in the number of new cars registered, lower volumes of preregistration and some consumer uncertainty led to a lack of used car supply in the market during the first half of the year. Retailer stock has seen some level of recovery through the second half of the year although the market is still challenging.
