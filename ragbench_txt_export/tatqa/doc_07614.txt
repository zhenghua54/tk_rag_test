At December 31, 2019 our plan’s assets of $14.9 million were invested in five separate funds including a multiasset fund (32.4%), a diversified growth fund (32.6%), an index-linked gilt (13.0%), corporate bonds (14.0%), and insurance contracts (7%). The asset and growth funds aim to generate an ‘equity-like’ return over an economic cycle with significantly reduced volatility relative to equity markets and have scope to use a diverse range of asset classes, including equities, bonds, cash and alternatives, e.g. property, infrastructure, high yield bonds, floating rate debt, private, equity, hedge funds and currency. The bond fund and gilt fund are invested in index-linked gilts and corporate bonds. These investments are intended to provide a degree of protection against changes in the value of our plan’s liabilities related to changes in long-term expectations for interest rates and inflation expectations.
