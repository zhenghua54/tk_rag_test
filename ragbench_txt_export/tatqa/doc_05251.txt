On June 29, 2018, we entered into an asset-based loan facility (“ABL”) that increased our borrowing capacity from $75.0 million to $150.0 million. Additionally, we reduced the fixed-rate portion of interest charged on our senior secured term loan (“Term Loan”) from 475 basis points to 350 basis points over Adjusted LIBOR as a result of repricings executed on December 14, 2017 and November 16, 2018.
