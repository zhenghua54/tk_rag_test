It should be noted that the final cost will differ to the estimated cost when the actual method of equalisation is agreed between the scheme Trustees in due course. Any future and final adjustment to the cost recognised in 2018/19 will be reflected in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. All UK companies who operated defined benefit pension schemes during these dates will be affected by this ruling.
