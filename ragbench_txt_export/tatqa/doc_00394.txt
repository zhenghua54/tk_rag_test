Basic net earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for that period. The dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income per share assumes the exercise of options issued under our stock option plans (and the issuance of shares under our share plans) for periods in which exercises (or issuances) would have a dilutive effect.
