We also occupy facilities containing sales, distribution, technical, warehouse or administrative functions at a number of
locations in the U.S. and in many foreign countries/regions. Some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased. Stand-alone facilities of these types are generally leased. Our global headquarters is located in an owned property in Charlotte, North Carolina. For a list of those countries and regions outside of the U.S. where we have operations, see "Global Operations" above.
