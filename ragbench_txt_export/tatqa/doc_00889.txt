The Company’s existing license and collaboration agreements contain customer options for the license of additional products and territories. We determined the option’s standalone selling prices based on the option product’s potential market size in the option territory as compared to the currently licensed product and U.S. territory. Some of our existing license and collaboration agreements contain a license to the technology as well as licenses to tradenames or trademarks. The Company determined that the licenses to the tradenames or trademarks were immaterial in context of the contract.
