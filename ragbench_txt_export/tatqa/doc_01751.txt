Net Sales Net sales were $93,662 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $9,688 or 9.4% versus prior year. The net sales softness continued to reflect the overall lower consumption in the dairy and cultured dairy product categories. Versus prior year, the decline was primarily driven by lower volumes of our branded drinkable kefir and cupped kefir and Skyr sales, partially offset by the incremental volume of new item introductions.
