Contract costs consist of customer acquisition costs and costs to fulfill a contract, which includes commissions and their related payroll taxes, royalties, and referral fees. Contract costs are classified as either current or non-current based on the duration of time remaining between the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the anticipated amortization date of the associated costs.
