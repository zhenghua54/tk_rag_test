NET SALES
Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 were $1,361.2 million, a decrease of $141.7 million, or 9.4%, from
net sales of $1,502.9 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling prices for non-specialty
eggs in fiscal 2019 due to the oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, contrasted with fiscal
2018 in which we experienced strong demand resulting in higher prices for non-specialty eggs.
