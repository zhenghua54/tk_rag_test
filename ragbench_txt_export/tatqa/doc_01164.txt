As of May 26, 2019, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $1.4 million. This amount reflected net gains of $1.0 million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019, as well as net gains of $0.4 million incurred prior to fiscal 2019. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $0.9 million in fiscal 2020 and $0.5 million in fiscal 2021 and thereafter.
