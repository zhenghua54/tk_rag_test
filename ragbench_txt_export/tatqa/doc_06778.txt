The effective income tax rate was 18.9% and (141.8)% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2019 compared to statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily due to deferred tax adjustments related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state taxes, offset by changes in the valuation allowance and excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of non-qualified stock options.
