To calculate the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding, the number of incremental shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and assumed issuance of shares relating to RSUs is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation.
