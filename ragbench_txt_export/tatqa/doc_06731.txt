Life Sciences: Loss from equity investees within our Life Sciences segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $0.6 million to $3.4 million from $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in losses were largely due to lower equity method losses recorded from our investment in MediBeacon due to the timing of clinical trials and revenue from a licensing agreement which did not occur in the comparable periods.
