Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative $505.4 at December 31, 2019 compared to negative $200.4 at December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased income taxes payable, deferred revenue, and the adoption of ASC 842, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. The increase in income taxes payable is due primarily to the approximately $200.0 of taxes incurred on the gain associated with the divestiture of Gatan. We expect to pay these taxes in the second quarter of 2020. The deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services.
