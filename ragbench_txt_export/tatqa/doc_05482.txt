Each LTI Plan share is offered subject to the achievement of the performance measure, which is tested once at the end of the performance period. The LTI Plans will be measured against one performance measure â€“ relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). LTI Plan shares that do not vest after testing of the relevant performance measure, lapse without retesting.
