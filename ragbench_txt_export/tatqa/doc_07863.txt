Our investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth of our business and our increased international presence. We expect our investing cash flows to be affected by the timing of payments we make for capital expenditures and the strategic acquisition or other growth opportunities we decide to pursue.
