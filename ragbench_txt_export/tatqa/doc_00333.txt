WIRELESS The increase in capital expenditures in Wireless this year was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering reliable performance for our customers. We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.
