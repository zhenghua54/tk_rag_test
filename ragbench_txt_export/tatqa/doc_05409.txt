The change in our net contract assets/(liabilities) from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 was due primarily to the timing of payments and invoicing relating to SaaS and PCS renewals, partially offset by revenues recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $674.2, related to our contract liability balances at December 31, 2018. In addition, the impact of the 2019 business acquisitions increased net contract liabilities by $96.2.
