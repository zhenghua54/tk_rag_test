Our provisions for depreciation of plant and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements and software amounted to $22.6 million, $19.5 million and $17.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Generally, we use straight-line methods for depreciable real property over estimated useful lives ranging from 15 to 39 years or for leasehold improvements, the term of the underlying lease if shorter than the estimated useful lives. We typically use accelerated methods (declining balance) for machinery and equipment and software other than our ERP system over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.
