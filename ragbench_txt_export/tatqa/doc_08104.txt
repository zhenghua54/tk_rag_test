RSUs/PSUs are granted to executives and other eligible employees. The value of an RSU/PSU at the grant date is equal to the value of one BCE common share. Dividends in the form of additional RSUs/PSUs are credited to the participantâ€™s account on each dividend payment date and are equivalent in value to the dividend paid on BCE common shares. Executives and other eligible employees are granted a specific number of RSUs/PSUs for a given performance period based on their position and level of contribution. RSUs/PSUs vest fully after three years of continuous employment from the date of grant and, in certain cases, if performance objectives are met, as determined by the board of directors.
