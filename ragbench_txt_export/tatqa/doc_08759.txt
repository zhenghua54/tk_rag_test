The Group manages its capital structure by regularly reviewing its gearing ratio to ensure it maintains an appropriate level of gearing within facility covenants. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total interest bearing financial liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus net debt.
