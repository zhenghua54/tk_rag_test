As of February 28, 2019 and 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to NOLâ€™s in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain state tax credits that we believe are not likely to be realized. During fiscal 2019, we decreased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by approximately $5.9 million, as it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized based upon the assessment of positive and negative evidence. This reduction in our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to a release of valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances for state tax credits.
