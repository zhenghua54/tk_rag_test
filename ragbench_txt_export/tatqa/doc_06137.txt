Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $341.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $230.9 million decrease was the result of the recapture of reinsurance treaties by our Insurance segment in 2018 and was offset in part by improved performance of the Insurance segment subsequent to the KIC acquisition, significant reduction of losses at the Broadcasting segment driven by the cost cutting measures, and an increase in the working capital at our Telecommunications segments.
