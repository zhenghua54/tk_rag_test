Net cash provided by operating activities was $311.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, as a result of $58.1 million in loss before income tax expense adjusted by non-cash charges including the loss of marking to fair value of the embedded exchange feature of the Notes and related capped call transactions of $12.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $79.4 million, share-based payment expense of $162.9 million and debt discount and issuance cost amortization of $7.5 million. The net increase of $113.1 million from our operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to a $97.7 million increase in our deferred revenue as a result of increased sales of subscriptions and renewals of maintenance contracts, a $43.5 million increase in trade and other payables, provisions and other noncurrent liabilities, offset by a $19.6 million increase in trade receivables and a $8.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by income taxes paid, net of refunds, of $4.2 million.
