Year 2018 compared with year 2017
Maintenance revenue increased $4.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to (1) an increase in the first-year maintenance revenue; (2) our annual renewal rate of customers subscribing to maintenance, which was greater than 90%; and (3) increases in the maintenance renewal prices. Maintenance revenue for the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments increased $1.1 million, $2.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, compared to 2017.
