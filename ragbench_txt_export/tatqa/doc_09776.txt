The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was primarily driven by higher cash proceeds from sales of systems projects, including the Sunshine Valley, Sun Streams, and California Flats projects, and advance payments received for sales of solar modules prior to the step down in the U.S. investment tax credit as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by operating expenditures associated with initial ramp of certain Series 6 manufacturing lines and expenditures for the construction of certain projects.
