The Company is organized into three operating and reportable segments consisting of PSG, ASG and ISG. The Company's wafer manufacturing facilities fabricate ICs for all business units, as necessary, and their operating costs are reflected in the segments' cost of revenue on the basis of product costs. Because operating segments are generally defined by the products they design and sell, they do not make sales to each other.
