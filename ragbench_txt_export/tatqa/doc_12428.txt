An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the asset is recognised at the date of derecognition. Assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
