Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to an increase in labour-related costs of approximately $19.1 million and an increase in third party network usage fees of $1.3 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous costs of $0.6 million. The increase in labour-related costs was primarily due to increased headcount from recent acquisitions.
