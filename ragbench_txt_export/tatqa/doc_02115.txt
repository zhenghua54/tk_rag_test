Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return. We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return." Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%. ROIC and Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.
