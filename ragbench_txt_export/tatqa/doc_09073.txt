We also used $3.8 million for contingent consideration payments associated with our acquisitions of Greenview, Erado and DeliverySlip. In addition to these items, we paid $1.7 million to satisfy finance lease liabilities and $1.9 million to repurchase common stock related to the tax impact of vesting restricted awards in 2019.
