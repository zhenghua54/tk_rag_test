Net revenue: Net revenue from our Marine Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $21.8 million to $172.5 million from $194.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the volume of projects under execution across multiple reporting lines, including power cable repair in offshore renewables, telecom installation work, and a reduction in CWind Group revenue due to focusing on a mix of more profitable projects.
