Restructuring charges During the year we incurred charges of £386m (2017/18: £241m, 2016/17: £nil), primarily relating to leaver costs. These costs reflect projects within our group-wide cost transformation programme and include costs related to the remaining integration of EE and £23m costs to close the BT Pension Scheme and provide transition payments to affected employees.
