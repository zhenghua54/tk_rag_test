The Board keeps the capital requirements of the Group under regular review, maintaining a strong financial position to protect the business and provide flexibility of funding for growth. The Group earns a high return on capital, which is reflected in strong cash generation over time. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Our first priority is to maximise investment in the business to generate further good returns in the future, aligned with our strategy for growth and targeting improvement in our key performance indicators. Next, we prioritise finding suitable acquisitions that can expand our addressable market through increasing our geographic reach, deepening our market penetration or broadening our product range. Acquisition targets need to exhibit a good strategic fit and meet strict commercial, economic and return on investment criteria. When cash resources significantly exceed expected future requirements, we would look to return capital to shareholders, as evidenced by special dividends declared in respect of 2010, 2012 and 2014. However, in the near term, we will look to reduce our financial leverage prior to considering new returns of capital to shareholders.
