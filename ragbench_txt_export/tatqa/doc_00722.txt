Total revenue increased $6.5 million, or 7.3%, from $89.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our total revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in our SaaS, software and hardware, and maintenance categories partially offset by decreases in our home health care services and sequencing and molecular analysis revenue categories.
