In January 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the ADTRAN, Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which authorized 13.0 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 under the 2006 Plan range from 2020 to 2024.
