Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and require
payment on a short-term basis. Invoices are generally issued at the point control transfers and substantially all of our invoices are due
within 30 days or less, however certain customers have terms of up to 120 days. For substantially all of our contracts, control of the
ordered product(s) transfers at our location. Periodically, we require payment prior to the point in time we recognize revenue. Amounts
received from customers prior to revenue recognition on a contract are contract liabilities, are classified as customer prepayments liability on our consolidated balance sheets and are typically applied to an invoice within 30 days of the prepayment.
