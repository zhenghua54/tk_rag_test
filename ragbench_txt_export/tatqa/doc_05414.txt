The Company leases certain of its corporate, manufacturing and other facilities from multiple third- party real estate developers. The operating leases expire at various dates through 2034, and some of these leases have renewal options, with the longest ranging up to two, ten-year periods. Several of these leases also include market rate rent escalations, rent holidays, and leasehold improvement incentives, all of which are recognized to expense on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term (including renewals that are reasonably assured) or the useful life of the asset. The Company also leases various machinery and equipment and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than one year to approximately 15 years.
