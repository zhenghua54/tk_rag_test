In fiscal 2019, the financial leverage ratio relating to net indebtedness over adjusted EBITDA has declined as a result of the sale of Cogeco Peer 1 on April 30, 2019 for a net cash consideration of $720 million and to a lesser extent growing adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in net indebtedness from generated free cash flow. In fiscal 2020, prior to the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, the financial leverage ratio relating to net indebtedness over adjusted EBITDA should continue to decline as a result of growing adjusted EBITDA and a projected reduction in net indebtedness from generated free cash flow.
