Our effective income tax rates were 9.5%, (84.0)% and 9.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rates were below the statutory rate primarily due to the tax windfall benefits from employee stockbased payment transactions, foreign derived intangible income deductions and research and development tax credits claimed, partially offset by the impact of non-deductible meal and entertainment expenses and state taxes.
