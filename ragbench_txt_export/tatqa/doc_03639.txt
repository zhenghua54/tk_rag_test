Research and development expenses in 2019 decreased by $4.6 million, or 21%, as compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel, resulting in a decrease of $3.1 million in compensation expense and $0.6 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2018. We did not incur restructuring costs in 2019, as compared to 2018 when $0.1 million was incurred as part of the 2018 Restructuring Plan (refer to Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Finally, the decrease was further driven by lower professional fees of $0.6 million, as we reduced the number of research and development contractors as compared to 2018.
