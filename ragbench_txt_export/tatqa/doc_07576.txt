In August 2016, the FASB released ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows – Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” The amendment provides and clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows to eliminate diversity in practice. The Company adopted the standard update in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, using a retrospective transition method. The Company’s adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
