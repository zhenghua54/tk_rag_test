During the first quarter of 2019, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to simplify and refine its operating model in the U.S. (the “Americas 2019 Exit Plan”), in part to improve agent attrition and absenteeism. The Americas 2019 Exit Plan included closing customer engagement centers, consolidating leased space in various locations in the U.S. and management reorganization. The Company finalized the actions as of September 30, 2019.
