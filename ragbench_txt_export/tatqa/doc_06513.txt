Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 39% to RMB29,920 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 on a year-on-year basis. The increase was primarily due to greater revenue contributions from commercial payment, as well as revenue growth from cloud services as a result of deeper penetration in key verticals.
