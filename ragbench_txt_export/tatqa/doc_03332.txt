Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $37.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2019, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is due to additional investments in Brink POS sales and marketing and increased equity and incentive compensation, partially offset by savings in other departments. SG&A expenses associated with the internal investigation for 2019 were $0.6 million as compared to $1.1M in 2018.
