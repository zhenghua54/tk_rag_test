Our Bank Partners offer certain loan products that have a feature whereby the account holder is provided a promotional period to repay the loan principal balance in full without incurring a finance charge. For these loan products, we bill interest each month throughout the promotional period and, under the terms of the contracts with our Bank Partners, we are obligated to pay this billed interest to the Bank Partners if an account holder repays the loan balance in full within the promotional period. Therefore, the monthly process of billing interest on deferred loan products triggers a potential future finance charge reversal ("FCR") liability for the Company. The FCR component of our Bank Partner contracts qualifies as an embedded derivative. The FCR liability is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes and, as such, changes in its fair value are recorded within cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
