The $4.3 million net increase in the valuation allowance from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to operating losses incurred and windfall tax benefits on equity awards in the current year, partially offset by the reduction in valuation allowance as a result of recording a net deferred tax liability associated with the adoption of ASC 606. In addition, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $1.0 million for the release of a portion of the Companyâ€™s pre-existing U.S. and U.K. valuation allowances as a result of the Ataata and Simply Migrate business combinations.
