Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV (net asset value) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Such investments are generally considered long-term in nature with varying redemption availability. For certain of these investments, with a fair value of approximately $51.0 million as of May 26, 2019, the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds therein. As of May 26, 2019, funds with a fair value of $4.2 million have imposed such gates.
