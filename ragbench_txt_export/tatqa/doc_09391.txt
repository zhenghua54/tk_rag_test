Our quarterly results can vary from one period to the next, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next or any future quarter. Our revenue and operating results are therefore seasonal in nature due to the impact on income of the timing of new releases as well as timing and quantum of catalogue revenues.
