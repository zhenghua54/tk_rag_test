The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2019 of 10.4% was lower than the U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to the tax benefit from losses of our German subsidiaries, which are subject to higher tax rates than U.S. tax rates, adjustments related to the Tax Actâ€™s transition tax, the net excess tax benefits from restricted stock unit vesting, the benefit of federal research and development tax credits and our Singapore and South Korea tax exemptions. These amounts are partially offset by an accrual for foreign withholding taxes on certain current year foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested, stock-based compensation not deductible for tax purposes and limitations on the deductibility of compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).
