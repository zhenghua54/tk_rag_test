The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires assumptions, including the fair value of the Company's underlying common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield of the Company's common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managementâ€™s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
