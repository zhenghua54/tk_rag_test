Two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business in 2017, Horizon Clinicals and Series2000 Revenue Cycle, were sunset after March 31, 2018. The decision to discontinue maintaining and supporting these solutions was made prior to our acquisition of the EIS Business and, therefore, they are presented below as discontinued operations.
