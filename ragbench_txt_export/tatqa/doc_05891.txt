Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $137.6 million as compared to $183.9 million during the same period in 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted to add back depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $46.3 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to the timing of working capital. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily for funding capital expenditures, lease payments, stock repurchases, and acquisitions.
