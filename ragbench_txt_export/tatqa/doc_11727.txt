The majority of restricted stock units are subject to vesting. The underlying shares of common stock are issued when the restricted stock units vest. The majority of participants choose to participate in a broker-assisted automatic sales program to satisfy their applicable tax withholding requirements. We do not treat the shares sold pursuant to this automatic sales program as common stock repurchases.
