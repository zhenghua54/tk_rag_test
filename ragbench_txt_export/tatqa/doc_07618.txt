The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years ending prior to 2004. We are generally subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for all tax years since 2003 due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company was examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2016. This examination resulted in no adjustments. The Company changed its fiscal year end in 2007 from March 31 to September 30.
