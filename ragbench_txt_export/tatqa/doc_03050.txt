We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax statutes and regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and require significant judgment to apply. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2015. We are no longer subject to U.S. state tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2014. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next year our unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $1.9 million due to the acceptance of a portion of our amended research and development credits.
