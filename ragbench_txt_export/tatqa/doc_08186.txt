The decrease in working capital as at March 31, 2019 as compared to March 31, 2018 was primarily the result of an increase in short-term borrowings amounting to $208.9 million as at March 31, 2019 from $152 million as at March 31, 2018 due to overdraft against restricted deposits and loan installments due within 12 months.
