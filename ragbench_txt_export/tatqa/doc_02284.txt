In connection with the audit of the 2019 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with KPMG
which sets forth the terms by which KPMG will provide audit services to us. Any future disputes between KPMG
and us under that letter will be subject to certain specified alternative dispute resolution procedures, none of
which are intended to restrict the remedies that our shareholders might independently pursue against KPMG.
