This acquisition has also resulted in the re-balancing of the Group’s market portfolio which, post the acquisition of Enoro in FY18, was initially weighted towards the Utilities sector. With Sigma’s revenues concentrated in the Communications sector, the Group’s revenue portfolio is now re-balanced to ensure greater diversification across multiple industries, regions and clients.
