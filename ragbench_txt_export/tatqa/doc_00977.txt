Depreciation and amortization increased significantly in 2019 from the 2018 levels. The increased amortization resulting from the acquisition of CareSpeak and the resulting intangible assets were amortized for a full year in 2019 as opposed to only the fourth quarter of 2018. We also had three months of amortization related to the intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of RMDY in October 2019. We expect depreciation and amortization expense in 2020 to increase over 2019 levels due to the full year of amortization of RMDY intangibles.
