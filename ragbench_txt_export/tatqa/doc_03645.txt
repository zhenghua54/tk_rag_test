The increase in the contract assets balance during the period was primarily due to $203 million of revenue recognized that was not billed, in accordance with the terms of the contracts, as of December 31, 2019, offset by $193 million of contract assets included in the December 31, 2018 balance that were invoiced to Nielsenâ€™s clients and therefore transferred to trade receivables.
