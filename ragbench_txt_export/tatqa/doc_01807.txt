Net cash used in financing activities increased $278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to $250 million of stock repurchases under the ASR program, $167 million of open market stock repurchases and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability. This was partially offset by $150 million of lower debt payments and $14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction.
