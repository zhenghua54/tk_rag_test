Under certain circumstances issuance of common shares can result in an ownership change under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, which limits the Company’s ability to utilize carry-forwards from prior to the ownership change. Any such ownership change resulting from stock issuances and redemptions could limit the Company’s ability to utilize any net operating loss carry-forwards or credits generated before this change in ownership. These limitations can limit both the timing of usage of these laws, as well as the loss of the ability to use these net operating losses. It is likely that fundraising activities have resulted in such an ownership change.
