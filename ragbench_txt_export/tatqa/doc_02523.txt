The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019 was $44.1 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019, that, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $37.3 million. Recognition of these tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.
