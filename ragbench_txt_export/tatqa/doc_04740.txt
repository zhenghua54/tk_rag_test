Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or group, in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which
provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company’s resources on a regional basis. Net sales for the segments are attributed to the
region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and
order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment’s performance is evaluated based upon its operating
income (loss). A segment’s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and
other expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring costs and other charges, if any, such as the $1.7 million of restructuring costs in
fiscal 2019 and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus paid to full-time, non-executive employees during fiscal 2018 due to the Company's ability to access
overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (the "one-time employee bonus"). These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when
assessing the performance of the segments. Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm’s length transactions. The
accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.
