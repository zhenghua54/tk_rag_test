Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method. Common Share equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.
