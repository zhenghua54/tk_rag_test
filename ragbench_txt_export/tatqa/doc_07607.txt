Navios Holdings has historically financed its capital requirements with cash flows from operations, issuances of debt securities and borrowings under bank credit facilities. Main uses of funds have been refinancings of outstanding debt, capital expenditures for the acquisition of new vessels, new construction and upgrades at the port terminals and expenditures incurred in connection with ensuring that the owned vessels comply with international and regulatory standards. Navios Holdings may from time to time, subject to restrictions under its debt and equity instruments, including limitations on dividends and repurchases under its preferred stock, depending upon market conditions and financing needs, use available funds to refinance or repurchase its debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms Navios Holdings deems appropriate (which may be below par) and subject to Navios Holdings cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under Navios Holdingsâ€™ debt agreements, and other factors management deems relevant. Generally, our sources of funds may be from cash flows from operations, long-term borrowings and other debt or equity financings, proceeds from asset sales and proceeds from sale of our stake in our investments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure adequate financing or obtain additional funds on favorable terms, to meet our liquidity needs.
