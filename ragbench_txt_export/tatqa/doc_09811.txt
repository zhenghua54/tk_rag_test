Retrospective regulatory matters We have recognised a net charge of £27m (2017/18: £49m, 2016/17: £479m) in relation to regulatory matters in the year. This reflects the completion of the majority of compensation payments to other communications providers in relation to Ofcom’s March 2017 findings of its investigation into our historical practices on Deemed Consent by Openreach, and new matters arising. Of this, £31m is recognised in revenue offset by £4m in operating costs.
