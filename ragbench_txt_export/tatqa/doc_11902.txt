We are party to certain agreements with FNF, including agreements that were entered into when we were related parties. As a result of the Distribution, FNF no longer has an ownership interest in us, but was still considered a related party until December 1, 2019 due to the combination of certain shared board members, members of senior management and various agreements. As of December 1, 2019, the Chairman of our Board of Directors no longer serves as one of our executive officers, and FNF is no longer considered a related party.
