Other income increased by $143.0 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to a $54.2 million gain on the sale of our equity method investments in fiscal 2018, a $73.0 million impairment charge in fiscal 2017 in our 8point3 Energy Partners LP equity investment balance due to the adoption of ASC 606 which materially increased the investment balance and consequently, led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
