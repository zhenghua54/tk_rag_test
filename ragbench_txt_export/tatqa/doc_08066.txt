Operating Income: CGD operating income increased by 39% to $23.0 million in 2019 compared to $16.6 million in 2018. For fiscal 2019, operating profits improved primarily due to the results of cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions designed to optimize our cost position, and reduced R&D expenditures. Operating profits were higher from increased sales of ground combat training system sales but were lower on decreased sales from air combat training systems, simulation product development contracts, and international services contracts. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar had no significant impact on CGD operating income between 2018 and 2019.
