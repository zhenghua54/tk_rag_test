Cost of Professional service and other revenues decreased by $28.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of a decrease in labour-related costs of approximately $29.0 million resulting primarily from a reduction in the use of external labour resources, partially offset by an increase in other miscellaneous costs of $0.2 million.
