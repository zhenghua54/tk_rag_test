Diluted weighted-average shares is computed using basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period using the treasury-stock-type method and the if-converted method, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, and the outstanding senior convertible debentures.
