Interest and other expense, net, positively changed by $30.5 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by curtailment gains on our pension plans, mark-to-market gains on certain of our privately-held strategic investments, realized gains on sales of strategic investments, offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on December 17, 2018 in aggregate principal amount of $500 million and mark-to-market losses on marketable securities.
