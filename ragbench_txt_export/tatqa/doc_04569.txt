Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue from our Construction segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $28.1 million to $572.3 million from $600.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of project activity on certain large commercial construction projects that are now at or near completion in the current period. This was partially offset by costs associated with the construction modeling and detailing business as a result of an increase in project work and increases as a result of the acquisition of GrayWolf, which was acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2018.
