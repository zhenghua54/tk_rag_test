the acquisition and integration related charges in 2018 primarily related to the acquisition of Yahoo’s operating business (see “Special Items”) and a net gain from dispositions of assets and businesses in 2019 (see “Special Items”), partially offset by increases in advertising expenses, sales commission and bad debt expense. The increase in sales commission expense during 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily due to a lower net deferral of commission costs as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach.
