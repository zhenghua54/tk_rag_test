Adjusted a revenue decreased 5% for the year mainly due to the ongoing decline of fixed voice revenue. We continue to see a steeper than expected reduction in calls per fixed line as usage moves to mobile and IP. We continue to sell less low margin equipment and also experienced ongoing declines in some of our other legacy products such as private circuits. This was partially offset by growth in IP, Mobile and Networking. Weâ€™re also continuing to see encouraging growth in messaging volumes in Ventures.
