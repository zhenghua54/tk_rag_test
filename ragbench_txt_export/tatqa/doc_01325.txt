During the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts to hedge its exposure arising from borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate swap contracts, the Group agreed with the counterparties to exchange, at specified interval, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified for hedge accounting. Details of the Groupâ€™s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2019 have been disclosed in Note 38.
