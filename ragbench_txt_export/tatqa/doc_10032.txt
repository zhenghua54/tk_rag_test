In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.9 million, resulting from the additional borrowing of $9.0 million under the line of credit, net cash proceeds of $13.9 million from our common stock offering in May 2018 and proceeds of $676,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by scheduled payments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.
