In addition to providing pension benefits, we maintain two Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans which provide a portion of healthcare, dental, vision and life insurance benefits for certain retired legacy employees. These plans are in the U.S. and Canada. Covered employees who retired on or after attaining age 55 and who had rendered at least 10 years of service were entitled to post-retirement healthcare, dental and life insurance benefits. These benefits are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. The information below relates to these two plans.
