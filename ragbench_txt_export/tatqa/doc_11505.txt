The Company generates sales directly through its sales team and, to a growing extent, through its channel partners. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price once all revenue recognition criteria are met. Channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with the Company, and these partners do not carry any inventory of the Company’s products or solutions. Payment from channel partners is not contingent on the partner’s success in sales to end-customers. In the event that the Company offers rebates, joint marketing funds, or other incentive programs to a partner, recorded revenues are reduced by these amounts accordingly.
