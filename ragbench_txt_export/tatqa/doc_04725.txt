During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with the completion of the Pinnacle acquisition, we granted 2.3 million cash-settled stock appreciation rights with a fair value estimated at closing date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and a grant date price of $36.37 per share to Pinnacle employees in replacement of their unvested stock option awards that were outstanding as of the closing date. Approximately $14.8 million of the fair value of the replacement awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. As of May 26, 2019, the liability of the replacement stock appreciation rights was $0.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since acquisition.
