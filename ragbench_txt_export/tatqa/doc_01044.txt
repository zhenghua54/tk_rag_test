All audit and non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young were pre-approved by our audit committee. In certain circumstances, the audit committee delegates to one designated member to pre-approve such audit and non-audit services. Pre-approval by a designated member should be reported to the audit committee at its upcoming meeting.
