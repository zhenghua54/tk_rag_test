Under the TCJA, the global minimum tax on intangible income (GMT) provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Under U.S. GAAP, companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GMT as a component of tax expense in the period in which a company is subject to the rules, or (ii) account for GMT in a companyâ€™s measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected to recognize the GMT as a period cost and thus recorded $22 million of tax expense for federal and state impacts for fiscal 2019.
