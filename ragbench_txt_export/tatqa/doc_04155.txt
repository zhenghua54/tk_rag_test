Digital Online Channel Net Revenues The decrease in net revenues from digital online channels for 2019, as compared to 2018, was primarily due to: • lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise (reflecting our sale of the publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie in December 2018); and • lower revenues recognized from Hearthstone.
