Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2019, we had $121.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $49.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we may potentially be required to pay foreign and U.S. state income taxes to repatriate these funds. As of December 31, 2019, only the earnings in our Indian foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. The earnings of all other foreign entities are no longer indefinitely reinvested. We are also permanently reinvested for outside book/tax basis differences related to foreign subsidiaries. These outside basis differences could reverse through sales of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which are considered probable as of December 31, 2019.
