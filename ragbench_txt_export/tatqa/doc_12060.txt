Liquidity risk is managed to enable the Group to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due. Liquidity analysis is conducted to determine that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Group’s operational requirements and committed investments. The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective by maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities. Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 23. The Group’s policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
