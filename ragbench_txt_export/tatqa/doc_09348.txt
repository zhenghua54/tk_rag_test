Revenues were $962.0 million in 2018 compared to $904.5 million in 2017, an increase of $57.5 million, or 6%. Our servicing software solutions revenues increased 7%, or $52.5 million, primarily driven by loan growth on MSP® from new and existing  clients. Our origination software solutions revenues increased 3%, or $5.0 million, primarily driven by growth in our loan origination system solutions and a software license fee in our Lending Solutions business, partially offset by the effect of lower volumes on our Exchange and eLending platforms primarily as a result of the 26% decline in refinancing originations as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
