Typical costs to develop a traditional restaurant, excluding the land value, range from approximately$1.4 million to $2.0 million. The majority of our corporate restaurants are constructed on leased land or on land that we purchase and subsequently sell, along with the improvements, in sale and leaseback transactions. Upon completion of a sale and leaseback transaction, the Companyâ€™s initial cash investment is reduced to the cost of equipment, which ranges from approximately $0.4 million to $0.5 million.
