In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that aims to eliminate diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, our fiscal 2019. The retrospective transition method should be applied. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
