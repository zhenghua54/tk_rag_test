Subscription revenue increased by $76.3 million, or 19%, in 2018 when compared to 2017. The increase was attributable to new business, which included new customers, upsells, and renewals from existing customers. Professional services revenue decreased by $20.4 million, or 24%, in 2018 when compared to 2017. The decrease of professional services revenue is attributable to the execution of our strategic initiative to migrate much of our implementation services to our global partners.
