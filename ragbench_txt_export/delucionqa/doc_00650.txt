Secondary Method For Oil Change Reset Procedure Without pushing the brake pedal, place the ignition in the ON/RUN position (do not start the engine).  Fully press the accelerator pedal, slowly, three times within ten seconds.  Without pushing the brake pedal, place the ignition in the OFF position.  Note: If the indicator message illuminates when you start the vehicle, the oil change indicator system did not reset.  If necessary, repeat this procedure.
