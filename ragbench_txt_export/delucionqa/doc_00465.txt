Crossing Logs To cross a log, approach it at a slight angle (approximately 10 to 15 degrees).  This allows one front tire to be on top of the log while the other just starts to climb the log.  While climbing the log, modulate your brake and accelerator to avoid spinning the log out from under your tires.  Then ease the vehicle off the log using your brakes.  CAUTION: Do not attempt to cross a log with a greater diameter than the running ground clearance or the vehicle will become high-centered.
