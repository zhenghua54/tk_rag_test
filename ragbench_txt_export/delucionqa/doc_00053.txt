Dimmer Control The dimmer control is part of the headlight switch and is located on the left side of the instrument panel.  With the parking lights or headlights on, rotating the dimmer control upward will increase the brightness of the instrument panel lights.  Rotating the dimmer control will also adjust the interior and ambient light levels (e.g.  courtesy lights in the footwell, illuminated cupholders, and front door handles).  Mode Control Turn the mode control knob or press one of the Mode buttons on the touchscreen to adjust airflow distribution.  The airflow distribution mode can be adjusted so air comes from the instrument panel outlets, floor outlets, defrost outlets and demist outlets.
