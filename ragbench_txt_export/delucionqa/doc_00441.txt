Front Head Restraints To raise the head restraint, pull upward on the head restraint.  To lower the head restraint, push the adjustment button located on the base of the head restraint, and push downward on the head restraint.  The release button does not need to be pushed to adjust the head restraint.  To remove the head restraint, raise it as far as it can go, then push the adjustment button and the release button at the base of each post while pulling the head restraint up.  To reinstall the head restraint, put the head restraint posts into the holes and push downward.  Then adjust it to the appropriate height.  WARNING: A loose head restraint thrown forward in a collision or hard stop could cause serious injury or death to occupants of the vehicle.  Always securely stow removed head restraints in a location outside the occupant compartment.  ALL the head restraints MUST be reinstalled in the vehicle to properly protect the occupants.  Follow the preceding reinstallation instructions prior to operating the vehicle or occupying a seat.  Note: Do not reposition the head restraint 180 degrees to the incorrect position in an attempt to gain additional clearance to the back of the head.
