The integrated key fob contains a coin cell battery.  Do not ingest the battery; there is a chemical burn hazard.  If the coin cell battery is swallowed, it can cause severe internal burns in just two hours and can lead to death.  If you think a battery may have been swallowed or placed inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention.  Keep new and used batteries away from children.  If the battery compartment does not close securely, stop using the product and keep it away from children.  The battery in your vehicle is located in the right rear of the engine compartment.  Your vehicle may be equipped with a secondary battery used to power the Stop/Start system and the 12 Volt vehicle electrical system.  The secondary battery is located behind the wheel well for the front passenger wheel.  In addition to the four auxiliary switch wires, a fused battery wire and ignition wire are also located in the interior, on the passenger side under the instrument panel.  The Power Distribution Center is located in the engine compartment near the battery.  This center contains cartridge fuses, mini fuses, and relays.  The PDC top cover is labeled with each serviceable fuse/relay location, function, and size.
