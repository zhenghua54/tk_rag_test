Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.
