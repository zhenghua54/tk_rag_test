Mud Deep mud creates a great deal of suction around the tires and is very difficult to get through.  You should use DRIVE, with the transfer case in the 4L position to maintain your momentum.  If you start to slow to a stop, try turning your steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth for additional traction.  Mud holes pose an increased threat of vehicle damage and getting stuck.  They are normally full of debris from previous vehicles getting stuck.  As a good practice before entering any mud hole, get out and determine how deep it is, if there are any hidden obstacles and if the vehicle can be safely recovered if stuck.
