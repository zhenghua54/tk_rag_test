Engine Warm-Up Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.  Extreme Cold Weather (Below –22°F Or −30°C) To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from an authorized dealer) is recommended.  REMOTE START — IF EQUIPPED (DIESEL) This system uses the key fob to start the engine conveniently from outside the vehicle while still maintaining security.  The system has a range of approximately 328 ft (100 m).  Remote Start is used to defrost windows in cold weather, and to reach a comfortable climate in all ambient conditions before the driver enters the vehicle.  Note: The vehicle must be equipped with an automatic transmission to be equipped with Remote Start.  Obstructions between the vehicle and the key fob may reduce this range.  The Remote Start system will wait for the Wait To Start yellow telltale to extinguish before cranking the engine This allows time for the engine preheat cycle to heat the cylinder air, and is normal in cold weather.  WARNING: Do not start or run an engine in a closed garage or confined area.  Exhaust gas contains carbon monoxide (CO) which is odorless and colorless.  Carbon monoxide is poisonous and can cause serious injury or death when inhaled.  Keep key fobs away from children.  Operation of the Remote Start system, windows, door locks or other controls could cause serious injury or death.
