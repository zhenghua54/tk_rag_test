Windshield Washers To use the washer, pull the lever toward you and hold until desired spray is reached.  If the lever is pulled while in the delay range, the wiper will start and continue to operate for two or three wipe cycles after the lever is released.  Then, the intermittent interval previously selected will resume.  If the lever is pulled while in the off position, the wipers will operate for two or three wipe cycles.  Then, the wipers will turn off.  Note: As a protective measure, the washer will stop if the switch is held for more than 20 seconds.  Once the switch is released the washer will resume normal operation.  WARNING: Sudden loss of visibility through the windshield could lead to a collision.  You might not see other vehicles or other obstacles.  To avoid sudden icing of the windshield during freezing weather, warm the windshield with the defroster before and during windshield washer use.
