Recreational Towing — Four-Wheel Drive Models Note: The transfer case must be shifted into N (Neutral), automatic transmission must be in PARK, and manual transmission must be in gear (NOT in NEUTRAL) for recreational towing.  CAUTION: DO NOT dolly tow any 4WD vehicle.  Towing with only one set of wheels on the ground (front or rear) will cause severe transmission and/or transfer case damage.  Tow with all four wheels either ON the ground, or OFF the ground (using a vehicle trailer).  Tow only in the forward direction.  Towing this vehicle backwards can cause severe damage to the transfer case.  Automatic transmissions must be placed in PARK for recreational towing.  Manual transmissions must be placed in gear (not in Neutral) for recreational towing.  Before recreational towing, perform the procedure outlined under “Shifting Into N (Neutral)” to be certain that the transfer case is fully in N (Neutral).  Otherwise, internal damage will result.  Towing this vehicle in violation of the previously listed requirements can cause severe transmission and/or transfer case damage.  Damage from improper towing is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Do not use a bumper-mounted clamp-on tow bar on your vehicle.  The bumper face bar will be damaged.
