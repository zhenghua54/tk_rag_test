Key Left Vehicle Feature If a valid key fob is no longer detected inside the vehicle while the vehicle’s ignition system is in the ON/RUN or START position, the message “Key Fob Has Left The Vehicle” will be shown in the instrument cluster display along with an interior chime.  An exterior audible and visual alert will also be activated to warn the driver.  The vehicle’s horn will rapidly chirp three times along with a single flash of the vehicle’s exterior lights.  Note: The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle’s engine is left running with the key fob inside.
