Cooling System Pressure Cap The cap must be fully tightened to prevent loss of engine coolant (antifreeze), and to ensure that engine coolant will return to the radiator from the coolant expansion bottle/recovery tank if so equipped.  The cap should be inspected and cleaned if there is any accumulation of foreign material on the sealing surfaces.  WARNING: Do not open hot engine cooling system.  Never add engine coolant (antifreeze) when the engine is overheated.  Do not loosen or remove the cap to cool an overheated engine.  Heat causes pressure to build-up in the cooling system.  To prevent scalding or injury, do not remove the pressure cap while the system is hot or under pressure.  Do not use a pressure cap other than the one specified for your vehicle.  Personal injury or engine damage may result.
