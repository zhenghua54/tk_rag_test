Hill climbing requires good judgment and a good understanding of your abilities and your vehicle's limitations.  Hills can cause serious problems.  Some are just too steep to climb and should not be attempted.  You should always feel confident with the vehicle and your abilities.  You should always climb hills straight up and down.  Never attempt to climb a hill on an angle.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  If you stall or begin to lose headway while climbing a steep hill, allow your vehicle to come to a stop and immediately apply the brake.  Restart the engine and shift into REVERSE.  Back slowly down the hill allowing engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.
