For the proper maintenance intervals see "⇨maintenance plan" for gas engines or "⇨maintenance plan — diesel fuel up to b5 biodiesel" for diesel engines.  Diesel fuel is seldom completely free of water.  To prevent fuel system trouble, drain the accumulated water from the fuel/water separator using the fuel/water separator drain provided on the fuel filter housing.  If you buy good quality fuel and follow the listed cold weather recommendations, fuel conditioners should not be required in your vehicle.  If available in your area, a high cetane “premium” diesel fuel may offer improved cold-starting and warm-up performance.  A 12 Volt heater built into the fuel filter housing aids in preventing fuel gelling.  It is controlled by a built-in thermostat.  A Diesel Pre-Heat system both improves engine starting and reduces the amount of white smoke generated by a warming engine.
