Potential signs of vehicle overheating: Do not open hot engine cooling system.  Never add engine coolant (antifreeze) when the engine is overheated.  Do not loosen or remove the cap to cool an overheated engine.  Heat causes pressure to build-up in the cooling system.  To prevent scalding or injury, do not remove the pressure cap while the system is hot or under pressure.  Do not use a pressure cap other than the one specified for your vehicle.  Personal injury or engine damage may result.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately.
