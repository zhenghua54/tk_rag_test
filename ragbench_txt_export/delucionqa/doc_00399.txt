Tire Identification Number (TIN) The TIN may be found on one or both sides of the tire; however, the date code may only be on one side.  Tires with white sidewalls will have the full TIN, including the date code, located on the white sidewall side of the tire.  Look for the TIN on the outboard side of black sidewall tires as mounted on the vehicle.  If the TIN is not found on the outboard side, then you will find it on the inboard side of the tire.
