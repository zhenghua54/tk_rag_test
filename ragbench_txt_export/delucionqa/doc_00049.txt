Starting Fluids The engine is equipped with a glow plug preheating system.  If the instructions in this manual are followed, the engine should start in all conditions and no type of starting fluid should be used.  WARNING: Do not leave children or animals inside parked vehicles in hot weather.  Interior heat build-up may cause serious injury or death.  When leaving the vehicle, always make sure the keyless ignition node is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children, and do not leave the ignition of a vehicle equipped with Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.
