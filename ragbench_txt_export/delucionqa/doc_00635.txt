Turn Signal Indicator Lights When the left or right turn signal is activated, the turn signal indicator will flash independently and the corresponding exterior turn signal lamps will flash.  Turn signals can be activated when the multifunction lever is moved down (left) or up (right).  Note: A continuous chime will sound if the vehicle is driven more than 1 mile (1.6 km) with either turn signal on.  Check for an inoperative outside light bulb if either indicator flashes at a rapid rate.  Turn Signals Move the multifunction lever up or down to activate the turn signals.  The arrows on each side of the instrument cluster flash to show proper operation.  Note: If either light remains on and does not flash, or there is a very fast flash rate, check for a defective outside light bulb.  Outside Mirrors With Turn Signal â€” If Equipped Driver and passenger outside mirrors with turn signal lighting contain LEDs, which are located in the upper outer corner of each mirror.  The LEDs are turn signal indicators, which flash with the corresponding turn signal lights in the front and rear of the vehicle.  Turning on the Hazard Warning flashers will also activate these LEDs.
