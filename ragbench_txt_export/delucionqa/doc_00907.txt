ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light And ESC OFF Indicator Light The ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light in the instrument cluster will come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode.  It should go out with the engine running.  If the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light comes on continuously with the engine running, a malfunction has been detected in the ESC system.  If this light remains on after several ignition cycles, and the vehicle has been driven several miles (kilometers) at speeds greater than 30 mph (48 km/h), see an authorized dealer as soon as possible to have the problem diagnosed and corrected.  The ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light starts to flash as soon as the tires lose traction and the ESC system becomes active.  The ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light also flashes when the Traction Control System (TCS) is active.  If the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light begins to flash during acceleration, ease up on the accelerator and apply as little throttle as possible.  Be sure to adapt your speed and driving to the prevailing road conditions.  The ESC OFF Indicator Light indicates that the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) is in a reduced mode.  Note: The ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light and the ESC OFF Indicator Light come on momentarily each time the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode.  Each time the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position, the ESC system will be on even if it was turned off previously.  The ESC system will make buzzing or clicking sounds when it is active.  This is normal; the sounds will stop when ESC becomes inactive following the maneuver that caused the ESC activation.
