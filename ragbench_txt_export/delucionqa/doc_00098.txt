Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or "chock" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads.
