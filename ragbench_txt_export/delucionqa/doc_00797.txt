STOP/START SYSTEM â€” MANUAL TRANSMISSION (IF EQUIPPED) The Engine Stop/Start (ESS) function is developed to reduce fuel consumption.  The system will stop the engine automatically during a vehicle stop if the required conditions are met.  Pressing the clutch pedal will automatically restart the vehicle.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.
