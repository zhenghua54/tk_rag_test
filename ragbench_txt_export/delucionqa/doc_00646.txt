Snow Tires Some areas of the country require the use of snow tires during the Winter.  Snow tires can be identified by a “mountain/snowflake” symbol on the tire sidewall.  If you need snow tires, select tires that are equivalent in size and type to the original equipment tires.  Use snow tires only in sets of four; failure to do so may adversely affect the safety and handling of your vehicle.  Snow tires generally have lower speed ratings than what was originally equipped with your vehicle and should not be operated at sustained speeds over 75 mph (120 km/h).  For speeds above 75 mph (120 km/h), refer to original equipment or an authorized tire dealer for recommended safe operating speeds, loading and cold tire inflation pressures.  While studded tires improve performance on ice, skid and traction capability on wet or dry surfaces may be poorer than that of non-studded tires.  Some states prohibit studded tires; therefore, local laws should be checked before using these tire types.
