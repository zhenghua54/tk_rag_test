While the Cruise Control is set, press the accelerator to pass as you would normally.  When the pedal is released, the vehicle will return to the set speed.  Keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal can cause the vehicle to continue to accelerate beyond the set speed.  If this occurs, the message “DRIVER OVERRIDE” will display in the instrument cluster display.  If you continue to accelerate beyond the set speed while ACC is enabled, the system will not be controlling the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  The vehicle speed will only be determined by the position of the accelerator pedal.  When engaged, the Cruise Control system takes over accelerator operations at speeds greater than 20 mph (32 km/h).
