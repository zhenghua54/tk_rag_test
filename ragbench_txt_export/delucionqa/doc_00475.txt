When the parking brake is applied and the automatic transmission is placed in gear, the Brake Warning Light will flash.  If vehicle speed is detected, a chime will sound to alert the driver.  Fully release the parking brake before attempting to move the vehicle.  This light only shows that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.  The parking brake lever is located in the center console.  To apply the parking brake, pull the lever up as firmly as possible.  To release the parking brake, pull the lever up slightly, push the center button, then lower the lever completely.  This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the Brake Warning Light remains on with the parking brake released, a brake system malfunction is indicated.  Have the brake system serviced by an authorized dealer immediately.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.
