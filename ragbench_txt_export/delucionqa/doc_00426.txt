The vehicle may be equipped with a refueling funnel.  Vehicles with diesel engines will have a cap to remove to begin the refueling process.  If refueling is necessary, while using an approved gas can, insert the refueling funnel into the filler neck opening.  Take care to open both flappers with the funnel to avoid spills.  Retrieve funnel from under the right rear seat.  Fuel Funnel Location Refueling Funnel Remove the fuel filler cap and insert the funnel into same filler pipe opening as the fuel nozzle.  Inserting Funnel Ensure funnel is inserted fully to hold flapper doors open.  Pour fuel into funnel opening.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  Remove funnel from filler pipe, clean off prior to putting back in the spare tire storage area.  Tighten the fuel filler cap until clicking is heard.  This is an indication the cap is properly tightened.  After an accident, remember to cycle the ignition to the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position and remove the key from the ignition switch to avoid draining the battery.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  If there are no fuel leaks or damage to the vehicle electrical devices (e.g.  headlights) after an accident, reset the system by following the procedure described below.  If you have any doubt, contact an authorized dealer.  If you continue operating the vehicle when the Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated you could cause the fluid to boil over, come in contact with hot engine or exhaust components and cause a fire.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause a fire.
