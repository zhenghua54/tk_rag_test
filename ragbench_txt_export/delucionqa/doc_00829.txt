Use the intermittent wiper when weather conditions make a single wiping cycle, with a variable pause between cycles, desirable.  Rotate the end of the lever to the first detent position for one of four intermittent settings.  The delay cycle can be set anywhere between 1 to 18 seconds.  Intermittent Wipers Rotate the end of the lever upward to the first detent past the intermittent settings for low-speed wiper operation.  Rotate the end of the lever upward to the second detent past the intermittent settings for high-speed wiper operation.
