FUEL REQUIREMENTS â€” GASOLINE ENGINE While operating on gasoline with the required octane number, hearing a light knocking sound from the engine is not a cause for concern.  However, if the engine is heard making a heavy knocking sound, see an authorized dealer immediately.  Use of gasoline with an octane number lower than recommended can cause engine failure and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Poor quality gasoline can cause problems such as hard starting, stalling, and hesitations.  If you experience these symptoms, try another brand of gasoline before considering service for the vehicle.
