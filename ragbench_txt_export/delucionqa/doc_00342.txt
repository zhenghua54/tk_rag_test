Door Frame Removal Using the provided #T40 Torx head driver and ratchet, loosen the Torx head fasteners located on the underside of each door hinge (two per door), and remove the fasteners by pulling downward.  Step one note: the fasteners will not fall out once completely loose, as they are held in place by design.  Step one lift the frame upward, removing it from the vehicle.  Step two store the fasteners in a secure location.  Repeat the procedure on the front door frame.  Note: The rear door frames must be removed first, followed by the front door frames.  WARNING: Do not drive your vehicle on public roads with the door and/or door frame(s) removed as you will lose the protection that they can provide.  This procedure is furnished for use during off-road operation only.
