Editing Your Notifications Notifications are an important element of your SiriusXM Guardian™ account.  For example, any time you use your remote services (such as Remote Door Unlock), you can elect to receive a text message, push notification, and/or E-mail to notify you of the event.  To set up the notifications, please follow these instructions.  Log on to your owner’s account at https://www.mopar.com/en-us.html (us residents) and select “dashboard”, or www.mopar.ca (canadian residents), select “my vehicle” and then “dashboard”.  Click the Edit/Edit Profile button.  Once there, select “SiriusXM Guardian™” where you can edit Notification Preferences.  You can enter a mobile phone and/or email address to notify you, and you can customize the types of messages.
