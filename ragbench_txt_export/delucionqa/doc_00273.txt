Connected Services Remote Horn & Lights FAQs How long does it take to sound my horn and flash the lights?  Depending on various conditions, it can take three minutes or more for the request to get through to your vehicle.  Which is faster, my key fob or the Vehicle Branded App?  Your key fob will sound the horn and flash the lights quicker; however, its range is limited.  How do I turn off the horn and lights after I turn them on?  If you are close enough to the vehicle, you can use the key fob to turn off the horn and lights by pressing the red Panic button.  Otherwise, Remote Horn & Lights will continue for a maximum of three minutes.  Why can’t all mobile devices use the Vehicle Branded App?  The Vehicle Branded App has been designed to work on most devices with the Apple® and Android™ operating systems.  The capabilities of these devices allow us to remotely command your vehicle.  Other operating systems may be supported in the future.
