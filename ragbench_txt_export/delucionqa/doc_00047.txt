Transporting Passengers NEVER TRANSPORT PASSENGERS IN THE CARGO AREA.  WARNING: Do not leave children or animals inside parked vehicles in hot weather.  Interior heat buildup may cause serious injury or death.  It is extremely dangerous to ride in a cargo area, inside or outside of a vehicle.  In a collision, people riding in these areas are more likely to be seriously injured or killed.  Do not allow people to ride in any area of your vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat belts.  Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and using a seat belt properly.
