The ParkSense Park Assist system provides visual and audible indications of the distance between the rear and/or front fascia/bumper and a detected obstacle when backing up or moving forward (e.g.  during a parking maneuver).  For system limitations and usage precautions, see ParkSense will turn off the Front Park Assist audible alert (chime) after approximately three seconds when an obstacle has been detected, the vehicle is stationary, and the brake pedal is applied.  ParkSense can be active only when the gear selector is in REVERSE or DRIVE.  If ParkSense is enabled at one of these gear selector positions, the system will remain active until the vehicle speed is increased to approximately 7 mph (11 km/h) or above.  A warning will appear in the instrument cluster display indicating the vehicle is above ParkSense operating speed.  The system will become active again if the vehicle speed is decreased to less than approximately 6 mph (9 km/h).  The ParkSense Warning screen is located within the instrument cluster display It provides visual warnings to indicate the distance between the rear fascia/bumper and/or front fascia/bumper and the detected obstacle.  ParkSense is only a parking aid and it is unable to recognize every obstacle, including small obstacles.  Parking curbs might be temporarily detected or not detected at all.  Obstacles located above or below the sensors will not be detected when they are in close proximity.  The vehicle must be driven slowly when using ParkSense in order to be able to stop in time when an obstacle is detected.  It is recommended that the driver looks over his/her shoulder when using ParkSense.
