Bumper End Cap Removal — If Equipped The end caps on your vehicle’s front bumper can be removed by the following steps: Loosen the two bolts that retain the GAWR bracket (Bolts #1 and #2) to the end cap using a T45 Torx bit screwdriver.  Do not remove the bolts.  Bolt #1 bolt #2 remove the remaining eight bolts.  Gently remove the end cap from the vehicle and store it where it will not get damaged.  Repeat this procedure on the other side.  Note: Bumper end caps are removable on steel bumpers only.
