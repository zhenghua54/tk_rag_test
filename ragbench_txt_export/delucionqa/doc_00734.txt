Getting High-Centered If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  CAUTION: Winching or rocking the vehicle off hard objects increases the risk of underbody damage.
