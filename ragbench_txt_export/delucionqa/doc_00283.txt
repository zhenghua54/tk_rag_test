Erasing all channels should only be performed when programming HomeLink® for the first time.  Do not erase channels when programming additional buttons.  It is recommended that you erase all the channels of your HomeLink® before you use it for the first time.  All HomeLink® buttons are programmed using this procedure.  You do not need to erase all channels when programming additional buttons.  To reprogram a single HomeLink® button that has been previously trained, without erasing all the channels, proceed as follows.  Be sure to determine whether the new device you want to program the HomeLink® button to has a rolling code, or non-rolling code.
