Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) — If Equipped The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are in a dedicated position below the headlight assembly.  DRLs are active when the low beams are not on while the vehicle’s transmission is in any position (automatic transmission), or when the vehicle begins to move (manual transmission).  Note: For vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.  On some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate, or reduce intensity, on one side of the vehicle (when a turn signal is activated on that side), or on both sides of the vehicle (when the hazard warning lights are activated).
