Priming If The Engine Has Run Out Of Fuel — Diesel Engine Add a substantial amount of fuel to the tank, approximately 2 to 5 gal (8 L to 19 L).  Push ignition switch twice without your foot on brake to put vehicle in RUN position.  This will activate the in tank fuel pump for approximately 30 seconds.  Repeat this process twice.  Start the engine using the Normal Starting procedure WARNING: Do not open the high pressure fuel system with the engine running.  Engine operation causes high fuel pressure.  High pressure fuel spray can cause serious injury or death.  CAUTION: The starter motor will engage for approximately 30 seconds at a time.  Allow two minutes between cranking intervals.  Note: The engine may run rough until the air is forced from all the fuel lines.  WARNING: Do not use alcohol or gasoline as a fuel blending agent.  They can be unstable under certain conditions and be hazardous or explosive when mixed with diesel fuel.  CAUTION: Due to lack of lubricants in alcohol or gasoline, the use of these fuels can cause damage to the fuel system.  Note: Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, "Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" is recommended to assist with cold starting.
