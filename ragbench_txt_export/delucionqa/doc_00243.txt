The Tonneau Cover can be installed on the truck bed to keep cargo out of view, and protect from inclement weather.  Crossbars should always be used whenever cargo is placed on the roof rack.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  Remember that everything put into or on the trailer adds to the load on your vehicle.  Also, additional factory-installed options or dealer-installed options must be considered as part of the total load on your vehicle.  Refer to the Tire And Loading Information Placard for the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo for your vehicle.
