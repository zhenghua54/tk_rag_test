Transporting Pets Air Bags deploying in the front seat could harm your pet.  An unrestrained pet will be thrown about and possibly injured, or injure a passenger during panic braking or in a collision.  Pets should be restrained in the rear seat (if equipped) in pet harnesses or pet carriers that are secured by seat belts.
