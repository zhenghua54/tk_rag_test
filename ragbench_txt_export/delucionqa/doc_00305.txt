Manual Front Seatback Recline Adjustment To recline the seat, pull on the recline strap and lean forward or rearward, depending on the direction you would like the seatback to move.  Release the strap when the desired position is reached and the seatback will lock into place.  WARNING: Do not ride with the seatback reclined so that the shoulder belt is no longer resting against your chest.  In a collision you could slide under the seat belt, which could result in serious injury or death.
