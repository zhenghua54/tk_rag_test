Automatic Transmission â€” If Equipped Select the DRIVE range when towing.  The transmission controls include a drive strategy to avoid frequent shifting when towing.  However, if frequent shifting does occur while in DRIVE, you can use the AutoStick shift control to manually select a lower gear.  Note: Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.
