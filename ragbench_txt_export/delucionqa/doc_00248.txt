Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  Do not open hot engine cooling system.  Never add engine coolant (antifreeze) when the engine is overheated.  Do not loosen or remove the cap to cool an overheated engine.  Heat causes pressure to build-up in the cooling system.  To prevent scalding or injury, do not remove the pressure cap while the system is hot or under pressure.  Do not use a pressure cap other than the one specified for your vehicle.  Personal injury or engine damage may result.  To prevent damage to the starter, do not continuously crank the engine for more than 10 seconds at a time.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before trying again.
