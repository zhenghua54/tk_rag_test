Headlight Switch The headlight switch is located on the left side of the instrument panel.  This switch controls the operation of the headlights, parking lights, automatic headlights (if equipped), instrument panel lights, instrument panel light dimming, interior lights, and fog lights (if equipped).  Rotate the headlight switch clockwise to the first detent for parking lights and instrument panel light operation.  Rotate the headlight switch to the second detent for headlights, parking lights, and instrument panel light operation.  Note: Vehicles sold in Canada are equipped with a headlight switch with an AUTO and ON detent but without an OFF detent.  Headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position.  However, the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) will be activated along with the front and rear marker lights.  The DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged.  Note: For vehicles sold in Canada, rotate the headlight switch clockwise from the parking lights and instrument panel light position to the first detent to turn on headlights, parking lights, and instrument panel light.  Rotate the headlight switch to the second detent for the AUTO position.
