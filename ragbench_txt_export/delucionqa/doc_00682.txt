Programming HomeLink® To A Miscellaneous Device The procedure on how to program HomeLink® to a miscellaneous device follows the same procedure as programming to a garage door opener Be sure to determine if the device has a rolling code, or non-rolling code before beginning the programming process.  Note: Canadian radio frequency laws require transmitter signals to time-out (or quit) after several seconds of transmission, which may not be long enough for HomeLink® to pick up the signal during programming.  Similar to this Canadian law, some U.S. gate operators are designed to time-out in the same manner.  The procedure may need to be performed multiple times to successfully pair the device to your HomeLink® buttons.  Identifying Whether You Have A Rolling Code Or Non-Rolling Code Device Before programming a device to one of your HomeLink® buttons, you must determine whether the device has a rolling code or non-rolling code.  Before You Begin Programming HomeLink® For efficient programming and accurate transmission of the radio-frequency signal, it is recommended that a new battery be placed in the hand-held transmitter of the device that is being programmed to the HomeLink® system.  Make sure your hand-held transmitter is programmed to activate the device you are trying to program your HomeLink® button to.  Ensure that your vehicle is parked outside of the garage before you begin programming.  It is recommended that you erase all the channels of your HomeLink® before you use it for the first time.
