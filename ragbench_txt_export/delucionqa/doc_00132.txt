Shifting Out of N (Neutral) Use the following procedure to prepare your vehicle for normal usage.  Bring the vehicle to a complete stop, leaving it connected to the tow vehicle.  Firmly apply the parking brake.  Start the engine.  Press and hold the brake pedal.  Shift the transmission into NEUTRAL.  Turn the engine off.  Shift the transfer case lever to the desired position.  Note: when shifting the transfer case out of n (neutral), the engine should remain off to avoid gear clash.  Shift the automatic transmission into PARK, or place manual transmission in NEUTRAL.  Release the brake pedal.  Disconnect vehicle from the tow vehicle.  Start the engine.  Press and hold the brake pedal.  Release the parking brake.  Shift the transmission into gear, release the brake pedal (and clutch pedal on manual transmissions), and check that the vehicle operates normally.
