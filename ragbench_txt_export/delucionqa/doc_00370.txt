CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEMS â€” IF EQUIPPED Your vehicle may be equipped with the Cruise Control system, or the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system: Cruise Control will keep your vehicle at a constant preset speed.  Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) will adjust the vehicle speed up to the preset speed to maintain a distance with the vehicle ahead.  Note: In vehicles equipped with ACC, if ACC is not enabled, Fixed Speed Cruise Control will not detect vehicles directly ahead of you.  Always be aware of the feature selected.  Only one Cruise Control feature can operate at a time.  For example, if Fixed Speed Cruise Control is enabled, Adaptive Cruise Control will be unavailable, and vice versa.
