Passengers should not remain in the vehicle when the vehicle is being jacked in position.  Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous.  The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you.  You could be crushed.  Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.  If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift.  Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack.  The jack is designed to be used as a tool for changing tires only.  The jack should not be used to lift the vehicle for service purposes.  The vehicle should be jacked on a firm level surface only.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Do not attempt to raise the vehicle by jacking on locations other than those indicated.
