Loading The vehicle maximum load on the tire must not exceed the load carrying capacity of the tire on your vehicle.  You will not exceed the tire's load carrying capacity if you adhere to the loading conditions, tire size, and cold tire inflation pressures specified on the Tire And Loading Information PlacardTo determine the maximum loading conditions of your vehicle, locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs” on the Tire And Loading Information Placard.  The combined weight of occupants, cargo/luggage and trailer tongue weight (if applicable) should never exceed the weight referenced here.  Note: Under a maximum loaded vehicle condition, gross axle weight ratings (GAWRs) for the front and rear axles must not be exceeded.  For further information on GAWRs, vehicle loading, and trailer towing, see Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum capacity of the front and rear axles.  Distribute the load over the front and rear axles evenly.  Make sure that you do not exceed either front or rear GAWR WARNING: It is important that you do not exceed the maximum front or rear GAWR.  A dangerous driving condition can result if either rating is exceeded.  Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum permissible load on the front and rear axles.  The load must be distributed in the cargo area so that the GAWR of each axle is not exceeded.  Each axle GAWR is determined by the components in the system with the lowest load carrying capacity (axle, springs, tires or wheels).  Heavier axles or suspension components sometimes specified by purchasers for increased durability do not necessarily increase the vehicle's GVWR.
