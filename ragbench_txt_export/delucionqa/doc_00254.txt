If the engine stalls or you lose headway or cannot make it to the top of a steep hill or grade, never attempt to turn around.  To do so may result in tipping and rolling the vehicle, which may result in severe injury.  Always back carefully straight down a hill in REVERSE.  Never back down a hill in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.  Never drive diagonally across a hill, always drive straight up or down.  Hill climbing requires good judgment and a good understanding of your abilities and your vehicle's limitations.  Hills can cause serious problems.  Some are just too steep to climb and should not be attempted.  You should always feel confident with the vehicle and your abilities.  You should always climb hills straight up and down.  Never attempt to climb a hill on an angle.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  ACC performance may be limited when driving on hills.  ACC may not detect a vehicle in your lane depending on the speed, vehicle load, traffic conditions, and the steepness of the hill.
