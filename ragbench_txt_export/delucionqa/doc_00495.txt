Fuel Operating Range *Number 1 ULSD Fuel should only be used where extended arctic conditions 0°F (-18°C) exist.  Note: use ultra low sulfur diesel (ulsd) fuels only.  Note: Use of Climatized ULSD Fuel or Number 1 ULSD fuel results in a noticeable decrease in fuel economy.  Climatized ULSD fuel is a blend of Number 2 ULSD fuel and Number 1 ULSD fuel which reduces the temperature at which wax crystals form in fuel.  The fuel grade should be clearly marked on the pump at the fuel station.  The engine requires the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.  Use of incorrect fuel could result in engine and exhaust system damage If climatized or Number 1 ULSD fuel is not available, and you are operating below 20°F (-6°C), in sustained arctic conditions, Mopar® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment (or equivalent) is recommended to avoid gelling (see Fuel Operating Range Chart).
