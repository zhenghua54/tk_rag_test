For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe engine oil installed in the engine at the factory is a high-quality energy conserving type lubricant.  Oil changes should be consistent with anticipated climate conditions under which vehicle operations will occur.  For recommended viscosity and quality gradesNON-DETERGENT OR STRAIGHT MINERAL OILS MUST NEVER BE USED.  See Engine Fluids and Lubricants for the correct engine oil viscositySynthetic engine oils which do not have both the correct API trademark and the correct SAE viscosity grade numbers should not be used.  Lubricant should be approximately 1/8 inch (3 mm) below the bottom edge of the oil fill hole.  Use only the manufacturer’s recommended fluid Trac-Lok is especially helpful during slippery driving conditions.  With both rear wheels on a slippery surface, a slight application of the accelerator will supply maximum traction.  Tire pressure may increase from 2 to 6 psi (13 to 40 kPa) during operation.  DO NOT reduce this normal pressure build-up or your tire pressure will be too low.  1 — Coolant Temperature 2 — Oil Temperature 3 — Battery Voltage 4 — Transmission Temperature 5 — Oil Pressure Operation in ambient temperature below 32°F (0°C) may require special considerations.  The following charts suggest these options:
