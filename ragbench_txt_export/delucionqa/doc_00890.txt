Sand Soft sand is very difficult to travel through with full tire pressure.  When crossing soft, sandy spots in a trail, maintain your vehicle's momentum and do not stop.  The key to driving in soft sand is using the appropriate tire pressure, accelerating slowly, avoiding abrupt maneuvers and maintaining the vehicle's momentum.  If you are going to be driving on large soft sandy areas or dunes, reduce your tire pressure to a minimum of 15 psi (103 kPa) to allow for a greater tire surface area.  Reduced tire pressure will drastically improve your traction and handling while driving on the soft sand, but you must return the tires to normal air pressure before driving on pavement or other hard surfaces.  Be sure you have a way to reinflate the tires prior to reducing the pressure.  CAUTION: Reduced tire pressures may cause tire unseating and total loss of air pressure.  To reduce the risk of tire unseating, while at a reduced tire pressure, reduce your speed and avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers.
