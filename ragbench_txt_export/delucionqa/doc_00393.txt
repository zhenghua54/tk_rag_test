The Lumbar Support Control knob is located on the outboard side of the front driver seat.  Rotate the control forward to increase and rearward to decrease the desired amount of lumbar support.  In the driver and outboard front passenger seats, the top of the shoulder belt can be adjusted upward or downward to position the seat belt away from your neck.  Push or squeeze the anchorage button to release the anchorage, and move it up or down to the position that serves you best.  The seat can be adjusted forward or rearward by using a bar located by the front of the seat cushion, near the floor.  While sitting in the seat, lift up on the bar located under the seat cushion and move the seat forward or rearward.  Release the bar once you have reached the desired position.  Then, using body pressure, move forward and rearward on the seat to be sure that the seat adjusters have latched.
