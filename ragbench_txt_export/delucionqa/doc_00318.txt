Child-Protection Door Lock System â€” Rear Doors To provide a safer environment for small children riding in the rear seats, the rear doors are equipped with a Child-Protection Door Lock system.  To use the system, open each rear door, temporarily remove the sealing plug for access, and use a flat-blade screwdriver (or mechanical key) to rotate the dial to the lock or unlock position.  Note: When the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged, the door can be opened only by using the outside door handle, even though the inside door lock is in the unlocked position.  After disengaging the Child-Protection Door Lock system, always test the door from the inside to make certain it is in the unlocked position.  After engaging the Child-Protection Door Lock system, always test the door from the inside to make certain it is in the locked position.  For emergency exit with the system engaged, move the lock lever rearward (located on the door trim panel), lower the window and open the door with the outside door handle.  WARNING: Avoid trapping anyone in a vehicle in a collision.  Remember that the rear doors can only be opened from the outside when the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged (locked).  Note: Always use this device when carrying children.  After engaging the child lock on both rear doors, check for effective engagement by trying to open a door with the internal handle.  Once the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged, it is impossible to open the doors from inside the vehicle.  Before getting out of the vehicle, be sure to check that there is no one left inside.
