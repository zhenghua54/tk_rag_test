CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEMS â€” IF EQUIPPED Your vehicle may be equipped with the Cruise Control system, or the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system: Cruise Control will keep your vehicle at a constant preset speed.  Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) will adjust the vehicle speed up to the preset speed to maintain a distance with the vehicle ahead.  Note: In vehicles equipped with ACC, if ACC is not enabled, Fixed Speed Cruise Control will not detect vehicles directly ahead of you.  Always be aware of the feature selected.  Only one Cruise Control feature can operate at a time.  For example, if Fixed Speed Cruise Control is enabled, Adaptive Cruise Control will be unavailable, and vice versa.  Cruise Control When engaged, the Cruise Control system takes over accelerator operations at speeds greater than 20 mph (32 km/h).  The Cruise Control buttons are located on the right side of the steering wheel.  WARNING: Cruise Control can be dangerous where the system cannot maintain a constant speed.  Your vehicle could go too fast for the conditions, and you could lose control and have an accident.  Do not use Cruise Control in heavy traffic or on roads that are winding, icy, snow-covered or slippery.  Using Cruise Control On Hills The transmission may downshift on hills to maintain the vehicle set speed.  The Cruise Control system maintains speed up and down hills.  A slight speed change on moderate hills is normal.  On steep hills, a greater speed loss or gain may occur so it may be preferable to drive without Cruise Control.  WARNING: Cruise Control can be dangerous where the system cannot maintain a constant speed.  Your vehicle could go too fast for the conditions, and you could lose control and have an accident.  Do not use Cruise Control in heavy traffic or on roads that are winding, icy, snow-covered or slippery.
