The parking brake lever is located in the center console.  To apply the parking brake, pull the lever up as firmly as possible.  To release the parking brake, pull the lever up slightly, push the center button, then lower the lever completely.  When the parking brake is applied and the automatic transmission is placed in gear, the Brake Warning Light will flash.  If vehicle speed is detected, a chime will sound to alert the driver.  Fully release the parking brake before attempting to move the vehicle.  This light only shows that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.  Apply the parking brake, shift the automatic transmission into PARK (P) (manual transmission in NEUTRAL) and place the ignition in OFF mode.  Turn off the heater, radio, and all electrical accessories.  If using another vehicle to jump start the battery, park the vehicle within the jumper cable’s reach, apply the parking brake and make sure the ignition is OFF.  Always secure your vehicle by fully applying the parking brake before activating the Manual Park Release.  In addition, you should be seated in the driver’s seat with your foot firmly on the brake pedal when activating the Manual Park Release.  Activating the Manual Park Release will allow your vehicle to roll away if it is not secured by the parking brake, or by proper connection to a tow vehicle.  Activating the Manual Park Release on an unsecured vehicle could lead to serious injury or death for those in or around the vehicle.
