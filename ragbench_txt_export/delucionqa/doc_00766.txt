Fuel Filler Cap The fuel filler cap is located on the left side of the vehicle.  To access the fuel filler cap, push on the fuel filler door to unlatch it.  To close the fuel filler door, push on it a second time.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.  Open the fuel filler door.  Fuel filler door remove the fuel cap by rotating it counterclockwise.  Fuel filler cap fully insert the gasoline nozzle into the filler pipe.  Fill the vehicle with fuel.  When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Wait five seconds before removing the fuel nozzle to allow excess fuel to drain from nozzle.  Remove gasoline nozzle, reinstall fuel cap and close the fuel filler door.  WARNING: Never have any smoking materials lit in or near the vehicle when the fuel door is open or the tank is being filled.  Never add fuel when the engine is running.  This is in violation of most state and federal fire regulations and may cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to turn on.  A fire may result if fuel is pumped into a portable container that is inside of a vehicle.  You could be burned.  Always place fuel containers on the ground while filling.  CAUTION: Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  Note: When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Tighten the fuel filler cap about a quarter turn until you hear one click.  This is an indication that the cap is properly tightened.  If the fuel filler cap is not tightened properly, the MIL will come on.  Be sure the cap is tightened every time the vehicle is refueled.
