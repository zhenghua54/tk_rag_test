Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum permissible load on the front and rear axles.  The load must be distributed in the cargo area so that the GAWR of each axle is not exceeded.  Each axle GAWR is determined by the components in the system with the lowest load carrying capacity (axle, springs, tires or wheels).  Heavier axles or suspension components sometimes specified by purchasers for increased durability do not necessarily increase the vehicle's GVWR.
