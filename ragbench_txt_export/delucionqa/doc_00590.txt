Do Not Operate The Engine With Low Oil Pressure If the Low Oil Pressure Warning Light turns on while driving, stop the vehicle and shut down the engine as soon as possible.  After the vehicle is safely stopped, restart the engine and monitor the lamp.  If the lamp is still illuminated, shut the engine off, contact an authorized dealer, and do not operate the vehicle until the cause is corrected.  If the lamp is no longer illuminated, the engine can be operated, but should be taken to an authorized dealer as soon as possible for further inspection.  Note: Do not operate the vehicle until the cause is corrected.  This light does not show how much oil is in the engine.  The engine oil level must be checked under the hood.  CAUTION: If oil pressure falls to less than normal readings, shut the engine off immediately.  Failure to do so could result in immediate and severe engine damage.
