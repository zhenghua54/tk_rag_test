Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) The GTW is the weight of the trailer plus the weight of all cargo, consumables and equipment (permanent or temporary) loaded in or on the trailer in its "loaded and ready for operation" condition.  The recommended way to measure GTW is to put your fully loaded trailer on a vehicle scale.  The entire weight of the trailer must be supported by the scale.  WARNING: If the gross trailer weight is 2,000 lb (907 kg) or more, it is recommended to use a weight-distributing hitch to ensure stable handling of your vehicle.  If you use a standard weight-carrying hitch, you could lose control of your vehicle and cause a collision.
