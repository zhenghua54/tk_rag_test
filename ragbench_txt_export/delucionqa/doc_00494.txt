Remote Start Front Defrost Activation — If Equipped When Remote Start is active, and the outside ambient temperature is 40°F (4.5°C) or below, the system will automatically activate front defrost for 15 minutes or less.  The time is dependent on the ambient temperature.  Once the timer expires, the system will automatically adjust the settings depending on ambient conditions.  See “Remote Start Comfort Systems — If Equipped” in the next section for detailed operation.
