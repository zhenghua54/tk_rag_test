Use of biodiesel mixture in excess of 20% can negatively impact the fuel filter's ability to separate water from the fuel, resulting in high pressure fuel system corrosion or damage.  In addition, commercially available fuel additives are not necessary for the proper operation of your diesel engine.  For extreme cold conditions, "MoparÂ® Premium Diesel Fuel Treatment" is recommended to assist with cold starting.  Biodiesel fuel may gel or solidify at low ambient temperatures, which may pose problems for both storage and operation.  Precautions can be necessary at low ambient temperatures, such as storing the fuel in a heated building or a heated storage tank, or using cold temperature additives.  Besides using unleaded gasoline with the proper octane rating, gasolines that contain detergents, corrosion and stability additives are recommended.  Using gasolines that have these additives will help improve fuel economy, reduce emissions, and maintain vehicle performance.
