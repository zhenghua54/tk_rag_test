The steering wheel contains a heating element that helps warm your hands in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel has only one temperature setting.  Once the heated steering wheel has been turned on, it will stay on until the operator turns it off.  The heated steering wheel may not turn on when it is already warm.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on.  Press the heated steering wheel button a second time to turn the heating element off.
