Installing The Rear Window And Quarter Panel Cover Assemblies If the rear window and quarter panel cover assemblies were previously removed, proceed as follows to install: Guide the top of the quarter panel cover assembly up into the retainer.  Step one caution: failure to follow all quarter panel cover assembly and rear window install steps could result in damage to the soft top or vehicle.  Engage the plastic retainers on the front of the cover assembly (toward the front of the vehicle) starting at the top, and working downward.  Step two note: it is critical that the retainers are fully engaged before the vehicle resumes motion.  Secure the hook-and-loop fastener at the upper front corner of each quarter panel cover assembly by pressing firmly.  Step three from either side, guide the rear window into the retainer while keeping the window level.  Step four engage the retainer along the bottom of the rear window beginning on the left side of the vehicle and working toward the center.  Then, move to the right side of the vehicle and continue from the center, working to the right until the rear window is secured in the lower retainer.  Step five engage the vertical retainers up the right and left side of the rear window.  Step six tuck the rear window under the soft top fabric and press firmly.  Step seven engage the rear window retainers in the lower right and left corners.  Note: both quarter panel cover assemblies and the rear window must all be removed together, or installed together.
