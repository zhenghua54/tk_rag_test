Side Step Removal — If Equipped There are two nuts connecting to the body side and one bolt connecting to the underbody on each attachment bracket.  There are four attachment brackets on each side step.  Fastener locations (one side) remove two nuts and one bolt from the underside of the vehicle for each of the four brackets.  Repeat for other side of vehicle.  Underside nuts after all bolts and nuts have been removed, pull the side step assembly off of the vehicle.  To reinstall the side steps align the studs to the body side holes and fasten all nuts on all four brackets.  Then secure all four bolts to the underbody.  Repeat the reassembly procedure for the other side.  Note: Prior to off-road usage, the side steps should be removed to prevent damage.

Inspect the wheel mounting surface prior to mounting the tire and remove any corrosion or loose particles.  Tighten the lug nuts/bolts in a star pattern until each nut/bolt has been tightened twice.  Ensure that the socket is fully engaged on the lug nut/bolt (do not insert it halfway).  After 25 miles (40 km), check the lug nut/bolt torque to be sure that all the lug nuts/bolts are properly seated against the wheel.
