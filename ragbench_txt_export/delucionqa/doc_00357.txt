UCONNECT SETTINGS The Uconnect system uses a combination of buttons on the touchscreen and buttons on the faceplate located on the center of the instrument panel.  These buttons allow you to access and change the Customer Programmable Features.  Many features can vary by vehicle.  Buttons on the faceplate are located below and/or beside the Uconnect system in the center of the instrument panel.  In addition, there is a SCROLL/ENTER control knob located on the right side.  Turn the control knob to scroll through menus and change settings.  Push the center of the control knob one or more times to select or change a setting.  Your Uconnect system may also have SCREEN OFF and MUTE buttons on the faceplate.  Push the SCREEN OFF button on the faceplate to turn off the Uconnect screen.  Push the button again or tap the screen to turn the screen on.  Press the Back Arrow button to exit out of a Menu or certain option on the Uconnect system.
