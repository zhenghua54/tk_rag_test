Before You Cross Any Type Of Water As you approach any type of water, you need to determine if you can cross it safely and responsibly.  If necessary, get out and walk through the water or probe it with a stick.  You need to be sure of its depth, approach angle, current and bottom condition.  Be careful of murky or muddy waters; check for hidden obstacles.  Make sure you will not be intruding on any wildlife, and you can recover the vehicle if necessary.  The key to a safe crossing is the water depth, current and bottom conditions.  On soft bottoms, the vehicle will sink in, effectively increasing the water level on the vehicle.  Be sure to consider this when determining the depth and the ability to safely cross.
