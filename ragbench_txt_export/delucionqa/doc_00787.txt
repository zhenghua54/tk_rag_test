ENGINE START/STOP Button Functions — With Driver’s Foot Off The Brake Pedal (In PARK Or NEUTRAL Position) The ENGINE START/STOP button operates similar to an ignition switch.  It has three modes: OFF, ACC, and RUN.  To change the ignition modes without starting the vehicle and use the accessories, follow these steps: Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).  Ignition Park Interlock This vehicle is equipped with an Ignition Park Interlock system which requires the transmission to be in PARK before the ignition can be turned to the OFF position.  This helps the driver avoid inadvertently leaving the vehicle without placing the transmission in PARK.  This system also locks the transmission in PARK whenever the ignition is in the OFF position.  Note: The transmission is NOT locked in PARK when the ignition is in the ACC position (even though the engine will be off).  Ensure that the transmission is in park, and the ignition is off (not in acc position) before exiting the vehicle.  Power-Up After switching the ignition key from OFF to either the ON/RUN or ACC position, or after a language change, you must wait at least 15 seconds prior to using the system
