The rear seatback can be locked using the vehicle key to secure items in the rear wall storage bin.  The seat lock is located on the upper outboard side of each seatback.  Both seatbacks should be locked to limit access to items behind seat.  This vehicle has front air bags and lap/shoulder belts for both the driver and front passenger.  The front air bags are a supplement to the seat belt restraint systems.  The driver front air bag is mounted in the center of the steering wheel.  The passenger front air bag is mounted in the instrument panel, above the glove compartment.  The words “SRS AIRBAG” or “AIRBAG” are embossed on the air bag covers.  This vehicle has an Occupant Classification System (“OCS”) in the front passenger seat.  The OCS is designed to activate or deactivate the Passenger Advanced Front Air Bag depending on the occupant’s seated weight.  It is designed to deactivate the Passenger Advanced Front Air Bag for an unoccupied seat and for occupants whose seated weight classifies them in a category other than a properly seated adult.  This could be a child, teenager, or even an adult.  Cargo must be securely tied down before driving your vehicle.  Improperly secured loads can fly off the vehicle, particularly at high speeds, resulting in personal injury or property damage.  Follow the roof rack cautions when carrying cargo on your roof rack.  Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.
