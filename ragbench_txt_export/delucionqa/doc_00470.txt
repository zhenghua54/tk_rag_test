If the light turns on while driving, safely pull over and stop the vehicle.  If the Air Conditioning (A/C) system is on, turn it off.  Also, shift the transmission into NEUTRAL and idle the vehicle.  If the temperature reading does not return to normal, turn the engine off immediately and call for service In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately.  This warning light warns of an overheated engine condition.  If the engine coolant temperature is too high, this indicator will illuminate and a single chime will sound.  If the temperature reaches the upper limit, a continuous chime will sound for four minutes or until the engine is able to cool; whichever comes first.  If you continue operating the vehicle when the Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated you could cause the fluid to boil over, come in contact with hot engine or exhaust components and cause a fire.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause a fire.  Do not open hot engine cooling system.  Never add engine coolant (antifreeze) when the engine is overheated.  Do not loosen or remove the cap to cool an overheated engine.  Heat causes pressure to build-up in the cooling system.  To prevent scalding or injury, do not remove the pressure cap while the system is hot or under pressure.  Do not use a pressure cap other than the one specified for your vehicle.  Personal injury or engine damage may result.  If the vehicle is overheating, it will need to be serviced by an authorized dealer.
