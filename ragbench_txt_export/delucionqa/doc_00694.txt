When the vehicle is shifted out of REVERSE with Camera Delay turned on and the TrailCam view is active, the TrailCam image will be displayed for up to 10 seconds unless the vehicle speed exceeds 8 mph (13 km/h), the transmission is shifted into PARK, the ignition is placed in the OFF position, or the touchscreen X button to disable display of the TrailCam view is pressed.  If the vehicle speed remains below 8 mph (13 km/h) while in 2WD or 4WD High, the TrailCam image will be displayed continuously until deactivated via the touchscreen X button, the transmission is shifted into PARK, or the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  The touchscreen X button to disable the display of the camera image is made available ONLY when the vehicle is not in REVERSE.  The TrailCam view will stay active regardless of the vehicle speed and time while in 4WD Low.  Whenever the TrailCam image is activated through the Manual Activation Methods, and the vehicle speed is greater than or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), a display timer for the image is initiated.  The image will continue to be displayed until the display timer exceeds 10 seconds.
