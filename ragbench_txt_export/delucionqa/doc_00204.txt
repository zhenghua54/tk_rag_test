Trailer Sway Control (TSC) TSC uses sensors in the vehicle to recognize an excessively swaying trailer and will take the appropriate actions to attempt to stop the sway.  When TSC is functioning, the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light will flash, the engine power may be reduced, and you may feel the brakes being applied to individual wheels to attempt to stop the trailer from swaying.  TSC is disabled when the ESC system is in the “Partial Off” or “Full Off” modes.  Note: TSC cannot stop all trailers from swaying.  Always use caution when towing a trailer and follow the trailer tongue weight recommendations.  See "⇨trailer towing" for further information.  WARNING: If TSC activates while driving, slow the vehicle down, stop at the nearest safe location, and adjust the trailer load to eliminate trailer sway.
