Transmission Limp Home Mode Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  In the event of a momentary problem, the transmission can be reset to regain all forward gears by performing the following steps: Even if the transmission can be reset, we recommend that you visit an authorized dealer at your earliest possible convenience.  An authorized dealer has diagnostic equipment to assess the condition of your transmission.  If the transmission cannot be reset, authorized dealer service is required.  Stop the vehicle.  Shift the transmission into PARK, if possible.  If not, shift the transmission to NEUTRAL.  Push and hold the ENGINE START/STOP button until the engine turns off.  Wait approximately 30 seconds.  Restart the engine.  Shift into the desired gear range.  If the problem is no longer detected, the transmission will return to normal operation.  Note: In cases where the instrument cluster message indicates the transmission may not re-engage after engine shutdown, perform this procedure only in a desired location (preferably, at an authorized dealer).
