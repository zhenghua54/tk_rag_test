Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ — Passive Entry (If Equipped) The Passive Entry system is a feature that allows you to lock and unlock the vehicle’s door(s) and tailgate without having to push the key fob lock or unlock buttons.  Note: Passive Entry may be programmed on/off through Uconnect Settings The key fob may not be detected by the vehicle Passive Entry system if it is located next to a mobile phone, laptop, or other electronic device; these devices may interfere with the key fob’s wireless signal and prevent the Passive Entry system from locking/unlocking the vehicle.  Passive Entry Unlock initiates Headlight Illumination On Approach (low beams, license plate lamp, parking lights) for whichever duration is set within the Uconnect Settings between 0, 30, 60 or 90 seconds.  Passive Entry Unlock also initiates two flashes of the turn signal lights.  If wearing gloves, if it has been raining/snowing, or there is salt/dirt covering the Passive Entry door handle, the unlock sensitivity can be affected, resulting in a slower response time.  The doors may unlock when water is sprayed on the Passive Entry door handles if the key fob is located outside of the vehicle within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the handle.  If the vehicle is unlocked by Passive Entry and no door is opened within 60 seconds, the vehicle will relock and, if equipped, will arm the Vehicle Security system.
