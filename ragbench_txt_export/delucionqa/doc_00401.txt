REFUELING IN EMERGENCY â€“ IF EQUIPPED The vehicle may be equipped with a refueling funnel.  Vehicles with diesel engines will have a cap to remove to begin the refueling process.  If refueling is necessary, while using an approved gas can, insert the refueling funnel into the filler neck opening.  Take care to open both flappers with the funnel to avoid spills.  Note: In certain cold conditions, ice may prevent the fuel door from opening.  If this occurs, lightly push on the fuel door to break the ice buildup and re-release the fuel door using the inside release button.  Do not pry on the door.
