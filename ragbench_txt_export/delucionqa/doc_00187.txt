Gasoline/Oxygenate Blends Some fuel suppliers blend unleaded gasoline with oxygenates such as ethanol.  Problems that result from using gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15) or gasoline containing methanol are not the responsibility of the manufacturer and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  CAUTION: DO NOT use E-85, gasoline containing methanol, or gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of these blends may result in starting and drivability problems, damage critical fuel system components, cause emissions to exceed the applicable standard, and/or cause the Malfunction Indicator Light to illuminate.  Please observe pump labels as they should clearly communicate if a fuel contains greater than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Do Not Use E-85 In Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFV) are compatible with gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of gasoline with higher ethanol content may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  If a Non-FFV vehicle is inadvertently fueled with E-85 fuel, the engine will have some or all of these symptoms: Operate in a lean mode.  OBD II Malfunction Indicator Light on.  Poor engine performance.  Poor cold start and cold drivability.  Increased risk for fuel system component corrosion.
