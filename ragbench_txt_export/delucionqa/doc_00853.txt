Whenever the Rear View Camera image is activated through the Back Up Camera button in the Controls menu, and the vehicle speed is greater than, or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), a display timer for the image is initiated.  The image will continue to be displayed until the display timer exceeds 10 seconds.  When the Rear View Camera image is being displayed, and the vehicle speed is below 8 mph (13 km/h) while in any gear, Zoom View is available.  By pressing the “magnifying glass” icon in the upper left of the display screen, the image will zoom in to four times the standard view.  Pressing the icon a second time will return the view to the standard Back Up Camera display.  When the vehicle is shifted out of REVERSE with Camera delay turned on, the rear Camera image will be displayed for up to 10 seconds unless the vehicle speed exceeds 8 mph (13 km/h), the transmission is shifted into PARK, the ignition is placed in the OFF position, or the touchscreen X button to disable display of the Rear View Camera image is pressed.  If the vehicle speed remains below 8 mph (13 km/h), the Rear View Camera image will be displayed continuously until deactivated via the touchscreen X button, the transmission is shifted into PARK, or the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  The touchscreen X button to disable display of the camera image is made available ONLY when the vehicle is not in REVERSE.  Manual Activation Of The Rear View Camera
