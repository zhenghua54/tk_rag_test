Automatic Operation Push the AUTO button on the faceplate, or the AUTO button on the touchscreen on the Automatic Temperature Control (ATC) Panel.  Next, adjust the temperature that you would like the system to maintain by adjusting the driver and passenger temperature control buttons.  Once the desired temperature is displayed, the system will achieve and automatically maintain that comfort level.  When the system is set up for your comfort level, it is not necessary to change the settings.  You will experience the greatest efficiency by simply allowing the system to function automatically.  To provide you with maximum comfort in the Automatic mode during cold start-ups, the blower fan will remain on low until the engine warms up.  The blower will increase in speed and transition into Auto mode.  Note: It is not necessary to move the temperature settings for cold or hot vehicles.  The system automatically adjusts the temperature, mode, and blower speed to provide comfort as quickly as possible.  The temperature can be displayed in U.S. Or metric units by selecting the u.s./metric customer-programmable feature within uconnect settings "â‡¨uconnect settings" .
