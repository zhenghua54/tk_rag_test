Autostop Mode The Stop/Start feature is enabled after every normal engine start.  It will remain in STOP/START NOT READY until you drive forward with a vehicle speed greater than 5 mph (8 km/h).  At that time, the system will go into STOP/START READY and if all other conditions are met, can go into an STOP/START AUTOSTOP ACTIVE mode.  WARNING: Vehicles with the Stop/Start system will be equipped with two batteries.  Both the main and the supplemental batteries must be disconnected to completely de-energize the 12 Volt electrical system.  Serious injury or death could result if you do not disconnect both batteries.  To learn how to properly disconnect, see an authorized dealer.
