The Roof Luggage Rack is designed to allow for carrying an additional cargo load on vehicles equipped with a Hard Top.  The load carried on the roof, when equipped with a luggage rack, must not exceed 100 lb (45 kg), this includes the weight of the crossbars, and it should be uniformly distributed over the cargo area.  Crossbars should always be used whenever cargo is placed on the roof rack.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  Cargo must be securely tied down before driving your vehicle.  Improperly secured loads can fly off the vehicle, particularly at high speeds, resulting in personal injury or property damage.  Follow the roof rack cautions when carrying cargo on your roof rack.
