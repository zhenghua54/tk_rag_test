US/CANADA Exposure to Radio Frequency Radiation The radiated output power of the internal wireless radio is far below the FCC and IC radio frequency exposure limits.  Nevertheless, the wireless radio will be used in such a manner that the radio is 8 inches (20 cm) or further from the human body.  The internal wireless radio operates within guidelines found in radio frequency safety standards and recommendations, which reflect the consensus of the scientific community.  The radio manufacturer believes the internal wireless radio is safe for use by consumers.  The level of energy emitted is far less than the electromagnetic energy emitted by wireless devices such as mobile phones.  However, the use of wireless radios may be restricted in some situations or environments, such as aboard airplanes.  If you are unsure of restrictions, you are encouraged to ask for authorization before turning on the wireless radio "â‡¨general information" .
