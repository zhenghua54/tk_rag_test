Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips
