Gasoline/Oxygenate Blends Some fuel suppliers blend unleaded gasoline with oxygenates such as ethanol.  Problems that result from using gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15) or gasoline containing methanol are not the responsibility of the manufacturer and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  CAUTION: DO NOT use E-85, gasoline containing methanol, or gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of these blends may result in starting and drivability problems, damage critical fuel system components, cause emissions to exceed the applicable standard, and/or cause the Malfunction Indicator Light to illuminate.  Please observe pump labels as they should clearly communicate if a fuel contains greater than 15% ethanol (E-15).
