Closing The Hood To close the hood, remove the support rod from the radiator crossmember, and install into the clip on the hood.  Lower the hood slowly.  Secure both of the hood latches.  WARNING: Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.
