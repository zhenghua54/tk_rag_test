Tire Spinning When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do not spin your vehicle's wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h), or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without stopping.  WARNING: Fast spinning tires can be dangerous.  Forces generated by excessive wheel speeds may cause tire damage or failure.  A tire could explode and injure someone.  Do not spin your vehicle's wheels faster than 30 mph (48 km/h) for more than 30 seconds continuously when you are stuck, and do not let anyone near a spinning wheel, no matter what the speed.
