Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) The GCWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle and trailer when weighed in combination.  Trailer And Tongue Weight Never exceed the maximum tongue weight stamped on your bumper or trailer hitch.  Consider the following items when computing the weight on the rear axle of the vehicle: the tongue weight of the trailer the weight of any other type of cargo or equipment put in or on your vehicle the weight of the driver and all passengers note: remember that everything put into or on the trailer adds to the load on your vehicle.  Also, additional factory-installed options or dealer-installed options must be considered as part of the total load on your vehicle.  Refer to the Tire And Loading Information Placard for the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo for your vehicle.  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) The GVWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle including driver, passengers, vehicle, options and cargo.  The label also specifies maximum capacities of front and rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR).  Total load must be limited so GVWR on front and rear GAWR are not exceeded.
