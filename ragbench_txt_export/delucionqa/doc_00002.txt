Secure the tailgate in this position by looping the tailgate straps behind the circular retainer on both sides.  The tailgate is dampened to provide a slower, more controlled lowering.  To open the tailgate, pull the release handle located on the center of the tailgate and guide it to the lowered position.  The vehicleâ€™s tailgate can be set to three positions: open, mid, or closed.  The mid position can be used to provide a loading surface for transporting sheet goods.  To use the mid position, open the tailgate and lower it to near mid position.  If the tailgate is lowered, the jack extension with hook can be added to this assembly to enable lowering of the spare tire without having to raise the tailgate.  To close the tailgate, lift upward until both sides latch into place.
