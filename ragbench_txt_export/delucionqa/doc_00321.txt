Zoom View When the Rear View Camera image is being displayed, and the vehicle speed is below 8 mph (13 km/h) while in any gear, Zoom View is available.  By pressing the “magnifying glass” icon in the upper left of the display screen, the image will zoom in to four times the standard view.  Pressing the icon a second time will return the view to the standard Back Up Camera display.  When Zoom View is selected while the vehicle is in REVERSE, then shifted to DRIVE, the camera delay view will display the standard Back Up Camera view.  If the vehicle is then returned to REVERSE gear from DRIVE, the Zoom View selection will automatically resume.  Shifting to NEUTRAL from any gear will maintain the selected view (Zoom or Standard) as long as the vehicle is below 8 mph (13 km/h).  If the vehicle is in PARK, Zoom View is available until the gear selector is placed in DRIVE or REVERSE and speeds are at or above 8 mph (13 km/h).  Note: If the vehicle is in DRIVE, NEUTRAL, or REVERSE, and speed is greater than or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), Zoom View is unavailable and the icon will appear gray.  While in Zoom View, the guidelines will not be visible.
