TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer’s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.

Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.  Towing Tips Before towing, practice turning, stopping and backing the trailer in an area away from heavy traffic.  If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.
