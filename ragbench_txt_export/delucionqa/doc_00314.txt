PARKVIEW REAR BACK UP CAMERA The ParkView Rear Back Up Camera allows you to see an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of your vehicle whenever the gear selector is in REVERSE.  The image will be displayed in the touchscreen display along with a caution note to “Check Entire Surroundings” across the top of the screen.  After five seconds this note will disappear.  The ParkView camera is located on the tailgate, above the vehicle license plate.  Note: Removing the tailgate will disable the rearview camera function.
