Certification Label As required by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations, your vehicle has a certification label affixed to the driver's side door or pillar.  This label contains the month and year of manufacture, Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), front and rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR), and Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).  A Month-Day-Hour (MDH) number is included on this label and indicates the Month, Day and Hour of manufacture.  The bar code that appears on the bottom of the label is your VIN.
