Engine start-up in very low ambient temperature could result in evident white smoke.  This condition will disappear as the engine warms up.  Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.  Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  After full load operation, idle the engine for a few minutes before shutting it down.  This idle period will allow the lubricating oil and coolant to carry excess heat away from the turbocharger.
