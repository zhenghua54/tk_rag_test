When To Use 4L Range When off-road driving, shift into 4L for additional traction and control on slippery or difficult terrain, ascending or descending steep hills, and to increase low speed pulling power.  This range should be limited to extreme situations such as deep snow, mud, steep inclines, or sand where additional low speed pulling power is needed.  Vehicle speeds in excess of 25 mph (40 km/h) should be avoided when in 4L range.  CAUTION: Do not use 4L range when operating the vehicle on dry pavement.  Driveline hardware damage can result.
