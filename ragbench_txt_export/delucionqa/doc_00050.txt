If the engine stalls or you lose headway or cannot make it to the top of a steep hill or grade, never attempt to turn around.  To do so may result in tipping and rolling the vehicle, which may result in severe injury.  Always back carefully straight down a hill in REVERSE.  Never back down a hill in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.  Never drive diagonally across a hill, always drive straight up or down.  Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  Moving from a high gear down to a lower gear is recommended to preserve brakes when driving down steep hills.  In addition, downshifting at the right time provides better acceleration when you desire to resume speed.  Downshift progressively.  Do not skip gears to avoid overspeeding the engine and clutch.
