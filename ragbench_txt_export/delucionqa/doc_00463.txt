START The engine will start.  Note: In case the ignition switch does not change with the push of the START/STOP ignition button, the key fob may have a low or depleted battery.  In this situation, a backup method can be used to operate the ignition switch.  Put the nose side of the key fob (side with the mechanical flip key) against the START/STOP ignition button and push to operate the ignition switch.  CAUTION: Do not press the mechanical key against the START/STOP ignition button.  Do not use sharp metal objects (e.g.  screwdriver etc.)  to pry the button out of the ignition switch.  This button comes as an assembly, and is not removable.  This can damage the silicone shield.  WARNING: When exiting the vehicle, always remove the key fob from the vehicle and lock your vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children, and do not leave the Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ Ignition in the ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Do not leave children or animals inside parked vehicles in hot weather.  Interior heat buildup may cause serious injury or death.  CAUTION: An unlocked vehicle is an invitation for thieves.  Always remove key fob from the vehicle and lock all doors when leaving the vehicle unattended.  Note: When opening the driver's door with the ignition in the ON/RUN (engine not running) position, a chime will sound to remind you to place the ignition in the OFF position.  In addition to the chime, the message will display “Ignition Or Accessory On” in the cluster.
