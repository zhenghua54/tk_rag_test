Recommended Distribution Hitch Adjustment Position the truck to be ready to connect to the trailer (do not connect the trailer).  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H1.  Measuring height (h) attach the trailer to the vehicle without the weight distribution bars connected.  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H2.  Install and adjust the tension in the weight distributing bars per the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations so that the height of the front fender is approximately H1 (H2=H1).  The truck can now be driven.  Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.
