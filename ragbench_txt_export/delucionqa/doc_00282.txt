Erasing All The HomeLink速 Channels To erase the channels, follow this procedure: Place the ignition switch into the ON/RUN position.  Push and hold the two outside HomeLink速 buttons (I and III) for up to 20 seconds, or until the HomeLink速 indicator light flashes.  Note: Erasing all channels should only be performed when programming HomeLink速 for the first time.  Do not erase channels when programming additional buttons.
