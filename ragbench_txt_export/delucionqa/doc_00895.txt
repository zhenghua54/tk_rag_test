The engine oil filter should be replaced with a new filter at every engine oil change.  A new engine may consume some oil during its first few thousand miles (kilometers) of operation.  This should be considered a normal part of the break-in and not interpreted as a problem.  Your vehicle may be equipped with an engine oil change indicator system.  The “Oil Change Required” message will display in the instrument cluster display for five seconds after a single chime has sounded to indicate the next scheduled oil change interval.  The engine oil change indicator system is duty cycle based, which means the engine oil change interval may fluctuate, dependent upon your personal driving style.
