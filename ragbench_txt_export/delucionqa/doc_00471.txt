Interior Courtesy Lights The Interior Courtesy Lights will turn on when the front doors are opened, by rotating the instrument panel dimmer control (dial on the right) on the headlight switch fully upward while the doors are closed, or if equipped, when the unlock button is pushed on the key fob.  The Interior Courtesy Lights are located in the center of the vehicle’s sport bar, and consist of one large center light and four smaller reading lights.  Each reading light can be turned on by pushing the lens.  Pushing the lens a second time will turn the light off.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle’s battery.
