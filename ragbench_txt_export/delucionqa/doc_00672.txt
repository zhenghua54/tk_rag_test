Programming HomeLink® To A Garage Door Opener To program any of the HomeLink® buttons to activate your garage door opener motor, proceed as follows: Place the ignition switch into the ON/RUN position.  Place the garage door opener transmitter 1 to 3 inches (3 to 8 cm) away from the HomeLink® button you wish to program, while keeping the HomeLink® indicator light in view.  Push and hold the HomeLink® button you want to program while you push and hold the garage door opener transmitter button you are trying to replicate.  Continue to hold both buttons and observe the HomeLink® indicator light.  The HomeLink® indicator light will flash slowly and then rapidly.  Once this happens, release both buttons.  Note: All HomeLink® buttons are programmed using this procedure.  You do not need to erase all channels when programming additional buttons.  Note: Make sure the garage door opener motor is plugged in before moving on to the rolling code/non-rolling code final steps.
