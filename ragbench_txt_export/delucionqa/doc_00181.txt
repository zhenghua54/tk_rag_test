With Remote Start, the engine will only run for 15 minutes.  Remote Start can only be used twice.  If an engine fault is present or fuel level is low, the vehicle will start and then shut down in 10 seconds.  The parking lights will turn on and remain on during Remote Start mode.  For security, power window operation is disabled when the vehicle is in the Remote Start mode.  The ignition must be placed in the ON/RUN position before the Remote Start sequence can be repeated for a third cycle.  For information on use with the Remote Start system, see These features will stay on through the duration of Remote Start, or until the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.  The climate control settings will change if manually adjusted by the driver while the vehicle is in remote start mode.  This includes turning the climate controls off using the OFF button.
