WARNING LIGHTS AND MESSAGES The warning/indicator lights will illuminate in the instrument panel together with a dedicated message and/or acoustic signal when applicable.  These indications are indicative and precautionary and as such must not be considered as exhaustive and/or alternative to the information contained in the Ownerâ€™s Manual, which you are advised to read carefully in all cases.  Always refer to the information in this chapter in the event of a failure indication.  All active telltales will display first if applicable.  The system check menu may appear different based upon equipment options and current vehicle status.  Some telltales are optional and may not appear.
