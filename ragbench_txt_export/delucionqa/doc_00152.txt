You can check which smartphones are compatible at g.co/androidauto/requirements.  Android Auto™ is a feature of your Uconnect system, and your Android™ 6.0 or higher powered smartphone with a data plan, that allows you to project your smartphone and a number of its apps onto the touchscreen radio display.  Android Auto™ brings you useful information, and organizes it into simple cards that appear just when they are needed.  Android Auto™ can be used with speech technology, the steering wheel controls, the knobs and buttons on your radio faceplate, and the radio display’s touchscreen to control many of your apps.  To use Android Auto™, perform the following procedure: Download the Android Auto™ app from the Google Play store on your Android™-powered smartphone.  Connect your Android™-powered smartphone to one of the media USB ports in your vehicle.  If the Android Auto™ app was not downloaded, the first time you plug your device in the app begins to download.  Your vehicle should be in PARK the first time you use the app.  Be sure to use the factory-provided USB cable that came with your phone, as aftermarket cables may not work.  Android Auto™ And LTE Data Coverage To use Android Auto™, make sure you are in an area with cellular coverage.  Android Auto™ may use cellular data and your cellular coverage is shown in the upper right corner of the radio screen.  Data plan rates apply.  Once the device is connected and recognized, the Phone icon on the drag & drop menu bar changes to the Android Auto™ icon.  How long does it take to sound my horn and flash the lights?  Depending on various conditions, it can take three minutes or more for the request to get through to your vehicle.  Which is faster, my key fob or the Vehicle Branded App?  Your key fob will sound the horn and flash the lights quicker; however, its range is limited.  How do I turn off the horn and lights after I turn them on?  If you are close enough to the vehicle, you can use the key fob to turn off the horn and lights by pressing the red Panic button.  Otherwise, Remote Horn & Lights will continue for a maximum of three minutes.  Why can’t all mobile devices use the Vehicle Branded App?  The Vehicle Branded App has been designed to work on most devices with the Apple® and Android™ operating systems.  The capabilities of these devices allow us to remotely command your vehicle.  Other operating systems may be supported in the future.
