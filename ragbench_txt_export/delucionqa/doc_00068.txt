Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Starting with the ignition in the OFF position.  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”).  Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”).
