Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) Warning Light This warning light monitors the ABS.  The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the ABS light remains on or turns on while driving, then the Anti-Lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and service is required as soon as possible.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally, assuming the Brake Warning Light is not also on.  If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.
