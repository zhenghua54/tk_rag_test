Rear Seat Armrest â€” If Equipped The center part of the rear seat can also be used as a rear armrest with cupholders.  To unfold it, grab the pull strap under the head restraint and pull it forward.  Note: The cupholder liner can be removed for cleaning.  WARNING: Be certain that the seatback is securely locked into position.  If the seatback is not securely locked into position the seat will not provide the proper stability for child seats and/or passengers.  An improperly latched seat could cause serious injury.
