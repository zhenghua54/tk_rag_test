The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  Ensure the front panel latch is closed prior to inserting the panel into the panels bag.  There is a pouch located on the front of the bag to store the provided hard top edge protectors that are used when the hard top is not installed on the vehicle.  The Interior Courtesy Lights will turn on when the front doors are opened, by rotating the instrument panel dimmer control (dial on the right) on the headlight switch fully upward while the doors are closed, or if equipped, when the unlock button is pushed on the key fob.
