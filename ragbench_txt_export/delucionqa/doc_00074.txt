Windshield Wiper Operation Rotate the end of the lever upward to the first detent past the intermittent settings for low-speed wiper operation.  Rotate the end of the lever upward to the second detent past the intermittent settings for high-speed wiper operation.  CAUTION: In cold weather, always turn off the wiper switch and allow the wipers to return to the park position before turning off the engine.  If the wiper switch is left on and the wipers freeze to the windshield, damage to the wiper motor may occur when the vehicle is restarted.  Mist Push upward on the wiper lever to activate a single wipe to clear off-road mist or spray from a passing vehicle.  As long as the lever is held up, the wipers will continue to operate.  For information on wiper care and replacement, see Note: The mist feature does not activate the washer pump; therefore, no washer fluid will be sprayed on the windshield.  The washer function must be used in order to spray the windshield with washer fluid.  WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND WASHERS The windshield wiper/washer control lever is located on the right side of the steering column; it operates the multiple wiper options.  The front wipers are operated by rotating a switch, located at the end of the lever.
