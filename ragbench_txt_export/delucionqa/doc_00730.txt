Service ACC/FCW Warning If the system turns off, and the instrument cluster display reads “ACC/FCW Unavailable Service Required” or “Cruise/FCW Unavailable Service Required”, there may be an internal system fault or a temporary malfunction that limits ACC functionality.  Although the vehicle is still drivable under normal conditions, ACC will be temporarily unavailable.  If this occurs, try activating ACC again later, following an ignition cycle.  If the problem persists, see an authorized dealer.
