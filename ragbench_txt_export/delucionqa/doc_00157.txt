The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  Bed Rail Tie Down Locations Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle’s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.  The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.  Supplemental Seat-Mounted Side Air Bags (SABs) are located in the outboard side of the front seats.  The SABs are marked with a “SRS AIRBAG” or “AIRBAG” on a label or on the seat trim on the outboard side of the seats.  Four auxiliary switches are located in the lower switch bank of the instrument panel and can be used to power various electrical devices.  1 — Retainers 2 — Fuel Filter Protective Cover The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.
