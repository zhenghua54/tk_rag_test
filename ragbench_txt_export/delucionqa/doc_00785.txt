Brake/Transmission Shift Interlock (BTSI) System This vehicle is equipped with a BTSI system that holds the transmission gear selector in PARK unless the brakes are applied.  To shift the transmission out of PARK, the engine must be running and the brake pedal must be pressed.  The brake pedal must also be pressed to shift from NEUTRAL into DRIVE or REVERSE when the vehicle is stopped or moving at low speeds.
