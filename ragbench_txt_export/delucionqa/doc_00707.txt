Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Warning Light (MIL) The Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is a part of an Onboard Diagnostic System called OBD II that monitors engine and automatic transmission control systems.  This warning light will illuminate when the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine start.  If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Certain conditions, such as a loose or missing gas cap, poor quality fuel, etc., may illuminate the light after engine start.  The vehicle should be serviced if the light stays on through several typical driving styles.  In most situations, the vehicle will drive normally and will not require towing.  When the engine is running, the MIL may flash to alert serious conditions that could lead to immediate loss of power or severe catalytic converter damage.  The vehicle should be serviced by an authorized dealer as soon as possible if this occurs.  WARNING: A malfunctioning catalytic converter, as previously referenced, can reach higher temperatures than in normal operating conditions.  This can cause a fire if you drive slowly or park over flammable substances such as dry plants, wood, cardboard, etc.  This could result in death or serious injury to the driver, occupants or others.  CAUTION: Prolonged driving with the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) on could cause damage to the vehicle control system.  It also could affect fuel economy and driveability.  If the MIL is flashing, severe catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon occur.  Immediate service is required.
