STOP/START SYSTEM â€” AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (IF EQUIPPED) The Engine Stop/Start (ESS) function is developed to reduce fuel consumption.  The system will stop the engine automatically during a vehicle stop if the required conditions are met.  Releasing the brake pedal or pressing the accelerator pedal will automatically restart the engine.  ESS vehicles have been upgraded with a heavy-duty starter, enhanced battery, and other upgraded engine parts, to handle the additional engine starts.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.
