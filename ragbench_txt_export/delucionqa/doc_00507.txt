Loading The actual total weight and the weight of the front and rear of your vehicle at the ground can best be determined by weighing it when it is loaded and ready for operation.  The entire vehicle should first be weighed on a commercial scale to ensure that the GVWR has not been exceeded.  The weight on the front and rear of the vehicle should then be determined separately to be sure that the load is properly distributed over the front and rear axle.  Weighing the vehicle may show that the GAWR of either the front or rear axles has been exceeded but the total load is within the specified GVWR.  If so, weight must be shifted from front to rear or rear to front as appropriate until the specified weight limitations are met.  Store the heavier items down low and be sure that the weight is distributed equally.  Stow all loose items securely before driving.  Improper weight distributions can have an adverse effect on the way your vehicle steers and handles and the way the brakes operate.  WARNING: Do not load your vehicle any heavier than the GVWR or the maximum front and rear GAWR.  If you do, parts on your vehicle can break, or it can change the way your vehicle handles.  This could cause you to lose control.  Overloading can shorten the life of your vehicle.
