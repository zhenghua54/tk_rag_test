JUMP STARTING If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster pack.  Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section carefully.  WARNING: Do not attempt jump starting if the battery is frozen.  It could rupture or explode and cause personal injury.  CAUTION: Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any other booster source with a system voltage greater than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor, alternator or electrical system may occur.  Note: When using a portable battery booster pack, follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and precautions.
