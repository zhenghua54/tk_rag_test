Cruise Control When engaged, the Cruise Control system takes over accelerator operations at speeds greater than 20 mph (32 km/h).  The Cruise Control buttons are located on the right side of the steering wheel.  WARNING: Cruise Control can be dangerous where the system cannot maintain a constant speed.  Your vehicle could go too fast for the conditions, and you could lose control and have an accident.  Do not use Cruise Control in heavy traffic or on roads that are winding, icy, snow-covered or slippery.
