The procedure on how to program HomeLink® to a miscellaneous device follows the same procedure as programming to a garage door opener Be sure to determine if the device has a rolling code, or non-rolling code before beginning the programming process.  HomeLink® replaces up to three hand-held transmitters that operate devices such as garage door openers, motorized gates, lighting, or home security systems.  The HomeLink® unit is powered by your vehicle’s 12 Volt battery.  The HomeLink® buttons that are located in the overhead console or sunvisor designate the three different HomeLink® channels.  To operate HomeLink®, push and release any of the programmed HomeLink® buttons.  These buttons will activate the devices they are programmed to with each press of the corresponding HomeLink® button.  The HomeLink® indicator light is located above the center button.  Place the ignition in the ON/RUN position.  Place the hand-held transmitter 1 to 3 inches (3 to 8 cm) away from the HomeLink® button you wish to program while keeping the HomeLink® indicator light in view.  Continue to press and hold the HomeLink® button, while you press and release (cycle) your hand-held transmitter every two seconds until HomeLink® has successfully accepted the frequency signal.  The indicator light will flash slowly and then rapidly when fully trained.  Watch for the HomeLink® indicator to change flash rates.  When it changes, it is programmed.  It may take up to 30 seconds or longer in rare cases.  The garage door may open and close while you are programming.  Press and hold the programmed HomeLink® button and observe the indicator light.  If the indicator light stays on constantly, programming is complete and the garage door/device should activate when the HomeLink® button is pressed.  To program the two remaining HomeLink® buttons, repeat each step for each remaining button.  DO NOT erase the channels.
