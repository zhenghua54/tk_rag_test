Temperature Grades The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  WARNING: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded.  Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure.
