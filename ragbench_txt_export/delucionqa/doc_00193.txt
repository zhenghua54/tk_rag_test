Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.
