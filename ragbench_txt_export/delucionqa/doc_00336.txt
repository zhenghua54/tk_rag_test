Tires Examine tires for excessive tread wear and uneven wear patterns.  Check for stones, nails, glass, or other objects lodged in the tread or sidewall.  Inspect the tread for cuts and cracks.  Inspect sidewalls for cuts, cracks, and bulges.  Check the lug nut/bolt torque for tightness.  Check the tires (including spare) for proper cold inflation pressure.
