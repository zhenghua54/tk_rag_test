The rearview mirror can be adjusted up, down, left, and right.  The mirror should be adjusted to center on the view through the rear window.  If equipped with the Door Off Mirror Kit, exterior rearview mirrors can be installed on to the upper body door hinges after the front doors have been removed.  Outside rearview mirrors are mounted on the doors.  If you choose to remove the doors, see an authorized dealer for a replacement cowl-mounted outside mirror.  Federal law requires outside mirrors on vehicles for on-road use.
