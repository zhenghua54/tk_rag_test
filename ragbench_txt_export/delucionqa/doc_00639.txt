Hill Climbing Hill climbing requires good judgment and a good understanding of your abilities and your vehicle's limitations.  Hills can cause serious problems.  Some are just too steep to climb and should not be attempted.  You should always feel confident with the vehicle and your abilities.  You should always climb hills straight up and down.  Never attempt to climb a hill on an angle.
