Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a convenience system.  It is not a substitute for active driver involvement.  It is always the driverâ€™s responsibility to be attentive of road, traffic, and weather conditions, vehicle speed, distance to the vehicle ahead and, most importantly, brake operation to ensure safe operation of the vehicle under all road conditions.  Your complete attention is always required while driving to maintain safe control of your vehicle.  Failure to follow these warnings can result in a collision and death or serious personal injury.  The ACC system: Does not react to pedestrians, oncoming vehicles, and stationary objects (e.g., a stopped vehicle in a traffic jam or a disabled vehicle).  Cannot take street, traffic, and weather conditions into account, and may be limited upon adverse sight distance conditions.  Does not always fully recognize complex driving conditions, which can result in wrong or missing distance warnings.
