If required for certain off-road uses, the windshield can be folded down.  However, the protection afforded by the windshield is then lost.  If you fold down the windshield, drive slowly and cautiously.  It is recommended that the speed of the vehicle be limited to 10 mph (16 km/h), with low range operation preferred if you are driving off-road with the windshield folded down.  The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.  Do not drive your vehicle on-road with the windshield down.  Do not drive your vehicle unless the windshield is securely fastened, either up or down.  Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn at all times when the windshield is down.  Be sure that you carefully follow the instructions for raising the windshield.  Make sure that the folding windshield, windshield wipers, side bars, and all associated hardware and fasteners are correctly and tightly assembled before driving your vehicle.  Failure to follow these instructions may prevent your vehicle from providing you and your passengersâ€™ protection in some accidents.  If you remove the doors, store them outside the vehicle.  In the event of an accident, a loose door may cause personal injury.  Raise the windshield as soon as the task that required its removal is completed and before you return to on-road driving.  Both you and your passengers should wear seat belts at all times, on-road and off-road, regardless of whether the windshield is raised or folded down.
