Closing To close the tailgate, lift upward until both sides latch into place.  CAUTION: After closing, pull back on the tailgate firmly to ensure it is securely latched.  Failure to securely latch the tailgate could result in damage to the vehicle or cargo.  Note: If the Tonneau Cover is installed, make sure the Tonneau Cover is fully closed before closing the tailgate.  Due to the presence of the Center High-Mounted Stop Lamp, removal of the tailgate is not recommended.
