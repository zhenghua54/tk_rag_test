Avoid Using Contaminated Fuel Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential seeBulk Fuel Storage — Diesel Fuel If you store quantities of fuel, good maintenance of the stored fuel is also essential.  Fuel contaminated with water will promote the growth of “microbes.” These microbes form “slime” that will clog the fuel filtration system and lines.  Drain condensation from the supply tank and change the line filter on a regular basis.  If the vehicle will not start see Note: When a diesel engine is allowed to run out of fuel, air is pulled into the fuel system.  WARNING: Do not open the high pressure fuel system with the engine running.  Engine operation causes high fuel pressure.  High pressure fuel spray can cause serious injury or death.  Fuel Oxidation Stability — Must Use Fuel Within Six Months Of Manufacture Biodiesel fuel has poor oxidation stability which can result in long term storage problems.  Fuel produced to approved ASTM standards, if stored properly, provides for protection against fuel oxidation for up to six months.
