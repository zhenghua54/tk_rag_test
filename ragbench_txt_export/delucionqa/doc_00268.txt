Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage.  Chemicals that make roads passable in snow and ice and those that are sprayed on trees and road surfaces during other seasons are highly corrosive to the metal in your vehicle.  Outside parking, which exposes your vehicle to airborne contaminants, road surfaces on which the vehicle is operated, extreme hot or cold weather, and other extreme conditions will have an adverse effect on paint, metal trim, and underbody protection.  If you drive on salted or dusty roads or if you drive near the ocean, hose off the undercarriage at least once a month.  It is important that the drain holes in the lower edges of the doors, rocker panels, and trunk be kept clear and open.  If you detect any stone chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately.  If your vehicle is damaged due to a collision or similar cause that destroys the paint and protective coating, have your vehicle repaired as soon as possible.  If you carry special cargo such as chemicals, fertilizers, de-icer salt, etc., be sure that such materials are well packaged and sealed.  If a lot of driving is done on gravel roads, consider mud or stone shields behind each wheel.  Use MoparÂ® Touch Up Paint on scratches as soon as possible.  An authorized dealer has touch up paint to match the color of your vehicle.  With the parking lights or headlights on, rotating the dimmer control upward will increase the brightness of the instrument panel lights.  Rotating the dimmer control will also adjust the interior and ambient light levels (e.g.  courtesy lights in the footwell, illuminated cupholders, and front door handles).
