STARTING THE ENGINE â€” GASOLINE ENGINE (IF EQUIPPED) Before starting your vehicle, adjust your seat, adjust both inside and outside mirrors, and fasten your seat belts.  WARNING: When exiting the vehicle, always remove the key fob from the ignition and lock your vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Do not leave children or animals inside parked vehicles in hot weather.  Interior heat build-up may cause serious injury or death.
