SCHEDULED SERVICING — GASOLINE ENGINE Your vehicle is equipped with an automatic oil change indicator system.  The oil change indicator system will remind you that it is time to take your vehicle in for scheduled maintenance.  Based on engine operation conditions, the oil change indicator message will illuminate.  This means that service is required for your vehicle.  Operating conditions such as frequent short-trips, trailer tow, or extremely hot or cold ambient temperatures will influence when the “Change Oil” or “Oil Change Required” message is displayed.  Have your vehicle serviced as soon as possible, within the next 500 miles (805 km).  On vehicles equipped with an instrument cluster display, “Oil Change Required” will be displayed and a single chime will sound, indicating that an oil change is necessary.  On vehicles not equipped with an instrument cluster display, “Change Oil” will flash in the instrument cluster odometer and a single chime will sound, indicating that an oil change is necessary.  An authorized dealer will reset the oil change indicator message after completing the scheduled oil change.  To reset the system follow the steps described Note: Under no circumstances should oil change intervals exceed 10,000 miles (16,000 km), 12 months or 350 hours of engine run time, whichever comes first.  The 350 hours of engine run or idle time is generally only a concern for fleet customers.
