This mirror automatically adjusts for headlight glare from vehicles behind you.  Headlight glare from vehicles behind you can be reduced by moving the small control under the mirror to the night position (toward the rear of the vehicle).  The mirror should be adjusted while set in the day position (toward the windshield).  The automatic high beam headlamp control can be turned on or off by selecting “on” under “auto dim high beams” within your uconnect settings "⇨uconnect settings" , as well as turning the headlight switch to the auto position and placing the multifunction lever in the high beam position.  Broken, muddy, or obstructed headlights and taillights of vehicles in the field of view will cause headlights to remain on longer (closer to the vehicle).  Also, dirt, film, and other obstructions on the windshield or camera lens will cause the system to function improperly.
