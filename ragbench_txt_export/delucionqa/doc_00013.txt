DEF tank DEF pump DEF injector Electronically-heated DEF Lines NOx sensors Temperature sensors SCR catalyst DEF is subject to freezing at the lowest temperatures.  For example, DEF may freeze at temperatures at or below 12°F (-11°C).  The system has been designed to operate in this environment.  Any containers or parts that come into contact with DEF must be DEF compatible (plastic or stainless steel).  Copper, brass, aluminum, iron or non-stainless steel should be avoided as they are subject to corrosion by DEF.  If DEF is spilled, it should be wiped up completely.  The DEF gauge (located on the instrument cluster display) will display the level of DEF remaining in the tank
