Automatic High Beam Headlamp Control — If Equipped The Automatic High Beam Headlamp Control system provides increased forward lighting at night by automatically controlling the high beams through the use of a camera mounted on the vehicle’s header.  This camera detects vehicle specific light and automatically switches from high beams to low beams until the approaching vehicle is out of view.  Note: the automatic high beam headlamp control can be turned on or off by selecting “on” under “auto dim high beams” within your uconnect settings "⇨uconnect settings" , as well as turning the headlight switch to the auto position and placing the multifunction lever in the high beam position.  Broken, muddy, or obstructed headlights and taillights of vehicles in the field of view will cause headlights to remain on longer (closer to the vehicle).  Also, dirt, film, and other obstructions on the windshield or camera lens will cause the system to function improperly.
