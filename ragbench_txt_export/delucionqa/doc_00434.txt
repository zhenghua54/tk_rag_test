In the event that additional traction is required, the transfer case 4H and 4L positions can be used to lock the front and rear driveshafts together, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  The 4H and 4L positions are intended for loose, slippery road surfaces only and not intended for normal driving.  Driving in the 4H and 4L positions on hard-surfaced roads will cause increased tire wear and damage to the driveline components.  For further information on shifting into 4H or 4L 4H The instrument cluster alerts the driver that the vehicle is in four-wheel drive, and the front and rear driveshafts are locked together.  The light will illuminate when the transfer case is shifted into the 4H position.
