Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) Warning Light This warning light will illuminate to indicate a problem with the ETC system.  If a problem is detected while the vehicle is running, the light will either stay on or flash depending on the nature of the problem.  Cycle the ignition when the vehicle is safely and completely stopped and the transmission is placed in the PARK position.  The light should turn off.  If the light remains on with the vehicle running, your vehicle will usually be drivable; however, see an authorized dealer for service as soon as possible.  If the light continues to flash when the vehicle is running, immediate service is required and you may experience reduced performance, an elevated/rough idle, or engine stall and your vehicle may require towing.  The light will come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and remain on briefly as a bulb check.  If the light does not come on during starting, have the system checked by an authorized dealer.  Note: This light may turn on if the accelerator and brake pedals are pressed at the same time.
