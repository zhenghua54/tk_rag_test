In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Your vehicle is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to meet the very stringent diesel emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
