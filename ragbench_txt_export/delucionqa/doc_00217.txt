DOOR FRAME â€” IF EQUIPPED WITH A SOFT TOP WARNING: Do not drive your vehicle on public roads with the door frame(s) removed as you will lose the protection that they can provide.  This procedure is furnished for use during off-road operation only.  CAUTION: Failure to follow these cautions may cause interior water damage, stains or mildew: Opening a door or lowering a window while the top is wet may allow water to drip into the vehicle's interior.  Careless handling and storage of the removable door frame(s) may damage the seals, causing water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The door frame(s) must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior.
