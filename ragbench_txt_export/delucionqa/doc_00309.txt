To close the hood, remove the support rod from the radiator crossmember, and install into the clip on the hood.  Lower the hood slowly.  Secure both of the hood latches.  Raise the hood slightly, and place a hand palm-side down in the center of the hood opening.  Locate the safety latch in the middle, and push the latch to the right to open.  Release both of the outside hood latches.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  Vehicle must be at a stop and the gear selector must be in PARK.  You may have to push down slightly on the hood before pushing the safety latch.  While lifting the hood, use both hands.  Before lifting the hood, check that the wiper arms are not in motion and not in the lifted position.
