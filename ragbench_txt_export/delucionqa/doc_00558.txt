To fold the seat bottom upward, proceed as follows: The rear seat bottoms can be folded upward into the Stadium Position to create more storage space on the vehicleâ€™s floor, and to access the under seat storage bins (if equipped).  The 60/40 Split Folding Rear Seat can be folded flat to access the storage area behind the seat.  The seat bottom can also be lifted into the Stadium Position to create more storage space on the rear floor, and provide access to the underseat storage bins (if equipped) Position the latch plate as close as possible to the anchor point.  At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch plate, grab and twist the seat belt webbing 180 degrees to create a fold that begins immediately above the latch plate.  Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing.  The folded webbing must enter the slot at the top of the latch plate.  Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer twisted.  Lift upward on each section of the seat bottom.
