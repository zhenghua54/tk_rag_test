HAZARD WARNING FLASHERS The Hazard Warning Flashers button is located on the instrument panel below the climate controls.  Push the button to turn on the Hazard Warning Flashers.  When the button is activated, all directional turn signals will flash on and off to warn oncoming traffic of an emergency.  Push the button a second time to turn off the Hazard Warning Flashers.  This is an emergency warning system and it should not be used when the vehicle is in motion.  Use only when your vehicle is disabled or creating a safety hazard warning for other motorists.  When you must leave the vehicle to seek assistance, the Hazard Warning Flashers will continue to operate even though the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Note: With extended use the Hazard Warning Flashers may wear down your battery.
