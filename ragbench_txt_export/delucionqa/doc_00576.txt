When crossing a ravine, gully, ditch, washout or a large rut, the angled approach is the key to maintaining your vehicle's mobility.  Approach these obstacles at a 45-degree angle and let each tire go through the obstacle independently.  You need to use caution when crossing large obstacles with steep sides.  Do not attempt to cross any large obstacle with steep sides at an angle great enough to put the vehicle at risk of a rollover.  If you get caught in a rut, dig a small trench to the right or left at a 45-degree angle ahead of the front tires.  Use the removed dirt to fill the rut ahead of the turnout you just created.  You should now be able to drive out following the trench you just created at a 45-degree angle.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires.
