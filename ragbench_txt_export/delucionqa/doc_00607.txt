The Roof Luggage Rack is designed to allow for carrying an additional cargo load on vehicles equipped with a Hard Top.  The load carried on the roof, when equipped with a luggage rack, must not exceed 100 lb (45 kg), this includes the weight of the crossbars, and it should be uniformly distributed over the cargo area.  To avoid damage to the roof rack and vehicle, do not exceed the maximum roof rack load capacity.  Always distribute heavy loads as evenly as possible and secure the load appropriately.  Long loads, which extend over the windshield, should be secured to both the front and rear of the vehicle.  Place a blanket or other protection between the surface of the roof and the load.  Travel at reduced speeds and turn corners carefully when carrying large or heavy loads on the roof rack.  Wind forces, due to natural causes or nearby truck traffic, can add sudden upward lift.  It is recommended to not carry large flat loads, such as wood panels or surfboards, which may result in damage to the cargo or your vehicle.  Load should always be secured to crossbars first, with tie down loops used as additional securing points if needed.  Tie loops are intended as supplementary tie down points only.  Do not use ratcheting mechanisms with the tie loops.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  External racks do not increase the total load carrying capacity of the vehicle.  Be sure that the total occupant and luggage load inside the vehicle, plus the load on the luggage rack, does not exceed the maximum vehicle load capacity.  The hard top is not designed to carry any additional loads, such as after-market roof racks, spare tires, building materials, hunting or camping supplies, etc.  T Do not move your vehicle until the top has been either fully attached to the front header, sport bar, and body, or fully removed.
