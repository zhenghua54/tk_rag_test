Trailer Hitch Classification The following chart provides the industry standard for the maximum trailer weight a given trailer hitch class can tow and should be used to assist you in selecting the correct trailer hitch for your intended towing condition.  Trailer hitch classification definitions class max.  Trailer hitch industry standards class i - light duty 2,000 lb (907 kg) class ii - medium duty 3,500 lb (1,587 kg) class iii - heavy duty 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) class iv - extra heavy duty 10,000 lb (4,535 kg) refer to the “trailer towing weights (maximum trailer weight ratings)” chart for the maximum gross trailer weight (gtw) towable for your given drivetrain in this section.  All trailer hitches should be professionally installed on your vehicle.  Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.
