The diesel engine does not require a break-in period due to its construction.  Normal operation is allowed, providing the following recommendations are followed: for the proper maintenance intervals see "⇨maintenance plan" for gas engines or "⇨maintenance plan — diesel fuel up to b5 biodiesel" for diesel engines.  A long break-in period is not required for the engine and drivetrain (transmission and axle) in your vehicle.  The engine is allowed to crank as long as 25 seconds.  If the engine fails to start during this period, please wait at least two minutes for the starter to cool before repeating start procedure.  If the Water in Fuel Indicator Light remains on, DO NOT START engine before you drain the water from the fuel filters to avoid engine damage
