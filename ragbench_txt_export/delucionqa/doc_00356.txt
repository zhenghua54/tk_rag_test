Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage.  Chemicals that make roads passable in snow and ice and those that are sprayed on trees and road surfaces during other seasons are highly corrosive to the metal in your vehicle.  Outside parking, which exposes your vehicle to airborne contaminants, road surfaces on which the vehicle is operated, extreme hot or cold weather, and other extreme conditions will have an adverse effect on paint, metal trim, and underbody protection.  The best protection against carbon monoxide entry into the vehicle body is a properly maintained engine exhaust system.  In addition to the four auxiliary switch wires, a fused battery wire and ignition wire are also located in the interior, on the passenger side under the instrument panel.  After an accident, remember to cycle the ignition to the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position and remove the key from the ignition switch to avoid draining the battery.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  If there are no fuel leaks or damage to the vehicle electrical devices (e.g.  headlights) after an accident, reset the system by following the procedure described below.  If you have any doubt, contact an authorized dealer.
