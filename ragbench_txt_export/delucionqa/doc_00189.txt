Gasoline/Oxygenate Blends Some fuel suppliers blend unleaded gasoline with oxygenates such as ethanol.  Problems that result from using gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15) or gasoline containing methanol are not the responsibility of the manufacturer and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  CAUTION: DO NOT use E-85, gasoline containing methanol, or gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of these blends may result in starting and drivability problems, damage critical fuel system components, cause emissions to exceed the applicable standard, and/or cause the Malfunction Indicator Light to illuminate.  Please observe pump labels as they should clearly communicate if a fuel contains greater than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Do Not Use E-85 In Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFV) are compatible with gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of gasoline with higher ethanol content may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  If a Non-FFV vehicle is inadvertently fueled with E-85 fuel, the engine will have some or all of these symptoms: Operate in a lean mode.  OBD II Malfunction Indicator Light on.  Poor engine performance.  Poor cold start and cold drivability.  Increased risk for fuel system component corrosion.  Reformulated Gasoline Many areas of the country require the use of cleaner-burning gasoline referred to as “reformulated gasoline”.  Reformulated gasoline contains oxygenates and are specifically blended to reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality.  The use of reformulated gasoline is recommended.  Properly blended reformulated gasoline will provide improved performance and durability of engine and fuel system components.
