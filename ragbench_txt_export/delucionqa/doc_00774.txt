Engine Oil Filter Selection A full-flow type disposable oil filter should be used for replacement.  The quality of replacement filter varies considerably.  We recommend using a Mopar® engine oil filter, if a Mopar® engine oil filter is unavailable only use filters that meet or exceed SAE/USCAR-36 Filter performance requirements.  Engine Oil Filter Replacement Residual oil in the housing may spill from the housing when the new filter is installed if the residual oil is not either removed from the housing or enough time has not elapsed to allow the oil to drain back into the engine.  When servicing the oil filter on this engine, open the filter cap approximately six turns until the cap o-ring is visible and stop.  Wait five minutes with the cap in this position to allow dirty engine oil to drain back into the engine.  After five minutes, the cap and filter assembly can be removed and discarded.  Engine Oil Filter The engine oil filter should be replaced with a new filter at every engine oil change.
