Programming HomeLink® To A Miscellaneous Device The procedure on how to program HomeLink® to a miscellaneous device follows the same procedure as programming to a garage door openerBe sure to determine if the device has a rolling code, or non-rolling code before beginning the programming process.  Note: Canadian radio frequency laws require transmitter signals to time-out (or quit) after several seconds of transmission, which may not be long enough for HomeLink® to pick up the signal during programming.  Similar to this Canadian law, some U.S. gate operators are designed to time-out in the same manner.  The procedure may need to be performed multiple times to successfully pair the device to your HomeLink® buttons.  Before You Begin Programming HomeLink® For efficient programming and accurate transmission of the radio-frequency signal, it is recommended that a new battery be placed in the hand-held transmitter of the device that is being programmed to the HomeLink® system.  Make sure your hand-held transmitter is programmed to activate the device you are trying to program your HomeLink® button to.  Ensure that your vehicle is parked outside of the garage before you begin programming.  It is recommended that you erase all the channels of your HomeLink® before you use it for the first time.  Programming HomeLink® To A Garage Door Opener To program any of the HomeLink® buttons to activate your garage door opener motor, proceed as follows: Place the ignition switch into the ON/RUN position.  Place the garage door opener transmitter 1 to 3 inches (3 to 8 cm) away from the HomeLink® button you wish to program, while keeping the HomeLink® indicator light in view.  Push and hold the HomeLink® button you want to program while you push and hold the garage door opener transmitter button you are trying to replicate.  Continue to hold both buttons and observe the HomeLink® indicator light.  The HomeLink® indicator light will flash slowly and then rapidly.  Once this happens, release both buttons.  Note: All HomeLink® buttons are programmed using this procedure.  You do not need to erase all channels when programming additional buttons.  Note: Make sure the garage door opener motor is plugged in before moving on to the rolling code/non-rolling code final steps.
