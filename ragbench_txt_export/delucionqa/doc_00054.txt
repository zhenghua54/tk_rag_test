Dimmer Control The dimmer control is part of the headlight switch and is located on the left side of the instrument panel.  With the parking lights or headlights on, rotating the dimmer control upward will increase the brightness of the instrument panel lights.  Rotating the dimmer control will also adjust the interior and ambient light levels (e.g.  courtesy lights in the footwell, illuminated cupholders, and front door handles).
