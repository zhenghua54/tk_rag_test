Fuel System Cautions CAUTION: Follow these guidelines to maintain your vehicleâ€™s performance: The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law.  Using leaded gasoline can impair engine performance and damage the emissions control system.  An out-of-tune engine, certain fuel or ignition malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to overheat.  If you notice a pungent burning odor or some light smoke, your engine may be out-of-tune or malfunctioning and may require immediate service.  Contact an authorized dealer for service assistance.  The use of fuel additives, which are now being sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.  Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol.  Fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems resulting from the use of such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of The manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Note: Intentional tampering with the emissions control system can result in civil penalties being assessed against you.
