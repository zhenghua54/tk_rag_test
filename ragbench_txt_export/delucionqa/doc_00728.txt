INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DISPLAY Your vehicle will be equipped with an instrument cluster display, which offers useful information to the driver.  With the ignition in the OFF mode, opening/closing of a door will activate the display for viewing, and display the total miles (kilometers) in the odometer.  Your instrument cluster display is designed to display important information about your vehicleâ€™s systems and features.  The driver interactive display, located in the instrument panel, indicates how systems are operating and gives you warnings when a system, or systems, needs your attention.  The steering wheel mounted controls allow you to scroll through and enter the main menus and submenus.  You can access the specific information you want to make selections and adjustments.
