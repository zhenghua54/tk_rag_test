A/C Button Press and release this button on the touchscreen, or push the button on the faceplate to change the current setting.  The A/C indicator illuminates when A/C is ON.  The Air Conditioning (A/C) button allows the operator to manually activate or deactivate the air conditioning system.  When the air conditioning system is turned on, cool dehumidified air will flow through the outlets into the cabin.  Note: If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.
