CYBERSECURITY Depending on applicability, your vehicle may be able to send or receive information from a wired or wireless network.  This information allows systems and features in your vehicle to function properly.  Your vehicle may be equipped with certain security features to reduce the risk of unauthorized and unlawful access to vehicle systems and wireless communications.  Vehicle software technology continues to evolve over time and FCA US LLC, working with its suppliers, evaluates and takes appropriate steps as needed.  As always, if you experience unusual behavior, contact an authorized dealer immediately, "⇨if you need assistance" , or refer to your uconnect radio instruction manual for additional contact information.  The risk of unauthorized and unlawful access to your vehicle systems may still exist, even if the most recent version of vehicle software (such as Uconnect software) is installed.  WARNING: ONLY insert trusted media devices/components into your vehicle.  Media of unknown origin could possibly contain malicious software, and if installed in your vehicle, it may increase the possibility for vehicle systems to be breached.  As always, if you experience unusual vehicle behavior, contact an authorized dealer immediately.  Note: to help further improve user experience, features, stability, etc., and minimize the potential risk of a security breach, vehicle owners should routinely check www.driveuconnect.com (us residents) or www.driveuconnect.ca (canadian residents) to learn about available uconnect software updates.
