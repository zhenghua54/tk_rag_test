With the vehicle rolling at 1 to 3 mph (2 to 5 km/h), shift an automatic transmission into NEUTRAL (N), or press the clutch pedal on a manual transmission.  While the vehicle is coasting at 1 to 3 mph (2 to 5 km/h), shift the transfer case lever firmly to the desired position.  Do not pause with the transfer case in N (Neutral).  Once the shift is completed, place the automatic transmission into DRIVE or release the clutch pedal on a manual transmission.  To utilize your manual transmission efficiently for both fuel economy and performance, it should be upshifted as listed in the recommended shift speed chart.  Shift at the vehicle speeds listed for acceleration.  When heavily loaded or pulling a trailer, these recommended up shift speeds may not apply.  Manual Transmission Shift Speeds in MPH (KM/H) Engine Speeds 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 3.6L Accel.  15 (24) 24 (39) 50 (80) 65 (104) 70 (112) Cruise 10 (16) 19 (31) 40 (64) 55 (88) 65 (105) The transmission will automatically downshift as the vehicle slows (to prevent engine lugging) and will display the current gear.  The transmission will automatically downshift to FIRST gear when coming to a stop.  After a stop, the driver should manually upshift (+) the transmission as the vehicle is accelerated.  You can start out, from a stop, in FIRST or SECOND gear (or THIRD gear, in 4L range).  Tapping (+) (at a stop) will allow starting in SECOND gear.  Starting out in SECOND or THIRD gear can be helpful in snowy or icy conditions.  If a requested downshift would cause the engine to overspeed, that shift will not occur.  The system will ignore attempts to upshift at too low of a vehicle speed.  Holding the gear selector in the (-) position will downshift the transmission to the lowest gear possible at the current speed.  Transmission shifting will be more noticeable when AutoStick is enabled.  The system may revert to automatic shift mode if a fault or overheat condition is detected.
