Crossing Ditches, Streams, Shallow Rivers Or Other Flowing Water Flowing water can be extremely dangerous.  Never attempt to cross a fast running stream or river even in shallow water.  Fast moving water can easily push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  Even in very shallow water, a high current can still wash the dirt out from around your tires putting you and your vehicle in jeopardy.  There is still a high risk of personal injury and vehicle damage with slower water currents in depths greater than the vehicle's running ground clearance.  You should never attempt to cross flowing water which is deeper than the vehicle's running ground clearance.  Even the slowest current can push the heaviest vehicle downstream and out of control if the water is deep enough to push on the large surface area of the vehicle's body.  Before you proceed, determine the speed of the current, the water's depth, approach angle, bottom condition and if there are any obstacles.  Then cross at an angle heading slightly upstream using the low and slow technique.  WARNING: Never drive through fast moving deep water.  It can push your vehicle downstream, sweeping it out of control.  This could put you and your passengers at risk of injury or drowning.
