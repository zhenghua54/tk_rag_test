Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum permissible load on the front and rear axles.  The load must be distributed in the cargo area so that the GAWR of each axle is not exceeded.  Each axle GAWR is determined by the components in the system with the lowest load carrying capacity (axle, springs, tires or wheels).  Heavier axles or suspension components sometimes specified by purchasers for increased durability do not necessarily increase the vehicle's GVWR.  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) The GVWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle including driver, passengers, vehicle, options and cargo.  The label also specifies maximum capacities of front and rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR).  Total load must be limited so GVWR on front and rear GAWR are not exceeded.  Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) The GAWR is the maximum capacity of the front and rear axles.  Distribute the load over the front and rear axles evenly.  Make sure that you do not exceed either front or rear GAWR WARNING: It is important that you do not exceed the maximum front or rear GAWR.  A dangerous driving condition can result if either rating is exceeded.
