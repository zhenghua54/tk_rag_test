Four-Wheel Drive Low Range â€” This range provides low speed four-wheel drive.  It maximizes torque to the front driveshaft, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  This range provides additional traction and maximum pulling power for loose, slippery road surfaces only.  Do not exceed 25 mph (40 km/h).  2H (Two-Wheel Drive High Range) 4H (Four-Wheel Drive High Range) N (Neutral) 4L (Four-Wheel Drive Low Range) In the event that additional traction is required, the transfer case 4H and 4L positions can be used to lock the front and rear driveshafts together, forcing the front and rear wheels to rotate at the same speed.  The 4H and 4L positions are intended for loose, slippery road surfaces only and not intended for normal driving.  Driving in the 4H and 4L positions on hard-surfaced roads will cause increased tire wear and damage to the driveline components.  For further information on shifting into 4H or 4L
