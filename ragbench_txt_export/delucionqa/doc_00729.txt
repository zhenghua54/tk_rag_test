To utilize your manual transmission efficiently for both fuel economy and performance, it should be upshifted as listed in the recommended shift speed chart.  Shift at the vehicle speeds listed for acceleration.  When heavily loaded or pulling a trailer, these recommended up shift speeds may not apply.  Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or "chock" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: GVWR GTW GAWR Tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.
