Heated Steering Wheel â€” If Equipped The steering wheel contains a heating element that helps warm your hands in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel has only one temperature setting.  Once the heated steering wheel has been turned on, it will stay on until the operator turns it off.  The heated steering wheel may not turn on when it is already warm.  The heated steering wheel button is located on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, and within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen.  Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on.  Press the heated steering wheel button a second time to turn the heating element off.  For information on use with the Remote Start system, see Note: The engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate.  WARNING: Persons who are unable to feel pain to the skin because of advanced age, chronic illness, diabetes, spinal cord injury, medication, alcohol use, exhaustion, or other physical conditions must exercise care when using the steering wheel heater.  It may cause burns even at low temperatures, especially if used for long periods.  Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat, such as a blanket or steering wheel covers of any type and material.  This may cause the steering wheel heater to overheat.
