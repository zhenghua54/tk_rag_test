Engine Idling Avoid prolonged idling.  Long periods of idling may be harmful to your engine because combustion chamber temperatures can drop so low that the fuel may not burn completely.  Incomplete combustion allows carbon and varnish to form on piston rings, cylinder head valves, turbocharger, and injector nozzles.  Also, the unburned fuel can enter the crankcase, diluting the oil and causing rapid wear to the engine.
