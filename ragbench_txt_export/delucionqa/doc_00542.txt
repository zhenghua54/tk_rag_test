What Causes Corrosion?  Corrosion is the result of deterioration or removal of paint and protective coatings from your vehicle.  The most common causes are: road salt, dirt and moisture accumulation stone and gravel impact.  Insects, tree sap and tar.  Salt in the air near seacoast localities.  Atmospheric fallout/industrial pollutants.  Plastic And Coated Parts Use Mopar® Total Clean to clean vinyl upholstery.  CAUTION: Direct contact of air fresheners, insect repellents, suntan lotions, or hand sanitizers to the plastic, painted, or decorated surfaces of the interior may cause permanent damage.  Wipe away immediately.  Damage caused by these type of products may not be covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Special Care If you drive on salted or dusty roads or if you drive near the ocean, hose off the undercarriage at least once a month.  It is important that the drain holes in the lower edges of the doors, rocker panels, and trunk be kept clear and open.  If you detect any stone chips or scratches in the paint, touch them up immediately.  If your vehicle is damaged due to a collision or similar cause that destroys the paint and protective coating, have your vehicle repaired as soon as possible.  If you carry special cargo such as chemicals, fertilizers, de-icer salt, etc., be sure that such materials are well packaged and sealed.  If a lot of driving is done on gravel roads, consider mud or stone shields behind each wheel.  Use Mopar® Touch Up Paint on scratches as soon as possible.  An authorized dealer has touch up paint to match the color of your vehicle.
