The Locking Storage Bin has two keyed locks on the front of the bin and uses the same key as the glove compartment and the center console for your vehicle.  The Locking Storage Bin can be removed by unfastening the four bolts that attach the bin to the vehicle floor using the provided #40 Torx head driver and ratchet.  The bottom of the storage bin has rubber mats that need to be removed to access the four bolts.  These bolts can then be stored in the fastener bin below the rear seat.  Your Locking Storage Bin also has a front handle that makes it easier to carry and pull out from the floor of the vehicle when the four bolts that attach the bin to the floor are removed.
