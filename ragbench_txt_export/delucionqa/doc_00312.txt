Washing – use mopar® car wash or equivalent, or mild soap suds, lukewarm water, and a brush with soft bristles.  If extra cleaning is required, use Mopar® Convertible Cloth Top Cleaner or equivalent, or a mild foaming cleaner on the entire top, but support the top from underneath.  Wash your vehicle regularly.  Always wash your vehicle in the shade using Mopar® Car Wash, or a mild car wash soap, and rinse the panels completely with water.  If insects, tar, or other similar deposits have accumulated on your vehicle, use Mopar® Super Kleen Bug and Tar Remover to remove.  Use a high quality cleaner wax, such as Mopar® Cleaner Wax, to remove road film and stains, and to protect your paint finish.  Use precautions to not scratch the paint.  Avoid using abrasive compounds and power buffing that may diminish the gloss or thin out the paint finish.  All wheels and wheel trim, especially aluminum and chrome plated wheels, should be cleaned regularly using mild (neutral Ph) soap and water to maintain their luster and to prevent corrosion.  Wash wheels with the same soap solution recommended for the body of the vehicle, and remember to always wash when the surfaces are not hot to the touch.
