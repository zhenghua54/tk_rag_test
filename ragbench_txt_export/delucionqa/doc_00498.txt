Rolling Code Devices To determine if your device has a rolling code, a good indicator is its manufacturing date.  Typically, devices manufactured after 1995 have rolling codes.  A device with a rolling code will also have a “LEARN” or “TRAIN” button located where the antenna is attached to the device.  The button may not be immediately visible when looking at the device.  The name and color of the button may vary slightly by manufacturer.  Note: The “LEARN” or “TRAIN” button is not the button you normally use to operate the device.
