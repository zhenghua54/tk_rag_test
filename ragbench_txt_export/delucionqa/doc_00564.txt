To engage REVERSE gear from the NEUTRAL position, lift the REVERSE ring, located below the knob and move the gear selector all the way left and then forward.  If the gear selector cannot be moved to the PARK, REVERSE, or NEUTRAL position (when pushed forward), it is probably in the AutoStick (+/-) position (beside the DRIVE position).  In AutoStick mode, the transmission gear (1, 2, 3, etc.)  is displayed in the instrument cluster.  Move the gear selector to the right (into the DRIVE [D] position) for access to PARK, REVERSE, and NEUTRAL.  To shift the gears, fully press the clutch pedal and place the gear selector into the desired gear position (the diagram for the engagement of the gears is displayed on the handle of the selector).  The gear position will be displayed in the instrument cluster.
