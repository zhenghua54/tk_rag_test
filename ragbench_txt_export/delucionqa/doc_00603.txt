Adding Washer Fluid The fluid reservoir is located in the engine compartment.  Be sure to check the fluid level at regular intervals.  Fill the reservoir with windshield washer solvent only (not radiator antifreeze).  When refilling the washer fluid reservoir, take some washer fluid and apply it to a cloth or towel and wipe clean the wiper blades; this will help blade performance.  To prevent freeze-up of your windshield washer system in cold weather, select a solution or mixture that meets or exceeds the temperature range of your climate.  This rating information can be found on most washer fluid containers.  WARNING: Commercial windshield washer solvents are flammable.  They could ignite and burn you.  Care must be exercised when filling or working around the washer solution.
