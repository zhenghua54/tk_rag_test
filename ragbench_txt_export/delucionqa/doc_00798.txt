Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Active Warning Light â€” If Equipped This warning light will indicate when the Electronic Stability Control system is Active.  The ESC Indicator Light in the instrument cluster will come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, and when ESC is activated.  It should go out with the engine running.  If the ESC Indicator Light comes on continuously with the engine running, a malfunction has been detected in the ESC system.  If this warning light remains on after several ignition cycles, and the vehicle has been driven several miles (kilometers) at speeds greater than 30 mph (48 km/h), see an authorized dealer as soon as possible to have the problem diagnosed and corrected.  The ESC OFF Indicator Light and the ESC Indicator Light come on momentarily each time the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position.  The ESC system will make buzzing or clicking sounds when it is active.  This is normal; the sounds will stop when ESC becomes inactive.  This light will come on when the vehicle is in an ESC event.
