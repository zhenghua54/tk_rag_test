The Remote Door Lock/Unlock feature provides you the ability to lock or unlock the door on your vehicle without the keys and from virtually any distance.  All occupants must wear seat belts during off-road operation with doors removed.  For information on off-road driving tips, see Do not store detached doors inside of the vehicle, as they may cause personal injury in the event of an accident.  Assistance to remove doors may by required due to the weight of the door to avoid personal injury.  Avoid trapping anyone in a vehicle in a collision.  Remember that the rear doors can only be opened from the outside when the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged (locked).
