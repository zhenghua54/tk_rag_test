Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  After an accident, remember to cycle the ignition to the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position and remove the key from the ignition switch to avoid draining the battery.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  If there are no fuel leaks or damage to the vehicle electrical devices (e.g.  headlights) after an accident, reset the system by following the procedure described below.  If you have any doubt, contact an authorized dealer.  This warning light will illuminate, and a chime will sound, to indicate low engine oil pressure.  If the light and chime turn on while driving, safely stop the vehicle and turn off the engine as soon as possible.  After the vehicle is safely stopped, restart the engine and monitor the Oil Pressure Warning Light.  If the Oil Pressure Warning Light is still illuminated, turn the engine OFF and contact an authorized dealer for further assistance.  Do not operate the vehicle until the cause is corrected.  If the light is no longer illuminated, the engine can be operated but it is recommended to take the vehicle to an authorized dealer as soon as possible.
