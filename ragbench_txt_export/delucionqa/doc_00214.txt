Fuel that is contaminated by water or dirt can cause severe damage to the engine fuel system.  Proper maintenance of the engine fuel filter and fuel tank is essential see Damage to the fuel system or emission control system could result from using an improper fuel filler cap.  A poorly fitting cap could let impurities into the fuel system.  Also, a poorly fitting aftermarket cap can cause the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) to illuminate, due to fuel vapors escaping from the system.  To avoid fuel spillage and overfilling, do not “top off” the fuel tank after filling.  The fuel filler cap is located on the driver's side of the vehicle.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.
