Vehicles and other objects seen in the passenger side convex mirror will look smaller and farther away than they really are.  Relying too much on your passenger side mirror could cause you to collide with another vehicle or other object.  Use your inside mirror when judging the size or distance of a vehicle seen in the passenger side mirror.  The Outside Mirrors are located on the front driver and passenger side doors, and are adjusted manually or by power adjustment (if equipped).  If weather conditions are not a factor, the driver should examine the windshield and the camera located on the back side of the inside rearview mirror.  They may require cleaning or removal of an obstruction.  The Automatic Dimming Mirror feature is disabled when the vehicle is in REVERSE to improve the driverâ€™s rear view.
