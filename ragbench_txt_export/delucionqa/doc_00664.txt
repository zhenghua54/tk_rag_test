Extended Park Starting Install a battery charger or jumper cables to the battery to ensure a full battery charge during the crank cycle.  Press and hold the brake pedal while pushing the ENGINE START/STOP button once.  If the engine fails to start within 10 seconds, place the ignition in the OFF position, wait 10 to 15 seconds to allow the starter to cool, then repeat the “Extended Park Starting” procedure.  If the engine fails to start after eight attempts, allow the starter to cool for at least 10 minutes, then repeat the procedure.  Note: Extended Park condition occurs when the vehicle has not been started or driven for at least 30 days.  CAUTION: To prevent damage to the starter, do not crank continuously for more than 10 seconds at a time.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before trying again.
