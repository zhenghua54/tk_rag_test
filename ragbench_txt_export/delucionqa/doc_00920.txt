Engine Warm-Up Avoid full throttle operation when the engine is cold.  When starting a cold engine, bring the engine up to operating speed slowly to allow the oil pressure to stabilize as the engine warms up.  If temperatures are below 32°F (0°C), operate the engine at moderate speeds for five minutes before full loads are applied.  Possible Reasons The Engine Does Not Autostop Prior to engine shut down, the system will check many safety and comfort conditions to see if they are fulfilled.  Detailed information about the operation of the Stop/Start system may be viewed in the instrument cluster display Stop/Start Screen.  In the following situations, the engine will not stop: driver’s seat belt is not buckled driver’s door is not closed battery temperature is too warm or cold battery charge is low the vehicle is on a steep grade cabin heating or cooling is in process and an acceptable cabin temperature has not been achieved hvac is set to full defrost mode at a high blower speed hvac is set to max a/c engine has not reached normal operating temperature engine or exhaust temperature is too high the transmission is not in a forward gear hood is open transfer case is in 4l or n (neutral) brake pedal is not pressed with sufficient pressure accelerator pedal input vehicle speed threshold has not been achieved from previous autostop steering angle is beyond threshold acc is on and speed is set vehicle is at high altitude system fault is present it may be possible for the vehicle to be driven several times without the stop/start system going into a stop/start ready state under more extreme conditions of the items listed previously.  Conditions that will cause the engine to start automatically while in autostop mode: the transmission selector is moved out of drive to maintain cabin temperature comfort actual cabin temperature is significantly different than temperature set on auto hvac hvac is set to full defrost mode hvac system temperature or fan speed is manually adjusted battery voltage drops too low stop/start off switch is pushed a stop/start system error occurs stop/start autostop active time exceeds five minutes transfer case is in 4l or n (neutral) steering wheel is turned beyond threshold.
