A/C Button Push the A/C button to engage the Air Conditioning (A/C).  The A/C indicator illuminates when A/C is on.  Note: For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.
