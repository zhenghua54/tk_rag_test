Introducing Voice Recognition Start using Uconnect Voice Recognition with these helpful quick tips.  It provides the key Voice Commands and tips you need to know to control your vehicle’s Voice Recognition (VR) system.  If you see the NAV icon on the bottom bar or in the Apps menus of your 8.4-inch touchscreen, you have the Uconnect 4C NAV system.  If not, you have a Uconnect 4C with 8.4-inch display system.  Natural Speech Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine.  Natural speech allows the user to speak commands in phrases or complete sentences.  The system filters out certain non-word utterances and sounds such as “ah” and “eh.” The system handles fill-in words such as “I would like to”.  The system handles multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence such as “make a phone call” and “to Kelly Smith”.  For multiple inputs in the same phrase or sentence, the system identifies the topic or context and provides the associated follow-up prompt such as “Who do you want to call?” in the case where a phone call was requested but the specific name was not recognized.  The system utilizes continuous dialog.  When the system requires more information from the user, it will ask a question to which the user can respond without pushing the Voice Command button on the steering wheel.  Basic Voice Commands The following basic Voice Commands can be given at any point while using your Uconnect system.  Push the VR button After the beep, say: “ cancel ” to stop a current voice session.  “ help ” to hear a list of suggested voice commands.  “ repeat ” to listen to the system prompts again.  Notice the visual cues that inform you of your Voice Recognition system’s status.
