Under certain conditions, the mobile phone being on in your vehicle can cause erratic or noisy performance from your radio.  This condition may be lessened or eliminated by repositioning the mobile phone within the vehicle.  This condition is not harmful to the radio.  If your radio performance does not satisfactorily improve from repositioning the mobile phone, it is recommended that the volume be turned down or off during mobile phone operation when not using the Uconnect system.  Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the TPMS sensors.  Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting that affects radio wave signals.  Lots of snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.  Using tire chains on the vehicle.  Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPMS sensors.  The radio unit is acting as the amplifier for audio output from the Auxiliary device.  Therefore, if the volume control on the Auxiliary device is set too low, there will be insufficient audio signal for the radio unit to play the music on the device.
