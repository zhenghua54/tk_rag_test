If Engine Fails To Start If the engine fails to start after you have followed the “Normal Starting” procedure and the vehicle has not experienced an extended park condition as defined previously, it may be flooded.  Push the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor and hold it there.  Crank the engine for no more than 10 seconds.  This should clear any excess fuel in case the engine is flooded.  Leave the ignition key in the ON/ RUN position, release the accelerator pedal and repeat the “Normal Starting” procedure.  WARNING: Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle.  This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury.  Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started.  Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission cannot be started this way.  Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.  If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle.  This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly CAUTION: To prevent damage to the starter, do not continuously crank the engine for more than 10 seconds at a time.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before trying again.
