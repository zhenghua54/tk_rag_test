What to do when an electrical load reduction action message is present (“battery saver on” or “battery saver mode”) during a trip: reduce power to unnecessary loads if possible: turn off redundant lights (interior or exterior) check what may be plugged in to power outlets +12 volt, 115 volts ac, usb ports check hvac settings (blower, temperature) check the audio settings (volume) after a trip: check if any aftermarket equipment was installed (additional lights, upfitter electrical accessories, audio systems, alarms) and review specifications if any (load and ignition off draw currents).  Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.
