If the engine stalls or you lose headway or cannot make it to the top of a steep hill or grade, never attempt to turn around.  To do so may result in tipping and rolling the vehicle, which may result in severe injury.  Always back carefully straight down a hill in REVERSE.  Never back down a hill in NEUTRAL using only the vehicle brakes.  Never drive diagonally across a hill, always drive straight up or down.  When parking on a hill, apply the parking brake before shifting the transmission to PARK.  As an added precaution, turn the front wheels toward the curb on a downhill grade and away from the curb on an uphill grade.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When parking on a hill, it is important to turn the front wheels toward the curb on a downhill grade and away from the curb on an uphill grade.  For vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission, apply the parking brake before placing the gear selector in PARK, otherwise the load on the transmission locking mechanism may make it difficult to move the gear selector out of PARK.
