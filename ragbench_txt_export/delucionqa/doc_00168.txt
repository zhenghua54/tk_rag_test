Charging The Speaker Before using the Jeep® wireless speaker for the first time, fully charge your Jeep® wireless speaker until the battery indicator light stays solid green.  The Jeep® wireless speaker in-vehicle dock is the most ideal way to fully charge the speaker with the ignition in ON/RUN or ACC.  The speaker can also be charged with a power adapter.  To charge the Jeep® wireless speaker with a power adapter, insert the power adapter into a wall outlet.  Next, plug the power adapter into the Jeep® wireless speaker charging port on the back of the speaker.  Note: Jeep® wireless speaker will not charge within vehicle dock while the ignition is fully off.  Note: Power adapter needed for the Jeep® wireless speaker has to have a range of 14 VDC to 16.5 VDC, with a minimum of 2.7A and a barrel connector dimension of 5.5 mm by 2.5 mm.  Power adapter is not included.
