The BSM system notifies the driver of objects in the detection zones by illuminating the BSM Warning Light located in the outside mirrors in addition to sounding an audible (chime) alert and reducing the radio volume.  See "â‡¨blind spot modes" for further information.  The BSM system monitors the detection zone from three different entry points (side, rear, front) while driving to see if an alert is necessary.  The BSM system will issue an alert during these types of zone entries.  When the BSM system is turned off there will be no visual or audible alerts from either the BSM or RCP systems.  When the vehicle is started, the BSM Warning Light will momentarily illuminate in both outside rearview mirrors to let the driver know that the system is operational.  The BSM system sensors operate when the vehicle is in any forward gear.  The BSM detection zone covers approximately one lane width on both sides of the vehicle 12 ft (3.8 m).  The zone starts at the outside rearview mirror and extends approximately 10 ft (3 m) beyond the rear fascia/bumper of the vehicle.  The BSM system monitors the detection zones on both sides of the vehicle when the vehicle speed reaches approximately 6 mph (10 km/h) or higher and will alert the driver of vehicles in these areas.  BSM Radar Location (Left Side Shown) The BSM system will store the current operating mode when the vehicle is shut off.  Each time the vehicle is started the previously stored mode will be recalled and used.
