Preparations For Jacking Park on a firm, level surface.  Avoid ice or slippery areas.  Warning: do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic.  Pull far enough off the road to avoid being hit when operating the jack or changing the wheel.  Turn on the Hazard Warning Flashers.  Apply the parking brake.  Shift the automatic transmission into PARK (P), or a manual transmission into REVERSE.  Cycle the ignition to OFF.  Block both the front and rear of the wheel diagonally opposite of the jacking position.  For example, if the driver’s front wheel is being changed, block the passenger’s rear wheel.  Note: Passengers should not remain in the vehicle when the vehicle is being jacked in position.
