Transmission Temperature Warning Light â€” If Equipped This warning light will illuminate to warn of a high transmission fluid temperature.  This may occur with strenuous usage such as trailer towing.  If this light turns on, stop the vehicle and run the engine at idle or slightly faster, with the transmission in PARK (P) or NEUTRAL (N), until the light turns off.  Once the light turns off, you may continue to drive normally.  If Manual transmission equipped, this warning will illuminate to warn of high clutch temperature.  This may occur with driver misuse of clutch pedal or resting foot on the clutch pedal or partially engaging the clutch for longer duration.  If the light turns on, it will be with an additional CLUTCH HOT message.  Stop the vehicle safely and run the engine at idle with transmission gear in NEUTRAL (N) until the light turns off.  Once the light turns off, follow the message displayed in the instrument cluster.  WARNING: If you continue operating the vehicle when the Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated you could cause the fluid to boil over, come in contact with hot engine or exhaust components and cause a fire.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause a fire.  CAUTION: Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.
