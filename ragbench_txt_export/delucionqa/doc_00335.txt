When the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged, the door can be opened only by using the outside door handle, even though the inside door lock is in the unlocked position.  After disengaging the Child-Protection Door Lock system, always test the door from the inside to make certain it is in the unlocked position.  After engaging the Child-Protection Door Lock system, always test the door from the inside to make certain it is in the locked position.  For emergency exit with the system engaged, move the lock lever rearward (located on the door trim panel), lower the window and open the door with the outside door handle.  Always use this device when carrying children.  After engaging the child lock on both rear doors, check for effective engagement by trying to open a door with the internal handle.  Once the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged, it is impossible to open the doors from inside the vehicle.  Before getting out of the vehicle, be sure to check that there is no one left inside.  Avoid trapping anyone in a vehicle in a collision.  Remember that the rear doors can only be opened from the outside when the Child-Protection Door Lock system is engaged (locked).
