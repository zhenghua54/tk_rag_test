Removing The Rear Window And Quarter Panel Cover Assemblies Start by removing the rear window first.  Use the two straps located on the bottom of each side of the rear window to remove the right and left vertical retainers, as well as the lower center retainer.  Step one (right side shown) step one while keeping the rear window level, slide it outward in either direction until it is completely separate from its retainer.  Do not pull downward while removing the rear window.  Damage to the retainer could result.  Store the rear window in the soft top rear window storage bag (if equipped), or in a safe location Step two after removing the rear window, remove the quarter panel cover assemblies starting with either side.  Disengage the quarter panel cover assembly from the bottom by pulling the fabric at the bottom upward.  With two hands, grab the front of the quarter panel cover assembly and pull outward to disengage it from its retainer on the door frame.  Step four pull the quarter panel cover assembly up and out from the bottom, then pull it down and away from the vehicle to remove.  Step five repeat this procedure for the other quarter panel cover assembly.  Store the assemblies in the soft top rear window storage bag (if equipped), or a safe location.  Note: both quarter panel cover assemblies and the rear window must all be removed together, or installed together.
