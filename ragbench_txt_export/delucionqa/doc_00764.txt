Locking Storage Bin If equipped, the Locking Storage Bin is located below the rear seats.  It can be accessed by folding the rear seat bottom upward into the Stadium Position.  The Locking Storage Bin has two keyed locks on the front of the bin and uses the same key as the glove compartment and the center console for your vehicle.  Inside the bin are three removable dividers to set up storage that works best for you.  The Locking Storage Bin can be removed by unfastening the four bolts that attach the bin to the vehicle floor using the provided #40 Torx head driver and ratchet.  The bottom of the storage bin has rubber mats that need to be removed to access the four bolts.  These bolts can then be stored in the fastener bin below the rear seat.  Your Locking Storage Bin also has a front handle that makes it easier to carry and pull out from the floor of the vehicle when the four bolts that attach the bin to the floor are removed.  Console Storage Compartment The center console has both an upper and lower storage compartment.  To open the upper storage compartment, lift the top latch.  To access the lower storage compartment, lift the bottom latch.
