When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts off, the fuel tank is full.  Tighten the fuel filler cap about a quarter turn until you hear one click.  This is an indication that the cap is properly tightened.  If the fuel filler cap is not tightened properly, the MIL will come on.  Be sure the cap is tightened every time the vehicle is refueled.  After fuel has been added, the vehicle diagnostic system can determine if the fuel filler cap is possibly loose, improperly installed, or damaged.  If the system detects a malfunction, the “gASCAP” message will display in the odometer display.  Tighten the gas cap until a "clicking" sound is heard.  This is an indication that the gas cap is properly tightened.  Push the odometer reset button to turn the message off.  If the problem persists, the message will appear the next time the vehicle is started.  This might indicate a damaged cap.  If the problem is detected twice in a row, the system will turn on the MIL.  Resolving the problem will turn the MIL off.  The fuel filler cap is located on the left side of the vehicle.  To access the fuel filler cap, push on the fuel filler door to unlatch it.  To close the fuel filler door, push on it a second time.  If the fuel filler cap is lost or damaged, be sure the replacement cap is the correct one for this vehicle.
