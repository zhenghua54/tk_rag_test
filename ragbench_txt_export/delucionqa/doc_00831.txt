The tilt/telescoping control is located below the steering wheel at the end of the steering column.  To unlock the steering column, push the control downward (toward the floor).  To tilt the steering column, move the steering wheel upward or downward as desired.  To lengthen or shorten the steering column, pull the steering wheel outward or push it inward as desired.  To lock the steering column in position, push the control upward until fully engaged.  WARNING: Do not adjust the steering column while driving.  Adjusting the steering column while driving or driving with the steering column unlocked, could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.  Failure to follow this warning may result in serious injury or death.
