Provided Tools For your convenience, a tool kit is provided with your vehicle located in the center console.  This kit includes the necessary tools required for the operations described in the following sections.  All pieces fit into the ratchet for easy use.  If your vehicle is equipped with a Dual Top, the soft top system will be provided in a separate box located in the bed of the vehicle for shipping purposes only.  Note: The soft top and the hard top are to be used independently.  Your vehicle warranty will not cover damage resulting from both tops being installed at the same time.  Getting High-Centered If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  CAUTION: Winching or rocking the vehicle off hard objects increases the risk of underbody damage.
