Wind buffeting can be described as the perception of pressure on the ears or a helicopter-type sound in the ears.  Your vehicle may exhibit wind buffeting with the windows down, or the sunroof (if equipped) in certain open or partially open positions.  This is a normal occurrence and can be minimized.  If the buffeting occurs with the rear windows open, open the front and rear windows together to minimize the buffeting.  If the buffeting occurs with the sunroof open, adjust the sunroof opening to minimize the buffeting or open any window.  Head restraints are designed to reduce the risk of injury by restricting head movement in the event of a rear impact.  Head restraints should be adjusted so that the top of the head restraint is located above the top of your ear.  This feature notifies the user when the placard tire pressure is attained while inflating or deflating the tire.
