This is why you should always talk to an authorized dealerâ€™s service manager first.  If for some reason you are still not satisfied, talk to the general manager or owner of the authorized dealer.  They want to know if you need assistance.  If an authorized dealer is unable to resolve the concern, you may contact FCA US LLC's Customer Assistance center.  We recommend seeing an authorized dealer for service.  An authorized dealer has the qualified service personnel, special tools, and equipment to perform all service operations in an expert manner.  Service Manuals are available which include detailed service information for your vehicle.  Refer to these Service Manuals before attempting any procedure yourself.  If the transmission cannot be reset, authorized dealer service is required.
