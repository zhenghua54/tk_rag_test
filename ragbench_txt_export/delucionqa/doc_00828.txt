Intermittent Wipers Use the intermittent wiper when weather conditions make a single wiping cycle, with a variable pause between cycles, desirable.  Rotate the end of the lever to the first detent position for one of four intermittent settings.  The delay cycle can be set anywhere between 1 to 18 seconds.  Note: The wiper delay times depend on vehicle speed.  If the vehicle is moving less than 10 mph (16 km/h), delay times will be doubled.
