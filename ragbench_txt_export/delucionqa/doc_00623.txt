Mist Push upward on the wiper lever to activate a single wipe to clear off-road mist or spray from a passing vehicle.  As long as the lever is held up, the wipers will continue to operate.  For information on wiper care and replacement, see Note: The mist feature does not activate the washer pump; therefore, no washer fluid will be sprayed on the windshield.  The washer function must be used in order to spray the windshield with washer fluid.
