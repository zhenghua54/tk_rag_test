Setting Name Description Language This setting will change the language of the Uconnect system and Instrument Cluster Display.  The available languages are “English”, “Français”, and “Español”.  Your Uconnect Phone Voice system uses a Natural Language Voice Recognition (VR) engine.  Press the Media button on the touchscreen to begin.  Change the source to “Bluetooth®”.  Press the Bluetooth® button on the touchscreen to display the Paired Audio Devices screen.  Press the Add Device button on the touchscreen.  If there is no device currently connected with the system, a pop-up will appear.  Search for available devices on your Bluetooth®-enabled audio device.  When prompted on the device, confirm the PIN shown on the Uconnect screen.  Uconnect Phone will display an in-process screen while the system is connecting.  When the pairing process has successfully completed, the system will prompt you to choose whether or not this is your favorite device.  Selecting “Yes” will make this device the highest priority.  This device will take precedence over other paired devices within range.  Uconnect Phone allows you to transfer calls between the system and your mobile phone as you enter or exit your vehicle and enables you to mute the system's microphone for private conversation.
