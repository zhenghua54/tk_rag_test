Reformulated Gasoline Many areas of the country require the use of cleaner-burning gasoline referred to as “reformulated gasoline”.  Reformulated gasoline contains oxygenates and are specifically blended to reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality.  The use of reformulated gasoline is recommended.  Properly blended reformulated gasoline will provide improved performance and durability of engine and fuel system components.  Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) In Gasoline MMT is a manganese-containing metallic additive that is blended into some gasolines to increase octane.  Gasoline blended with MMT provides no performance advantage beyond gasoline of the same octane number without MMT.  Gasoline blended with MMT reduces spark plug life and reduces emissions system performance in some vehicles.  The manufacturer recommends that gasoline without MMT be used in your vehicle.  The MMT content of gasoline may not be indicated on the gasoline pump; therefore, you should ask your gasoline retailer whether the gasoline contains MMT.  MMT is prohibited in Federal law and California reformulated gasoline.  Gasoline/Oxygenate Blends Some fuel suppliers blend unleaded gasoline with oxygenates such as ethanol.  Problems that result from using gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15) or gasoline containing methanol are not the responsibility of the manufacturer and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  CAUTION: DO NOT use E-85, gasoline containing methanol, or gasoline containing more than 15% ethanol (E-15).  Use of these blends may result in starting and drivability problems, damage critical fuel system components, cause emissions to exceed the applicable standard, and/or cause the Malfunction Indicator Light to illuminate.  Please observe pump labels as they should clearly communicate if a fuel contains greater than 15% ethanol (E-15).
