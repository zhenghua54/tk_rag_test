The steering wheel contains a heating element that helps warm your hands in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel has only one temperature setting.  Once the heated steering wheel has been turned on, it will stay on until the operator turns it off.  The heated steering wheel may not turn on when it is already warm.  Persons who are unable to feel pain to the skin because of advanced age, chronic illness, diabetes, spinal cord injury, medication, alcohol use, exhaustion, or other physical conditions must exercise care when using the steering wheel heater.  It may cause burns even at low temperatures, especially if used for long periods.  Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat, such as a blanket or steering wheel covers of any type and material.  This may cause the steering wheel heater to overheat.  The heated steering wheel button is located on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, and within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen.  When Remote Start is activated, the front and rear defrost will automatically turn on in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel and driver heated seat feature will also turn on if programmed in the Comfort menu screen within Uconnect Settings Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on.  Press the heated steering wheel button a second time to turn the heating element off.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate.
