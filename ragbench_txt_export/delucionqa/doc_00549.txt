The diesel engine does not require a break-in period due to its construction.  Normal operation is allowed, providing the following recommendations are followed: A new engine may consume some oil during its first few thousand miles (kilometers) of operation.  This should be considered a normal part of the break-in and not interpreted as a problem.  A long break-in period is not required for the engine and drivetrain (transmission and axle) in your vehicle.
