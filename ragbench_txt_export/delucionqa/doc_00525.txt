WHEEL AND TIRE TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS Proper lug nut/bolt torque is very important to ensure that the wheel is properly mounted to the vehicle.  Any time a wheel has been removed and reinstalled on the vehicle, the lug nuts/bolts should be torqued using a properly calibrated torque wrench using a six-sided (hex) deep wall socket.
