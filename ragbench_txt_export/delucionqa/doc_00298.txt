However, you can create conditions where the system will give you a false alarm.  If one of the previously described arming sequences has occurred, the Vehicle Security system will arm regardless of whether you are in the vehicle or not.  If you remain in the vehicle and open a door, the alarm will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  If the Vehicle Security system is armed and the battery becomes disconnected, the Vehicle Security system will remain armed when the battery is reconnected; the exterior lights will flash, and the horn will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  Note: The driver's door key cylinder cannot arm or disarm the Vehicle Security system.  When the Vehicle Security system is armed, the interior power door lock switches will not unlock the doors.
