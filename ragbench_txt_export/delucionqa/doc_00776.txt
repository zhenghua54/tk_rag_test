Inspect engine air cleaner filter if using in dusty or off-road conditions, replace engine air cleaner filter if necessary.  The engine oil filter should be replaced with a new filter at every engine oil change.  A full-flow type disposable oil filter should be used for replacement.  The quality of replacement filter varies considerably.  We recommend using a Mopar® engine oil filter, if a Mopar® engine oil filter is unavailable only use filters that meet or exceed SAE/USCAR-36 Filter performance requirements.
