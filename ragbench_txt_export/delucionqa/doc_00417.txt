Child Restraints Everyone in your vehicle needs to be buckled up at all times, including babies and children.  Every state in the United States, and every Canadian province, requires that small children ride in proper restraint systems.  This is the law, and you can be prosecuted for ignoring it.  Children 12 years or younger should ride properly buckled up in a rear seat, if available.  According to crash statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats rather than in the front.  There are different sizes and types of restraints for children from newborn size to the child almost large enough for an adult safety belt.  Always check the child seat Owner’s Manual to make sure you have the correct seat for your child.  Carefully read and follow all the instructions and warnings in the child restraint Owner’s Manual and on all the labels attached to the child restraint.  Before buying any restraint system, make sure that it has a label certifying that it meets all applicable Safety Standards.  You should also make sure that you can install it in the vehicle where you will use it.  WARNING: In a collision, an unrestrained child can become a projectile inside the vehicle.  The force required to hold even an infant on your lap could become so great that you could not hold the child, no matter how strong you are.  The child and others could be badly injured or killed.  Any child riding in your vehicle should be in a proper restraint for the child’s size.
