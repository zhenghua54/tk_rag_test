Turn Signal Indicator Lights When the left or right turn signal is activated, the turn signal indicator will flash independently and the corresponding exterior turn signal lamps will flash.  Turn signals can be activated when the multifunction lever is moved down (left) or up (right).  Note: A continuous chime will sound if the vehicle is driven more than 1 mile (1.6 km) with either turn signal on.  Check for an inoperative outside light bulb if either indicator flashes at a rapid rate.
