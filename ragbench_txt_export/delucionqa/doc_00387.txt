Outside Mirrors The Outside Mirrors are located on the front driver and passenger side doors, and are adjusted manually or by power adjustment (if equipped).  To receive maximum benefit, adjust the Outside Mirror(s) to center on the adjacent lane of traffic with a slight overlap of the view obtained on the inside mirror.  For information on the Door Off Mirror Kit (if equipped) when the front doors are removed, see WARNING: Vehicles and other objects seen in the passenger side convex mirror will look smaller and farther away than they really are.  Relying too much on your passenger side mirror could cause you to collide with another vehicle or other object.  Use your inside mirror when judging the size or distance of a vehicle seen in the passenger side mirror.
