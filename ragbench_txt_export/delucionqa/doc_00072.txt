Vehicles sold in Canada are equipped with a headlight switch with an AUTO and ON detent but without an OFF detent.  Headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position.  However, the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) will be activated along with the front and rear marker lights.  The DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged.  For vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.  On some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate, or reduce intensity, on one side of the vehicle (when a turn signal is activated on that side), or on both sides of the vehicle (when the hazard warning lights are activated).  The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are in a dedicated position below the headlight assembly.  DRLs are active when the low beams are not on while the vehicleâ€™s transmission is in any position (automatic transmission), or when the vehicle begins to move (manual transmission).  BeltAlert can be activated or deactivated by an authorized dealer.  FCA US LLC does not recommend deactivating BeltAlert.
