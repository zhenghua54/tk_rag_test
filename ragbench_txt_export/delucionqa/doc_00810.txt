Fuel/Water Separator Filter Do not drain the fuel/water separator filter when the engine is running.  Diesel fuel will damage blacktop paving surfaces.  Drain the filter into an appropriate container.  If the Water in Fuel Indicator Light remains on, DO NOT START engine before you drain the water from the fuel filter(s) to avoid engine damage
