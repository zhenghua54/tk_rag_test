Frequency Operated Button Integrated Key (FOBIK-Safe) To minimize the possibility of unintentionally locking a Passive Entry key fob inside your vehicle, the Passive Entry system is equipped with an automatic door unlock feature which will function only if the ignition switch is in the OFF position.  FOBIK-Safe only executes in vehicles with Passive Entry.  There are three situations that trigger a FOBIK-Safe search in any Passive Entry vehicle: A lock request is made by a valid Passive Entry key fob while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the Passive Entry door handle while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the door panel switch while the door is open.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  Note: The vehicle will only unlock the doors during a FOBIK-Safe operation when a valid Passive Entry key fob is detected inside the vehicle.  The vehicle will not unlock the doors when any of the following conditions are true: A second valid Passive Entry key fob is detected outside of the vehicle (within 5 ft (1.5 m) of a Passive Entry door handle).  The doors are manually locked using the door lock knobs.  Three attempts are made to lock the doors using the door panel switch, and then the doors are closed.
