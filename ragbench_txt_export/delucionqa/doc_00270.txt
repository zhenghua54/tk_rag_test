FUEL REQUIREMENTS â€” GASOLINE ENGINE While operating on gasoline with the required octane number, hearing a light knocking sound from the engine is not a cause for concern.  However, if the engine is heard making a heavy knocking sound, see an authorized dealer immediately.  Use of gasoline with an octane number lower than recommended can cause engine failure and may void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Poor quality gasoline can cause problems such as hard starting, stalling, and hesitations.  If you experience these symptoms, try another brand of gasoline before considering service for the vehicle.  Do Not Operate The Engine With Failed Parts All engine failures give some warning before the parts fail.  Be on the alert for changes in performance, sounds, and visual evidence that the engine requires service.  Some important clues are: engine misfiring or vibrating severely sudden loss of power unusual engine noises fuel, oil or coolant leaks sudden change, outside the normal operating range, in the engine operating temperature excessive smoke oil pressure drop shifting fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.
