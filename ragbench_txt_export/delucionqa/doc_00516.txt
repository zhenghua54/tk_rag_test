A cancel message will display on the instrument cluster display and produce a warning chime.  Driver intervention will be required at this moment.  The specified following distance for ACC can be set by varying the distance setting between four bars (longest), three bars (long), two bars (medium) and one bar (short).  Using this distance setting and the vehicle speed, ACC calculates and sets the distance to the vehicle ahead.  This distance setting displays in the instrument cluster display.
