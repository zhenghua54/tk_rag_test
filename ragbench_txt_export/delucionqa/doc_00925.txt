Recommended Distribution Hitch Adjustment Position the truck to be ready to connect to the trailer (do not connect the trailer).  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H1.  Measuring height (h) attach the trailer to the vehicle without the weight distribution bars connected.  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H2.  Install and adjust the tension in the weight distributing bars per the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations so that the height of the front fender is approximately H1 (H2=H1).  The truck can now be driven.
