On-Road Driving Tips Utility vehicles have higher ground clearance and a narrower track to make them capable of performing in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Specific design characteristics give them a higher center of gravity than conventional passenger cars.  An advantage of the higher ground clearance is a better view of the road, allowing you to anticipate problems.  They are not designed for cornering at the same speeds as conventional passenger cars any more than low-slung sports cars are designed to perform satisfactorily in off-road conditions.  Avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers.  As with other vehicles of this type, failure to operate this vehicle correctly may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover.
