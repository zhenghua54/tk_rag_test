Full Off — If Equipped This mode is intended for off-highway or off-road use only and should not be used on any public roadways.  In this mode, TCS and ESC features are turned off.  To enter the “Full Off” mode, push and hold the ESC OFF button for five seconds while the vehicle is stopped with the engine running.  After five seconds, a chime will sound, the ESC OFF Indicator Light will illuminate, and the “ESC OFF” message will display in the instrument cluster.  To turn ESC on again, momentarily push the ESC OFF button.  If equipped with Off Road+ and if Off Road+ is active when "Full Off" mode is enabled by the driver, ESC will not switch to "Partial Off" mode at any speed and will remain in "Full Off" mode until Off Road+ is exited or ESC is re-enabled by the driver.  Note: System may switch from ESC “Full Off” to “Partial Off” mode when vehicle exceeds a predetermined speed.  When the vehicle speed slows below the predetermined speed the system will return to ESC “Full Off”.  WARNING: In the ESC “Full Off” mode, the engine torque reduction and stability features are disabled.  Therefore, enhanced vehicle stability offered by the ESC system is unavailable.  In an emergency evasive maneuver, the ESC system will not engage to assist in maintaining stability.  ESC “Full Off” mode is intended for off-highway or off-road use only.  The Electronic Stability Control (ESC) cannot prevent the natural laws of physics from acting on the vehicle, nor can it increase the traction afforded by prevailing road conditions.  ESC cannot prevent all accidents, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, driving on very slippery surfaces, or hydroplaning.  ESC also cannot prevent collisions.
