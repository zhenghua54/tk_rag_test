Rim Size This is the rim size that is appropriate for the tire size listed.  Tire Size The tire size on the Vehicle Certification Label represents the actual tire size on your vehicle.  Replacement tires must be equal to the load capacity of this tire size.  Example: example size designation: p215/65r15xl 95h, 215/65r15 96h, lt235/85r16c, t145/80d18 103m, 31x10.5 r15 lt p = passenger car tire size based on us design standards, or "....blank...." = passenger car tire based on european design standards, or lt = light truck tire based on us design standards, or t or s = temporary spare tire, or 31 = overall diameter in inches (in) 215, 235, 145 = section width in millimeters (mm) 65, 85, 80 = aspect ratio in percent (%) ratio of section height to section width of tire, or 10.5 = section width in inches (in) r = construction code "r" means radial construction, or "d" means diagonal or bias construction 15, 16, 18 = rim diameter in inches (in) service description: 95 = load index a numerical code associated with the maximum load a tire can carry h = speed symbol a symbol indicating the range of speeds at which a tire can carry a load corresponding to its load index under certain operating conditions the maximum speed corresponding to the speed symbol should only be achieved under specified operating conditions (i.e., tire pressure, vehicle loading, road conditions, and posted speed limits) load identification: absence of the following load identification symbols on the sidewall of the tire indicates a standard load (sl) tire: xl = extra load (or reinforced) tire, or ll = light load tire or c, d, e, f, g = load range associated with the maximum load a tire can carry at a specified pressure maximum load – maximum load indicates the maximum load this tire is designed to carry maximum pressure – maximum pressure indicates the maximum permissible cold tire inflation pressure for this tire.
