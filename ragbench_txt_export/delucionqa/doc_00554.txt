ENGINE BREAK-IN RECOMMENDATIONS â€” DIESEL ENGINE (IF EQUIPPED) The diesel engine does not require a break-in period due to its construction.  Normal operation is allowed, providing the following recommendations are followed: Warm up the engine before placing it under load.  Do not operate the engine at idle for prolonged periods.  Use the appropriate transmission gear to prevent engine lugging.  Observe vehicle oil pressure and temperature indicators.  Check the coolant and oil levels frequently.  Vary throttle position at highway speeds when carrying or towing significant weight.  The engine oil installed in the engine at the factory is a high-quality energy conserving type lubricant.  Oil changes should be consistent with anticipated climate conditions under which vehicle operations will occur.  For recommended viscosity and quality gradesNON-DETERGENT OR STRAIGHT MINERAL OILS MUST NEVER BE USED.  Note: Light duty operation such as light trailer towing or no load operation will extend the time before the engine is at full efficiency.  Reduced fuel economy and power may be seen at this time.
