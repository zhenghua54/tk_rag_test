Extreme Cold Weather The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.  It requires a 110–115 Volt AC electrical outlet with a grounded, three-wire extension cord.  Its use is recommended for environments that routinely fall below -10°F (-23°C).  It should be used when the vehicle has not been running overnight or longer periods and should be plugged in two hours prior to start.  Its use is required for cold starts with temperatures under -20°F (-28°C).  A 12 Volt heater built into the fuel filter housing aids in preventing fuel gelling.  It is controlled by a built-in thermostat.  A Diesel Pre-Heat system both improves engine starting and reduces the amount of white smoke generated by a warming engine.  Note: The engine block heater and heater cord are factory installed options.  If your vehicle is not equipped, engine block heaters and heater cords are available from an authorized Mopar® dealer.
