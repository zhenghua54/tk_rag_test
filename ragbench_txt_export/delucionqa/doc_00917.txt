Towing Service Our towing service gives you peace of mind and confidence.  If your vehicle becomes disabled as a result of a mechanical breakdown, Roadside Assistance will dispatch a towing service to transport your vehicle to the closest authorized Chrysler, Dodge, JeepÂ®, or Ram dealer.  If you choose to go to another dealer, you will be responsible for the cost if the extra distance exceeds 10 miles.
