Washing Wash your vehicle regularly.  Always wash your vehicle in the shade using Mopar® Car Wash, or a mild car wash soap, and rinse the panels completely with water.  If insects, tar, or other similar deposits have accumulated on your vehicle, use Mopar® Super Kleen Bug and Tar Remover to remove.  Use a high quality cleaner wax, such as Mopar® Cleaner Wax, to remove road film and stains, and to protect your paint finish.  Use precautions to not scratch the paint.  Avoid using abrasive compounds and power buffing that may diminish the gloss or thin out the paint finish.  CAUTION: Do not use abrasive or strong cleaning materials, such as steel wool or scouring powder, that will scratch metal and painted surfaces.  Use of power washers exceeding 1,200 psi (8,274 kPa) can result in damage or removal of paint and decals.
