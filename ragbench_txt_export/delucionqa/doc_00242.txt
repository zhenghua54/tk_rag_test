The Roof Luggage Rack is designed to allow for carrying an additional cargo load on vehicles equipped with a Hard Top.  The load carried on the roof, when equipped with a luggage rack, must not exceed 100 lb (45 kg), this includes the weight of the crossbars, and it should be uniformly distributed over the cargo area.  Cargo must be securely tied down before driving your vehicle.  Improperly secured loads can fly off the vehicle, particularly at high speeds, resulting in personal injury or property damage.  Follow the roof rack cautions when carrying cargo on your roof rack.  To avoid damage to the roof rack and vehicle, do not exceed the maximum roof rack load capacity.  Always distribute heavy loads as evenly as possible and secure the load appropriately.  Long loads, which extend over the windshield, should be secured to both the front and rear of the vehicle.  Place a blanket or other protection between the surface of the roof and the load.  Travel at reduced speeds and turn corners carefully when carrying large or heavy loads on the roof rack.  Wind forces, due to natural causes or nearby truck traffic, can add sudden upward lift.  It is recommended to not carry large flat loads, such as wood panels or surfboards, which may result in damage to the cargo or your vehicle.  Load should always be secured to crossbars first, with tie down loops used as additional securing points if needed.  Tie loops are intended as supplementary tie down points only.  Do not use ratcheting mechanisms with the tie loops.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.
