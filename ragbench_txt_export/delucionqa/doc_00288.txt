Wind Buffeting Wind buffeting can be described as the perception of pressure on the ears or a helicopter-type sound in the ears.  Your vehicle may exhibit wind buffeting with the windows down, or the sunroof (if equipped) in certain open or partially open positions.  This is a normal occurrence and can be minimized.  If the buffeting occurs with the rear windows open, open the front and rear windows together to minimize the buffeting.  If the buffeting occurs with the sunroof open, adjust the sunroof opening to minimize the buffeting or open any window.
