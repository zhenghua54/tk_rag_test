ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up.
