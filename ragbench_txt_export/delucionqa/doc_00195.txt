On the highways — slow down.  In city traffic — while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately.
