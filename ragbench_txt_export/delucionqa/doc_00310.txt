Opening The Hood Release both of the outside hood latches.  Raise the hood slightly, and place a hand palm-side down in the center of the hood opening.  Locate the safety latch in the middle, and push the latch to the right to open.  Remove the support rod from the hood, and insert it into the radiator crossmember.  Note: Vehicle must be at a stop and the gear selector must be in PARK.  You may have to push down slightly on the hood before pushing the safety latch.  While lifting the hood, use both hands.  Before lifting the hood, check that the wiper arms are not in motion and not in the lifted position.
