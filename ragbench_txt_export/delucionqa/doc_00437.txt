Loading The vehicle maximum load on the tire must not exceed the load carrying capacity of the tire on your vehicle.  You will not exceed the tire's load carrying capacity if you adhere to the loading conditions, tire size, and cold tire inflation pressures specified on the Tire And Loading Information Placard To determine the maximum loading conditions of your vehicle, locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs” on the Tire And Loading Information Placard.  The combined weight of occupants, cargo/luggage and trailer tongue weight (if applicable) should never exceed the weight referenced here.  Note: Under a maximum loaded vehicle condition, gross axle weight ratings (GAWRs) for the front and rear axles must not be exceeded.
