Trac-Lok Rear Axle â€” If Equipped The Trac-Lok rear axle provides a constant driving force to both rear wheels and reduces wheel spin caused by the loss of traction at one driving wheel.  If traction differs between the two rear wheels, the differential automatically proportions the usable torque by providing more torque to the wheel that has traction.  Trac-Lok is especially helpful during slippery driving conditions.  With both rear wheels on a slippery surface, a slight application of the accelerator will supply maximum traction.  WARNING: On vehicles equipped with a limited-slip differential, never run the engine with one rear wheel off the ground.  The vehicle may drive through the rear wheel remaining on the ground and cause you to lose control of your vehicle.
