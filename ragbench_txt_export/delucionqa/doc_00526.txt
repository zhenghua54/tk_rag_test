Torque Specifications **Use only authorized dealer recommended lug nuts/bolts and clean or remove any dirt or oil before tightening.  Inspect the wheel mounting surface prior to mounting the tire and remove any corrosion or loose particles.  Tighten the lug nuts/bolts in a star pattern until each nut/bolt has been tightened twice.  Ensure that the socket is fully engaged on the lug nut/bolt (do not insert it halfway).  After 25 miles (40 km), check the lug nut/bolt torque to be sure that all the lug nuts/bolts are properly seated against the wheel.  WARNING: To avoid the risk of forcing the vehicle off the jack, do not tighten the lug nuts/bolts fully until the vehicle has been lowered.  Failure to follow this warning may result in personal injury.  WHEEL AND TIRE TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS Proper lug nut/bolt torque is very important to ensure that the wheel is properly mounted to the vehicle.  Any time a wheel has been removed and reinstalled on the vehicle, the lug nuts/bolts should be torqued using a properly calibrated torque wrench using a six-sided (hex) deep wall socket.
