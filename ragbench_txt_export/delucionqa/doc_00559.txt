Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) The GVWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle including driver, passengers, vehicle, options and cargo.  The label also specifies maximum capacities of front and rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR).  Total load must be limited so GVWR on front and rear GAWR are not exceeded.
