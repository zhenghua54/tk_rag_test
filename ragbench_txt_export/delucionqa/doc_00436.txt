While the Cruise Control is set, press the accelerator to pass as you would normally.  When the pedal is released, the vehicle will return to the set speed.  When engaged, the Cruise Control system takes over accelerator operations at speeds greater than 20 mph (32 km/h).  Do not use in hilly terrain or with heavy loads.  When using the Cruise Control, if you experience speed drops greater than 10 mph (16 km/h), disengage until you can get back to cruising speed.  Use Cruise Control in flat terrain and with light loads to maximize fuel efficiency.  To turn the system off, push and release the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) on/off button again.  At this time, the system will turn off and the instrument cluster display will read “Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) Off.”
