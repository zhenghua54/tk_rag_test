Whenever the Rear View Camera image is activated through the Back Up Camera button in the Controls menu, and the vehicle speed is greater than, or equal to 8 mph (13 km/h), a display timer for the image is initiated.  The image will continue to be displayed until the display timer exceeds 10 seconds.  Different colored zones indicate the distance to the rear of the vehicle.  The ParkView Rear Back Up Camera allows you to see an on-screen image of the rear surroundings of your vehicle whenever the gear selector is in REVERSE.  The image will be displayed in the touchscreen display along with a caution note to “Check Entire Surroundings” across the top of the screen.  After five seconds this note will disappear.  The ParkView camera is located on the tailgate, above the vehicle license plate.
