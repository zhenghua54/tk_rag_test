To avoid damage to the roof rack and vehicle, do not exceed the maximum roof rack load capacity.  Always distribute heavy loads as evenly as possible and secure the load appropriately.  Long loads, which extend over the windshield, should be secured to both the front and rear of the vehicle.  Place a blanket or other protection between the surface of the roof and the load.  Travel at reduced speeds and turn corners carefully when carrying large or heavy loads on the roof rack.  Wind forces, due to natural causes or nearby truck traffic, can add sudden upward lift.  It is recommended to not carry large flat loads, such as wood panels or surfboards, which may result in damage to the cargo or your vehicle.  Load should always be secured to crossbars first, with tie down loops used as additional securing points if needed.  Tie loops are intended as supplementary tie down points only.  Do not use ratcheting mechanisms with the tie loops.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  Crossbars should always be used whenever cargo is placed on the roof rack.  Check the straps frequently to be sure that the load remains securely attached.  The front panel(s) must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The hard top assembly must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The hard top is not designed to carry any additional loads, such as after-market roof racks, spare tires, building materials, hunting or camping supplies, etc.  T Do not move your vehicle until the top has been either fully attached to the windshield frame and body, or fully removed.  The removal of the hard top requires four adults located on each corner.  Failure to follow this caution could damage the hard top.
