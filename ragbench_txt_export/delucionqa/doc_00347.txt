ParkSense Sensors The four ParkSense sensors, located in the rear fascia/bumper, monitor the area behind the vehicle that is within the sensors’ field of view.  The sensors can detect obstacles from approximately 12 inches (30 cm) up to 79 inches (200 cm) from the rear fascia/bumper in the horizontal direction, depending on the location, type and orientation of the obstacle.  The six ParkSense sensors, located in the front fascia/bumper, monitor the area in front of the vehicle that is within the sensors’ field of view.  The sensors can detect obstacles from approximately 12 inches (30 cm) up to 47 inches (120 cm) from the front fascia/bumper in the horizontal direction, depending on the location, type and orientation of the obstacle.
