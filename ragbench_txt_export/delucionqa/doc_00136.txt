Cruise Control can be dangerous where the system cannot maintain a constant speed.  Your vehicle could go too fast for the conditions, and you could lose control and have an accident.  Do not use Cruise Control in heavy traffic or on roads that are winding, icy, snow-covered or slippery.  Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) increases the driving convenience provided by Cruise Control while traveling on highways and major roadways.  However, it is not a safety system and not designed to prevent collisions.  The Cruise Control function performs differently if your vehicle is not equipped with ACC Push the on/off button to activate the Cruise Control.  The cruise indicator light in the instrument cluster display will illuminate.  To turn the system off, push the on/off button a second time.  The cruise indicator light will turn off.  The system should be turned off when not in use.
