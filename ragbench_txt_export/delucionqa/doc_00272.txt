Key Fob Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter ‘n Go™ (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  Note: The key fob’s wireless signal may be blocked if the key fob is located next to a mobile phone, laptop, or other electronic device.  This may result in poor performance.  With the ignition in the ON/RUN position, and the vehicle moving at 2 mph (4 km/h), all RKE commands are disabled.  WARNING: Push the Mechanical Key Release Button only with the key fob facing away from your body, especially your eyes and objects that may be damaged, such as clothing.  CAUTION: The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Note: In case the ignition switch does not change with the push of a button, the key fob may have a low or fully depleted battery.  A low key fob battery condition may be indicated by a message in the instrument cluster display, or by the LED light on the key fob.  If the LED key fob light no longer illuminates from key fob button pushes, then the key fob battery requires replacement.  Improper disposal of key fob batteries may be harmful to the environment.  Please see an authorized dealer for proper battery disposal "⇨general information" .
