Step One Failure to follow the next steps could result in damage to the soft top or vehicle.  Using the side link, lift and push the soft top toward the front of the vehicle, manually guiding the top into the closed position.  Step Two Step Two From inside the vehicle, pull the handle on the header latch downward to engage the hook into its receiver.  Step Three Pull the handle back upward while squeezing the hook, locking the latch into place.  Step Four It is recommended that the top be free of water prior to opening it.  Operating the top, opening a door or lowering a window while the top is wet may allow water to drip into the vehicle's interior.  Careless handling and storage of the soft top may damage the seals, causing water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The soft top must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior.
