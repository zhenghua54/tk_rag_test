Door Latch Alignment If the door does not center align between the latch and the striker, proceed as follows: Loosen (do not remove) the four bolts on the door hinges using the provided #T50 Torx head driver.  Hinge bolt locations with the bolts loose, hold the door in the almost closing position, and check that the latch and striker align.  With the latch and striker aligned, proceed to close the door softly and tighten the hinge bolts to 20.3 ft路 lb / 27.5 N路m (Max Torque: 27.3 ft路 lb / 37 N路m).  CAUTION: Upon first installation of the half-doors, slowly set the door almost to the closing position and check how the door latch aligns with the body striker.  Touch condition between these components can result in damage to both the door and the striker.  Note: Only adjust the door to fit correctly against the striker.  DO NOT adjust the striker, as this could affect the positioning of the full door.
