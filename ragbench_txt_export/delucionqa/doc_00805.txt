Stationary Objects And Vehicles ACC does not react to stationary objects or vehicles.  For example, ACC will not react in situations where the vehicle you are following exits your lane and the vehicle ahead is stopped in your lane.  It will consider this stopped vehicle a stationary object as it did not previously detect movement from it.  Always be attentive and ready to apply the brakes if necessary.
