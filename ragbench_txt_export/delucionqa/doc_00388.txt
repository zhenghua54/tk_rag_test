Outside Mirrors The Outside Mirrors are located on the front driver and passenger side doors, and are adjusted manually or by power adjustment (if equipped).  To receive maximum benefit, adjust the Outside Mirror(s) to center on the adjacent lane of traffic with a slight overlap of the view obtained on the inside mirror.  For information on the Door Off Mirror Kit (if equipped) when the front doors are removed, see WARNING: Vehicles and other objects seen in the passenger side convex mirror will look smaller and farther away than they really are.  Relying too much on your passenger side mirror could cause you to collide with another vehicle or other object.  Use your inside mirror when judging the size or distance of a vehicle seen in the passenger side mirror.  Outside Mirrors With Turn Signal — If Equipped Driver and passenger outside mirrors with turn signal lighting contain LEDs, which are located in the upper outer corner of each mirror.  The LEDs are turn signal indicators, which flash with the corresponding turn signal lights in the front and rear of the vehicle.  Turning on the Hazard Warning flashers will also activate these LEDs.  Automatic Dimming Mirror — If Equipped The rearview mirror can be adjusted up, down, left, and right.  The mirror should be adjusted to center on the view through the rear window.  This mirror automatically adjusts for headlight glare from vehicles behind you.  The Automatic Dimming feature can be turned on or off through the Uconnect Controls button on the touchscreen.  Note: The Automatic Dimming Mirror feature is disabled when the vehicle is in REVERSE to improve the driver’s rear view.  CAUTION: To avoid damage to the mirror during cleaning, never spray any cleaning solution directly onto the mirror.  Apply the solution onto a clean cloth and wipe the mirror clean.
