If the gross trailer weight is 2,000 lb (907 kg) or more, it is recommended to use a weight-distributing hitch to ensure stable handling of your vehicle.  If you use a standard weight-carrying hitch, you could lose control of your vehicle and cause a collision.  A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  When using a fascia/bumper mounted ball on any model, the trailer weight is limited to 3,500 lb (1,588 kg), 30 ft 2 (2.79 m 2 ) frontal area, and 350 lb (159 kg) tongue weight.  The trailer tongue weight must be considered as part of the combined weight of occupants and cargo (ie.  the GVWR), and the GVWR should never exceed the weight referenced on the Tire And Loading Information Placard
