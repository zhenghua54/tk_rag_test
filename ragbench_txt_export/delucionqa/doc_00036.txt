Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  The Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is a part of an Onboard Diagnostic System called OBD II that monitors engine and automatic transmission control systems.  This warning light will illuminate when the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine start.  If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following:
