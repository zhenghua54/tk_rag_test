To open the tailgate, pull the release handle located on the center of the tailgate and guide it to the lowered position.  Secure the tailgate in this position by looping the tailgate straps behind the circular retainer on both sides.  Tailgate In Mid Position If the Tonneau Cover is installed, make sure the Tonneau Cover is fully closed before closing the tailgate.  Due to the presence of the Center High-Mounted Stop Lamp, removal of the tailgate is not recommended.  If the tailgate is lowered, the jack extension with hook can be added to this assembly to enable lowering of the spare tire without having to raise the tailgate.  To use the mid position, open the tailgate and lower it to near mid position.  The vehicleâ€™s tailgate can be set to three positions: open, mid, or closed.  The mid position can be used to provide a loading surface for transporting sheet goods.  After closing, pull back on the tailgate firmly to ensure it is securely latched.  Failure to securely latch the tailgate could result in damage to the vehicle or cargo.  The tailgate is dampened to provide a slower, more controlled lowering.
