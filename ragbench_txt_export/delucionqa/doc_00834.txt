The Uconnect system is a sophisticated electronic device.  Do not let young children use the system.  Permanent hearing loss may occur if you play your music or sound system at loud volumes.  Exercise caution when setting the volume on the system.  Keep drinks, rain and other sources of moisture away from the system.  Besides damage to the system, moisture can cause electric shocks as with any electronic device.  It is possible to have multiple devices connected to the Uconnect system.  For example, if using Android Auto™/Apple CarPlay®, the connected device will be used to place hands-free phone calls or send hands-free text messages.  However, another device can also be paired to the Uconnect system, via Bluetooth®, as an audio source, so the passenger can stream music.  Uconnect Phone is a voice-activated, hands-free, in-vehicle communications system.  It allows you to dial a phone number with your mobile phone.
