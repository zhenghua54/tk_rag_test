Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.
