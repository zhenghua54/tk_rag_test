MANUAL PARK RELEASE — IF EQUIPPED In order to move the vehicle in cases where the transmission will not shift out of Park (P) (such as a depleted battery), a Manual Park Release is available.  See the following steps to use the Manual Park Release: Firmly apply the parking brake.  Using a small screwdriver or similar tool, remove the manual park release cover located in front of the gear selector, to access the release tether strap.  Manual park release cover fish the tether strap up through the opening in the console base.  Tether strap press and maintain firm pressure on the brake pedal.  Pull the tether strap until the release lever locks into place in the vertical position.  The vehicle is now out of PARK (P) and can be moved.  Release the parking brake only when the vehicle is securely connected to a tow vehicle.  Vertical Released Position WARNING: Always secure your vehicle by fully applying the parking brake before activating the Manual Park Release.  In addition, you should be seated in the driver’s seat with your foot firmly on the brake pedal when activating the Manual Park Release.  Activating the Manual Park Release will allow your vehicle to roll away if it is not secured by the parking brake, or by proper connection to a tow vehicle.  Activating the Manual Park Release on an unsecured vehicle could lead to serious injury or death for those in or around the vehicle.
