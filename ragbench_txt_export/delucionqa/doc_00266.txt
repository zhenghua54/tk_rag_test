High/Low Beam Switch The High/Low Beam switch is located within the multifunction lever on the left side of the steering wheel.  High beam headlights can be used for improved visibility in low lit areas when there is no oncoming traffic.  Otherwise, it is recommended to use the low beam headlights to reduce glare to other vehicles.  With the headlight switch activated, push the multifunction lever toward the instrument panel to switch the headlights to high beams.  The lever will return to the centered position.  To return the headlights to low beam, pull the lever toward the steering wheel, or push the lever toward the instrument panel.
