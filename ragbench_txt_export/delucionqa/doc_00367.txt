Manual Mirror â€” If Equipped The rearview mirror can be adjusted up, down, left, and right.  The mirror should be adjusted to center on the view through the rear window.  Headlight glare from vehicles behind you can be reduced by moving the small control under the mirror to the night position (toward the rear of the vehicle).  The mirror should be adjusted while set in the day position (toward the windshield).
