If the door frames are installed from soft top usage, they must be removed prior to installation of the hard top To install the hard top, place the hard top on the vehicle while making sure that the top is sitting flush with the body at the sides and across the back.  Then follow the removal steps in reverse order.  The Torx head fasteners that attach the hard top to the body should be torqued to 155 in-lb +/- 22 in-lb (17.5 N·m +/- 2.5 N·m) using the provided #T50 Torx head driver and ratchet.  Note: Inspect the hard top seals for damage and replace if necessary.  Install the hard top using the same steps for removal in reverse order.  When reinstalling the interior soft trim panel: be sure the panel is centered so that there is an even gap on both sides.  Apply pressure over the hook-and-loop fasteners to ensure they are properly secured.  CAUTION: Do not overtighten Torx fasteners.  Damage to the retainers will occur.  If installing the soft top immediately after removing the hard top, ensure the wire harness is stored properly, and not tucked under the belt rail Provided Tools For your convenience, a tool kit is provided with your vehicle located in the center console.  This kit includes the necessary tools required for the operations described in the following sections.  All pieces fit into the ratchet for easy use.  If your vehicle is equipped with a Dual Top, the soft top system will be provided in a separate box located in the bed of the vehicle for shipping purposes only.  Note: The soft top and the hard top are to be used independently.  Your vehicle warranty will not cover damage resulting from both tops being installed at the same time.
