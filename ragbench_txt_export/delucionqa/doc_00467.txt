Crossing A Ravine, Gully, Ditch, Washout Or Rut When crossing a ravine, gully, ditch, washout or a large rut, the angled approach is the key to maintaining your vehicle's mobility.  Approach these obstacles at a 45-degree angle and let each tire go through the obstacle independently.  You need to use caution when crossing large obstacles with steep sides.  Do not attempt to cross any large obstacle with steep sides at an angle great enough to put the vehicle at risk of a rollover.  If you get caught in a rut, dig a small trench to the right or left at a 45-degree angle ahead of the front tires.  Use the removed dirt to fill the rut ahead of the turnout you just created.  You should now be able to drive out following the trench you just created at a 45-degree angle.  WARNING: There is an increased risk of rollover when crossing an obstacle, at any angle, with steep sides.
