Mark Jacobs is a former foreign service officer. He has published more than 90 stories in a range of magazines, including "The Atlantic," "The Iowa Review", "The Kenyon Review", "The Southern Review", "The Idaho Review", and "Southern Humanities Review". His story "How Birds Communicate" won the Iowa Review Fiction Prize in 1998. His five books include three novels and two collections of short stories. Pulitzer Prize winner in fiction Robert Olen Butler wrote that "Mark Jacobs is one of the most exciting new writers I've read in years... a writer who I think will become our own Graham Greene." While much of his earlier work was set in the countries in which he lived and traveled, more recent material has included novels and short stories that are set in the United States.
