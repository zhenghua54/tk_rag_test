Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe is a 1991 humorous travelogue by American writer Bill Bryson. It documents the author's tour of Europe in 1990, with many flashbacks to two summer tours he made in 1972 and 1973 in his college days. Parts featuring his 1973 tour focus to a large extent on the pseudonymous "Stephen Katz", who accompanied Bryson, and who would play a more prominent role in Bryson's later book "A Walk in the Woods", as well as appearing in "The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid".
