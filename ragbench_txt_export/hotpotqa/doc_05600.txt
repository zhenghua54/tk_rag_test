Shamayim (שָׁמַיִם), the Hebrew word for "heaven" (literally "heavens", plural), denotes one component of the three-part cosmos, the other elements being "erets" (the earth) and "sheol" (the underworld). "Shamayim" is the dwelling place of God and other heavenly beings, "erets" is the home of the living, and "sheol" is the realm of the dead, including, in post-Hebrew Bible literature (including the Christian New Testament), the abode of the righteous dead.
