Amelia Stone Quinton (July 31, 1833 â€“ June 23, 1926) was an American social activist and advocate for Native American rights. In collaboration with Mary Bonney she helped form the Women's National Indian Association in 1883. She was the association's president from 1887 to 1904; during this time the association made progress in advancing the rights of Native Americans, including influencing the passing of the "Dawes Severalty Act" by Congress in 1887, providing Native Americans with allotment and citizenship. Henry Dawes would later recognize that "the new government Indian policy was born of and nursed by this women' association."
