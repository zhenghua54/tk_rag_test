Curaçao Centre for Correction and Detention (Papiamento: "Sentro di Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou", SDKK; Dutch: "Centrum voor Detentie en Correctie Curaçao") is the only prison on the Caribbean island of Curaçao. Since the construction of the prison in 1960 the prison has also been known as the Koraal Specht-prison, after the name of the neighbourhood it is located in. After renovations around the year 2001 the prison changed its name to Bon Futuro prison, meaning good future. At the Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010 the prison changed its name once more and became the Sentro di Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou. During its existence the prison has been noted for ill treatment of prisoners and poor conditions. International, Dutch, Antillean and Curaçaoan investigations have found problems frequently. As of December 2014 the facility holds around 400 prisoners.
