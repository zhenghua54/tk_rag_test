The 2000–01 NBA season was the 31st season for the Portland Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Association. In the offseason, the Blazers acquired Dale Davis from the Indiana Pacers, and All-Star forward Shawn Kemp from the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team trade. At midseason, the team re-signed free agent Rod Strickland, who was released by the Washington Wizards. Falling nine games below the previous season's mark, the Blazers nevertheless made the playoffs for the 19th consecutive year, finishing as the #7 seed in the Western Conference with a 50–32 record. Rasheed Wallace was selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game.
