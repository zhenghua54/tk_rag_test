The Crystal Palace Football Club Player of the Year is awarded at the end of each season. Since the inaugural award was made to John McCormick in 1972, 34 different players have won the award. Nine of these players have won the award for a second time, the most recent being Wilfried Zaha. Two players have received the award on more than two occasions, Jim Cannon won it three times and Julián Speroni won it four times. Paul Hinshelwood was the first to win the trophy in consecutive seasons, a feat since emulated by Andrew Johnson, Julián Speroni and Wilfried Zaha. Speroni is the only one to win it in three consecutive seasons. The current incumbent of the award is Wilfried Zaha, who was the 2016–17 recipient.
