Charles Richards Gordon, known as Dick "Scoop" Gordon (January 15, 1911 – December 8, 2008), was an American sports journalist whose works were a regular feature in venerable sports magazines like "The Sporting News", "Sports Illustrated", and "Baseball Digest". After earning his nickname "Scoop" in 1930 by reporting for "The Daily Princetonian" that golfing legend Bobby Jones would be retiring from active competition, Gordon went on to a sports reporting career which ended in 2008.
