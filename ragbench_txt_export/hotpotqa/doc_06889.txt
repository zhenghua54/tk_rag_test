The Best of Black Sabbath is a double CD compilation album by Black Sabbath released in 2000 on the Sanctuary Records label. Its 32 songs are presented chronologically from the band's first 11 albums, spanning the years 1970 to 1983. Black Sabbath's classic six-album run, from 1970s debut "Black Sabbath" through 1975's "Sabotage" is celebrated with three to six songs from each album. Original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne's subsequent final two albums with the band, 1976's "Technical Ecstasy" and 1978's "Never Say Die!", are represented by one and two songs, respectively. Replacement Ronnie James Dio's early 80's stint fronting the band on two albums is acknowledged with the title track of 1980's "Heaven and Hell" and a track from 1981's "The Mob Rules". The compilation closes with a song from 1983's attempted rebirth, "Born Again", former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan's sole album with the band. "The Best of Black Sabbath" does not include any later material with vocalists Glenn Hughes (1986's "Seventh Star"), Tony Martin (1986â€“96) or the returning Dio (1992's "Dehumanizer").
