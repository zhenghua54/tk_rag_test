Once Just is a three piece rock band with reggae, hip hop and punk influences, from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. They were signed to an offshoot of Sudden Death Records from 2006 to 2009. They requested a release from their label due to inadequate funding. They are the only Canadian act to have played with Canada's Godfather of Punk (Joey "Shithead" Keithley) and Canada's Godfather of HipHop (MC Maestro Fresh Wes) Their album destination was produced by punk rock legend Joey "shithead" Keithley.
