The Camp Pedricktown Air Defense Base was a Cold War Missile Master installation with an Army Air Defense Command Post, and associated search, height finder, and identification friend or foe radars. The station's radars were subsequently replaced with radars at Gibbsboro Air Force Station 15 miles away. The obsolete Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System,a 1957-vintage vacuum tube computer, was removed after command of the defense area was transferred to the command post at Highlands Air Force Station near New York City. The Highlands AFS command post controlled the combined New York-Philadelphia Defense Area.
