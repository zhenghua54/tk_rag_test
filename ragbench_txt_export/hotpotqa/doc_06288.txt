Émile Brugsch (February 24, 1842 in Berlin, Germany – January 14, 1930 in Nice, France) was a German-born Egyptologist whose career spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is known as the official who "evacuated" the mummies from the Deir el-Bahri Cache in 1881, and as being assistant curator of the Bulaq Museum - the core element of what is today's Egyptian Museum. He was the brother of the Egyptologist Heinrich Karl Brugsch.
