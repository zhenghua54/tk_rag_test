Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American adult animated comedy-drama film written and directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a metaphor for inner-city life. "Heavy Traffic" was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz's follow-up to the film "Fritz the Cat". Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, "Heavy Traffic" was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical success.
