The Swedish–Albanian Association (Swedish: "Svensk-albanska föreningen") was a Swedish friendship association, founded during the Cold War to support the People's Socialist Republic of Albania and the Party of Labour of Albania, and to build Swedish-Albanian cultural relations. The group, among other activities, translated and published the works of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha - among them "Imperialismen och revolutionen" (1979) on the subject of the Sino-Albanian split - as well as books on Albanian culture, tourist guide books, and a novella by the author Dhimitër Shuteriqi. The "Swedish-Albanian Association's Bulletin" and "Albania and Us" were two regular publications.
