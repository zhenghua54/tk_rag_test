The Teen Idles were an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C. in September 1979. Consisting of teenagers Nathan Strejcek, Geordie Grindle, Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, the Idles recorded two demo sessions and the 1980 "Minor Disturbance" EP before breaking up in November 1980. The influential independent record label Dischord Records was originally created with the sole purpose of releasing the Teen Idles "Minor Disturbance" 7" record. They were an early landmark in the D.C. hardcore movement, and MacKaye and Nelson would later form the seminal punk rock outfit Minor Threat.
