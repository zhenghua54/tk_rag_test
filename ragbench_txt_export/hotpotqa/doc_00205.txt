"Pox" is a liquor commonly used for ceremonial purposes among the Mayans of Mexico and Central America. "Pox" is a liquor made of corn, sugar cane and wheat, very important in mayan culture for its ceremonial uses and is also known as aguardiente. Besides its religious significance it is also a somewhat popular alcoholic drink in the Chiapas region of Southern Mexico. The word "pox" in Tzotzil means "medicine, cane liquor, cure." Pox was commonly used in religious ceremonies and festivals in San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, but increasingly soda has been substituted for it.
