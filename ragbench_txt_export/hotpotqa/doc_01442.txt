Howard William Thomas Hobbs (born 22 January 1950) is an Australian politician who represented the seat of Warrego in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1 November 1986 until his retirement at the 31 January 2015 state election. He was a member of the National Party of Australia until the Queensland division merged with the Liberal party to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland. Hobbs was Shadow Minister for Local Government and Planning and for Communities from 28 September 2005 until the LNP entered government following the 2012 election. As the longest-serving member of the Legislative Assembly, he presides at the election of Speakers. When he did so in 2009, Dean Wells equaled him in seniority, but Hobbs had taken the oath first because his name comes first alphabetically, so he took the chair as Presiding Member. As Wells lost his seat at the 2012 election, Hobbs alone was the longest-serving member until his retirement at the 2015 state election.
