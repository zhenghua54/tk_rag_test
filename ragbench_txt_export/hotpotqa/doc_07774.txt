East End is an administrative subdistrict of the island of Saint Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. The largest community here is Red Hook, while smaller communities include Benner, Nazareth, Nadir, Frydendal, and Smith Bay. Some of the offshore islands here include Great Saint James Island, Little Saint James Island, Bovoni Cay, Patricia Cay, Cas Cay, Rotto Cay, Thatch Cay, Shark Island, and Dog Island. The East End subdistrict received 731 new residents between the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2010 U.S. Census, and has a 2010 population of 6,658. The East End region offers a more secluded character and less population density than subdistricts as Charlotte Amalie, Southside, and the Tutu subdistricts. This subdistrict is home to numerous of the islandsâ€™ largest resorts, in addition to many shopping areas and entertainment venues, as well as the Coral World Marine Park & Underwater Observatory in Coki Point, which is the most popular tourist attraction on Saint Thomas. East End is located about 7.4 miles east of the territorial capital of Charlotte Amalie, which is an approximately thirty-minute drive on the windy, small and narrow Saint Thomas roads. There are buses and taxis leaving from the East End. A typical fare for a taxi drive to the capital costs $20. The hotels on Saint Thomas are evenly divided between the two subdistricts of Charlotte Amalie, and the more expensive resort-style hotels by their own beachside in East End. The East End resorts are therefore generally more expensive than those found elsewhere on the island. Some of the famous beaches found here are Lindquist- and Sapphire Beaches, while others include Pineapple Beach (Renaissance Beach) and Vessup Beach amongst others.
