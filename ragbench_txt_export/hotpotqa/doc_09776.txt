Starplex Pavilion (originally Coca-Cola Starplex Amphitheatre) is an outdoor amphitheatre located in Fair Park, Dallas, Texas. The venue opened in 1988 as the Coca-Cola Starplex Amphitheatre, with 7,500 seats, under a pavilion and 12,500 general admission lawn seats. After Coca-Cola's naming rights expired in 1998, the venue was known simply as Starplex Amphitheatre. In 2000, naming rights were sold to the Smirnoff vodka company, as a result of a corporate sponsorship agreement with The House of Blues. The center was then called Smirnoff Music Centre. The name changed again in January 2008 when naming rights were awarded to Superpages.com Center. It was renamed in 2011 to Gexa Energy Pavilion. In January 2017, the name changed again to Starplex Pavilion.
