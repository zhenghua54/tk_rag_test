Friedrich Jeckeln (2 February 1895 â€“ 3 February 1946) was a high-ranking official in the SS of Nazi Germany who served as an SS and Police Leader in the occupied Soviet Union during World War II. Jeckeln was the commander of one of the largest collection of "Einsatzgruppen" and was personally responsible for ordering and organizing the deaths of over 100,000 Jews, Slavs, Romani, and other "undesirables". After the end of World War II, Jeckeln was convicted for his crimes by a Soviet military tribunal in Riga, Latvia and executed in 1946.
