Connect 4x4 (spoken as Connect Four by Four) is a three-dimensional-thinking strategy game first released in 2009 by Milton Bradley. The goal of the game is identical to that of its similarly named predecessor, Connect Four. Players take turns placing game pieces in the grid-like, vertically suspended playing field until one player has four of his or her color lined up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Unlike its predecessor, Connect 4x4 uses a double grid, two different types of game pieces, and can be played by up to four people at once.
