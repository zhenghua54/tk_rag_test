The Andes or Andean Mountains (Spanish: "Cordillera de los Andes" ) are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They form a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. This range is about 7000 km long, about 200 to wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about 4000 m . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.
