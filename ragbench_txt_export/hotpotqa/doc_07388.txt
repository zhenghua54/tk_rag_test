A higher diploma is an academic award in Iraq, Libya, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Ireland and Oman. In Iraq and Libya, it's one year after bachelor's degree (i.e., NOT equivalent to a bachelor's degree, as many people claim). In Ireland it is a postgraduate qualification at the same level of the honours bachelor's degree. In the United Kingdom, the diploma is equivalent to higher tier (A*-C) GCSE.
