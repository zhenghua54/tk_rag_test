Marathon (Demotic Greek: Μαραθώνας, "Marathónas"; Attic/Katharevousa: Μαραθών , "Marathṓn") is a town in Greece, the site of the battle of Marathon in 490 BC, in which the heavily outnumbered Athenian army defeated the Persians. The tumulus or burial mound (Greek" Τύμβος, tymbos", tomb) of the 192 Athenian dead, also called the "Soros", which was erected near the battlefield, remains a feature of the coastal plain. The Tymbos is now marked by a marble memorial stele and surrounded by a small park.
