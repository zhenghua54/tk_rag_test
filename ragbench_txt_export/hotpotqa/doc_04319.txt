The Las Vegas metropolitan area is home to many sports, most of which take place in the unincorporated communities around Las Vegas rather than in the city itself. The Las Vegas Valley has one major league professional team: the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL) who began play in 2017 as the region's first major pro team. The Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) will begin play in Las Vegas as the "Las Vegas Raiders" by 2020 and become the region's second major professional team. Las Vegas is also home to one minor league sports team: the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (Minor League Baseball). The 51s are currently the only team to actually play in the city of Las Vegas, playing at the city owned Cashman Field. They will be joined in 2018 by the Las Vegas Lights FC of the United Soccer League, one of two leagues that collectively make up the second level of the U.S. men's soccer league system.
