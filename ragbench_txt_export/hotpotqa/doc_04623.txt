Hibernian Football Club ( ), commonly known as Hibs, are a Scottish professional football club based in Leith in the north of Edinburgh. Hibs play in the Scottish Premiership, the first tier of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), having been promoted by winning the Scottish Championship in 2017. It is one of three SPFL clubs in the city, the others being their Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts and Edinburgh City. Hibernian was founded in 1875 by Irish immigrants, but support for the club is now based on geography rather than ethnicity or religion. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge.
