For the first time in the history of Rutgers football, the team entered a season ranked—they were 16th in both the Associated Press and Coaches polls. The Scarlet Knights finished the season with an 8–5 record that included a 52–30 victory over the Ball State Cardinals in the 2008 International Bowl. It marked the third consecutive appearance of the team in a post-season bowl game, and the second bowl game won by the team.
