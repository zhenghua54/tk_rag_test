Randall Craig "Tex" Cobb (born December 10, 1953) is an American former professional boxer who competed in the heavyweight division. Widely considered to possess one of the greatest chins of all time, Cobb was a brawler who also packed considerable punching power. He began his fighting career in full contact kickboxing in 1975 before making the jump to professional boxing two years later. He challenged Larry Holmes for the WBC heavyweight title in November 1982, losing a one-sided unanimous decision, and took wins over notable heavyweights of his era such as Bernardo Mercado, Earnie Shavers, and Leon Spinks.
