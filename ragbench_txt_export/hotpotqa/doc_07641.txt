In 2001, Associazione Sportiva Roma took its third league title (after 1942 and 1983), winning Serie A only a year after rivals Lazio. Important signings were the Argentines Walter Samuel, a defender, and Gabriel Batistuta, a top striker. Fabio Capello's line-up also included Cafu, Vincent Candela, Emerson, Vincenzo Montella and captain Francesco Totti.
