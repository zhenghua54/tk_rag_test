The New Maverick is a 1978 made-for-TV movie based on the 1957 television series "Maverick", with James Garner as Bret Maverick, Charles Frank as newcomer cousin Ben Maverick (son of Beau Maverick), Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, and Susan Sullivan as Poker Alice Ivers. Garner had been 29 years old at the beginning of the original series and was 50 while filming "The New Maverick". The TV-movie was a pilot for the series "Young Maverick", which featured Frank and only lasted a few episodes. Directed by Hy Averback and written by Juanita Bartlett, the movie was filmed while Garner's series "The Rockford Files" was on hiatus. Garner would later star in "Bret Maverick", another attempt at a television series revival inspired by this TV-movie, for the 1981-82 season.
