The Texas Longhorns are the athletic teams that represent The University of Texas at Austin. The teams are sometimes referred to as the 'Horns and take their name from the Longhorn cattle that were an important part of the development of Texas, and are now the official "large animal" of the U.S. state of Texas. The women's teams are sometimes called the Lady Longhorns, but generally both the men's and women's teams are referred to as the Longhorns, and the mascot is a Texas Longhorn steer named Bevo.
