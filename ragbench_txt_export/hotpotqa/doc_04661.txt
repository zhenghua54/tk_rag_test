The 2016–17 Golden State Warriors season was the 71st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and its 55th in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Warriors won their fifth NBA Championship, setting the best postseason record in NBA history by going 16–1 . They entered the season as runners-up in the 2016 NBA Finals, after a record breaking regular-season in 2015–16. With the acquisition of free agent Kevin Durant in the offseason, the Warriors were hailed as a "Superteam" by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star "Fantastic Four" of Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The Warriors broke over 20 NBA records on their way to equaling their 2014–15 regular-season record of 67–15 , their second most wins in franchise history.
