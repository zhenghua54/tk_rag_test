Scribner's Magazine was an American periodical published by the publishing house of Charles Scribner's Sons from January 1887 to May 1939. "Scribner's Magazine" was the second magazine out of the Scribner's firm, after the publication of "Scribner's Monthly". Charles Scribner's Sons spent over $500,000 setting up the magazine, to compete with the already successful "Harper's Monthly" and "The Atlantic Monthly". "Scribner's Magazine" was launched in 1887, and was the first of any magazine to introduce color illustrations. The magazine ceased publication in 1939.
