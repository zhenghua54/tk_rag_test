Daniel Gonzalez (1980 â€“ 9 August 2007), also known as the Freddy Krueger Killer and the Mummy's Boy Killer, was a spree killer who killed four people and injured two others during two days across London and Sussex in September 2004. His mother had previously written a letter to her MP criticising the fact that a serious incident had to occur before he could receive mental help. In her letter, she rhetorically asked "...does my son have to commit murder to get help?".
