Edmond Andrew Harjo (November 24, 1917 â€“ March 31, 2014) was an American Seminole Code Talker during World War II. Harjo, who served with his brothers at the Normandy landings and the Battle of Iwo Jima, was the last surviving code talker from the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. On November 20, 2013, a group representing thirty-three Native American tribes were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States Congress, for their service as code talkers. Harjo was the only surviving code talker present. He was presented with a silver duplicate of the gold medal representing his tribe.
