Pokémon Live! was a musical stage show that toured the United States on September 22, 2000 to January 19, 2001. Plans for some 2002 performances in the United Kingdom were also made, but later canceled. Despite that, "Pokémon Live!" was invited to perform in Dubai, U.A.E. at Al Mamzar Park in the duration of March 2001, coinciding with the annual Dubai Shopping Festival. The musical was based on the "Pokémon" anime series, using similar characters, clothing, and story elements. Approximately 90 minutes in length, it told the story of Ash Ketchum, Misty and Brock as they travel to a contest to win the much sought-after Diamond Badge. The event turns out to be part of a plan by the evil organization Team Rocket and its diabolic leader Giovanni to take over the world. The music of the show consisted of songs previously released on the "Pokémon" anime soundtracks "Pokémon 2BA Master" and "Totally Pokémon", as well as new songs.
