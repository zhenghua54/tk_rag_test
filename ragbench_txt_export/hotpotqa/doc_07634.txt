Kenneth Jerome Riley (born August 6, 1947) is a former professional American football defensive back who played his entire career for the Cincinnati Bengals, in the American Football League in 1969 and in the NFL from 1970 through 1983. Riley recorded 65 interceptions in his career, which was the fourth most in Pro Football history at the time of his retirement behind three members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Dick Lane, Emlen Tunnell and Paul Krause. But despite his accomplishments, Riley was never an exceptionally popular or well known player. In his 15 seasons, Riley was never once selected to play in the AFL All-Star Game or the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl, and to this date has not been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
