"American Horror Story" (often abbreviated "AHS") is an American anthology horror television series created and produced by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk which premiered on October 5, 2011 on FX. Described as an anthology series, each season is conceived as a mostly self-contained miniseries, following a disparate set of characters and settings, and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end."
