A lovebird is one of nine species of the genus "Agapornis" (Greek: αγάπη "agape" 'love'; όρνις "ornis" 'bird'). They are a social and affectionate small parrot. Eight species are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to Madagascar. Their name comes from the parrots' strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together.
