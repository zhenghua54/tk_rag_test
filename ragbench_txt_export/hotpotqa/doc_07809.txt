The Bill Steers Men's 4-Miler (formerly Charlottesville Men's Four Miler) is the only all men's run in the Charlottesville area. The race was rededicated as a tribute to William D. Steers in 2015. It is an annual event hosted by the Department of Urology at the University of Virginia, and the Charlottesville Track Club. The event has also been sponsored by Panera Bread, BMW of Charlottesville, Starbucks, Pepsi and the City of Charlottesville. The City of Charlottesville also hosts the Women's Four Miler to benefit the UVA Cancer Center Breast Care Program. The event, held continuously since 2004, was conceived by William D. Steers with the purpose of raising awareness on men's health issues; to encourage men to take control of their health, and become more physically active.
