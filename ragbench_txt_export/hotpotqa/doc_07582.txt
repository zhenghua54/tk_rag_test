Thomas Gordon (c. 1691â€“1750) was a Scottish writer and Commonwealthman. Along with John Trenchard, he published "The Independent Whig", which was a weekly periodical. From 1720 to 1723, Trenchard and Gordon wrote a series of 144 essays entitled "Cato's Letters", condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny. The essays were published as "Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious", at first in the "London Journal" and then in the "British Journal". These essays became a cornerstone of the Commonwealth man tradition and were influential in shaping the ideas of the Country Party. His ideas played an important role in shaping republicanism in Britain and especially in the American colonies leading up to the American revolution. Zuckert argues, "The writers who, more than any others, put together the new synthesis that is the new republicanism were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, writing in the early eighteenth century as "Cato."
