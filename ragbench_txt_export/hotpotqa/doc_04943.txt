Mycologia is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes papers on all aspects of the fungi, including lichens. It first appeared as a bimonthly journal in January 1909, published by the New York Botanical Garden under the editorship of William Murrill. It became the official journal of the Mycological Society of America, which still publishes it today. It was formed as a merger of the "Journal of Mycology" (14 volumes; 1885â€“1908) and the "Mycological Bulletin" (7 volumes; 1903-1908). The "Mycological Bulletin" was known as the "Ohio Mycological Bulletin" in its first volume.
