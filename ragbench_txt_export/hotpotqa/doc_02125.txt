The Warrior Ethos is a 2011 non-fiction book by American author Steven Pressfield. It is a unique-style narrative in which Pressfield contemplates the nature of the warrior code and the rules by which a warrior, even a metaphorical one, must follow. He relates several examples from history from the stand of the Spartans at Thermopylae to the defeat of the inner vices as described in the Bhagavad Gita.
