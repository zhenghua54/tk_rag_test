Jawbreaker is a 1999 American black comedy film written and directed by Darren Stein. The film stars Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, and Julie Benz as girls in an exclusive clique in their high school. Charlotte Ayanna has a non-speaking cameo role as the murdered leader of the group. The film was inspired by the film "Heathers", and is often compared to it, particularly the plot involving a popular female clique, and the ostensibly accidental killing of one of its members.
