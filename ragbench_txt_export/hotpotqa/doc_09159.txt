Thomas Mann Prize ("German": Thomas-Mann-Preis) is a literary prize of Germany. In full the title is "Thomas Mann Prize of the city of Lübeck and the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts". It is given in alternate years in Lübeck and in Munich. The award is the product of a merger of two prizes in 2010, the Thomas Mann Preis der Hansestadt Lübeck (Thomas Mann Prize Lübeck) and the Großen Literaturpreis (Great Literature Prize) of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. The Thomas Mann Prize Lübeck was first awarded in 1975; the Great Literature Prize was first awarded in 1950.
