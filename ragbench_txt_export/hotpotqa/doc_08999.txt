Haicke Petrus Marinus Janssen was born in 1885 in Kampen, Netherlands. He was a bookkeeper in Amsterdam before he became a sailor. In 1913, he was working on the Belgian Red Star Line’s SS "Kroonland" as a lookout man when she came to the rescue of the Uranium Steamship Company’s SS "Volturno" after that ship caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean. The United States and United Kingdom awarded him and other seamen involved a medal for rescuing the "Volturno"’s passengers and crew.
