Citizens' Greener Evanston (previously known as "Citizens for a Greener Evanston") is an environmental organization in Evanston, Illinois that works primarily on strategies for reducing carbon emissions and increasing community sustainability. Its origins were in Network for Evanston's Future, an umbrella group started c. 2000 for a half-dozen organizations in Evanston working on various aspects of sustainability in the municipality, to wit, Evanston's Affordable Housing Future; The Citizens' Lighthouse Community Land Trust; Evanston's Transportation Future; Evanston Interreligious Sustainability Circle; Evanston's Energy Future; Evanston Food Policy Council; and The Talking Farm. After the City in October 2006 voted to sign the United States Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, Network leaders, after public meetings, convened a number of citizen taskforces, which began working in the fall of 2007 to develop a plan to reduce the city's carbon footprint. The result was the Evanston Climate Action Plan ("ECAP"), passed in November 2008, which proposed over 200 different tactics to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Evanston with respect to transportation, buildings, energy sources, waste, and food production. The Evanston effort was singled out by the State of Illinois as a "best practices" model for developing such a plan. The ECAP was presented to the Evanston City Council, and "accepted" by it, in November, 2008.
