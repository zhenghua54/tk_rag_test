American singer Lady Gaga has released three video albums and has been featured in twenty-eight music videos. From her debut album "The Fame" (2008), she released music videos for the singles "Just Dance", "Poker Face", "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi". In the latter, she portrays a doomed starlet taking revenge on her lover. She reissued her first album as "The Fame Monster" (2009), preceded by a music video for the lead single "Bad Romance", which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video and seven MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year in 2010. The following year, Jonas Åkerlund directed the music video for "Telephone"—a continuation of "Paparazzi"—which was shot as a short film. The video received an MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year nomination, and was named the Best Music Video of the Decade by "Billboard" in January 2015. For her 2010 video "Alejandro", Gaga received positive review from critics, though she was criticized by the Catholic League that alleged blasphemy.
