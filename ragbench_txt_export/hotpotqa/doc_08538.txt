The oldest national anthem, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism", is the Dutch national anthem "Het Wilhelmus", which was written between 1568 and 1572, but not then given any official status. The first anthem to be officially proclaimed as such was "God Save The Queen", adopted by Great Britain in 1745. "Het Wilhelmus" was declared the national anthem of the Netherlands in 1932; both of these anthems remain in use today. A royal or imperial anthem is a song that is similar in patriotic character to a national anthem, but which specifically praises a monarch, or royal dynasty. Some states have doubled their royal or imperial anthem as their national anthem.
