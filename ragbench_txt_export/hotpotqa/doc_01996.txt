A referendum on the new Constitution of France was held in Moyen-Congo on 28 September 1958 as part of a wider referendum held across the French Union. The new constitution would make the territory an autonomous republic within the French Community, and was approved by 99% of voters. The Territorial Assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Congo on 28 November 1958, and the country became independent two years later.
