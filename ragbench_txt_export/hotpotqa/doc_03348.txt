The Continental Baths was a gay bathhouse in the basement of The Ansonia Hotel in New York City which was opened in 1968 by Steve Ostrow. It was advertised as reminiscent of "the glory of ancient Rome". The documentary film "Continental", by Malcolm Ingram, covers the height of the club's popularity through the early 1970s.
