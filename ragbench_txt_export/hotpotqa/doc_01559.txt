Arthur Lubin (July 25, 1898 â€“ May 12, 1995) was an American film director and producer who directed several "Abbott & Costello" films, "Phantom of the Opera" (1943), the "Francis the Talking Mule" series and created the talking-horse TV series "Mister Ed". A prominent director for Universal Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, he is perhaps best known today as the man who gave Clint Eastwood his first contract in film.
