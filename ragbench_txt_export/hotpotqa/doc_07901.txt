A sacral nerve stimulator is a small device implanted in the buttocks of people who have problems with bladder and/or bowel control. This device is implanted in the buttock and connected to the sacral nerve by a wire. The device stops urges to defecate and urinate by sending signals to the sacral nerve. The patient is able to control their bladder and/or bowel via an external device similar to a remote control.
