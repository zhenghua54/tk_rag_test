The discography of Anggun consists of ten studio albums, two soundtrack albums, three greatest hits albums, seven single compilations, thirty-eight singles and twenty music videos. Anggun began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. Her debut studio album, "Dunia Aku Punya", was released in 1986 under Billboard Indonesia, but did not achieve commercial success. Anggun's popularity was later established after the success of the single "Mimpi", which was listed as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time. With the release of subsequent singles and three more studio albums— "Anak Putih Abu Abu", "Nocturno" and "Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!!"—Anggun became one of the most successful Indonesian rock singers in the early 1990s. In 1993, she became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records. By the age of nineteen, Anggun had sold over four million albums in Indonesia.
