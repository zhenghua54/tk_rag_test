Jewish ghettos in Europe were parts of a number of cities in Europe in which Jews were permitted to live. In addition to being confined to ghettos, Jews were placed under strict regulations and disabilities in many European cities. The character of ghettos varied over times. In some cases, they comprised a Jewish quarter, the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews. In many instances, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos had narrow streets and small, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system. Around the ghetto stood walls that, during pogroms, were closed from inside to protect the community, but from the outside during Christmas, Pesach, and Easter Week to prevent the Jews from leaving at those times.
