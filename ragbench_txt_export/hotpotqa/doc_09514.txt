Svalbard and Jan Mayen (Norwegian: "Svalbard og Jan Mayen" , ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: SJ, ISO 3166-1 alpha-3: SJM, ISO 3166-1 numeric: 744) is a statistical designation defined by ISO 3166-1 of two parts of Norway under separate jurisdictionsâ€”Svalbard and Jan Mayen. While the two are combined for the purposes of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) category, they are not administratively related. This has further resulted in the country code top-level domain .sj being issued for Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and . The United Nations Statistics Division also uses this code, but has named it Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.
