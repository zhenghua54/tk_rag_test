The 1965 World Series featured the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the American League champion Minnesota Twins. It is best remembered for the heroics of Sandy Koufax, who was named the series MVP. Koufax would not pitch in Game 1, as it fell on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, but did pitch in Game 2 and then tossed complete-game shutouts in Games 5 and 7 (with only two days of rest in between) to win the championship.
