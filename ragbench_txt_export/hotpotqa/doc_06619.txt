Minhaeng Cho (born 26 February 1965) is a South Korean scientist in researching physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and microscopy. He joined the faculty of the Department of Chemistry, College of Science, in Korea University (http://www.korea.ac.kr/) in 1996. His research group actively studies nonlinear optical and vibrational spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations of chemical and biological systems in condensed phases, quantum dynamics of chemical reactions, linear and nonlinear chiroptical spectroscopy of biomolecules, quantum spectroscopy and imaging with high-precision laser technology, interferometric measurements of scattering fields for single particle tracking, chemically sensitive spectroscopy and imaging, surface-specific spectroscopy, and ultrafast vibrational microspectroscopy. He directed the National Creative Research Initiative Center for Coherent Multidimensional Spectroscopy (2000â€“2009). In December 2014, he was appointed as the Director of the IBS (Institute for Basic Science) Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, located in Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.
