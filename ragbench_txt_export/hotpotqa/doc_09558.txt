Upstate New York, broadly defined as a region of the U.S. state of New York north of New York City and Westchester County, is home to several skyscrapers and high-rises. The tallest building in New York State is the 104-story One World Trade Center, which was completed in 2014 and rises to 1776 ft in Lower Manhattan, New York City. New York City, the largest city in the United States, is home to the vast majority of the skyscrapers in New York; outside the city, most of the state's skyscrapers are concentrated in Albany, Buffalo and Rochester. The tallest building in Upstate New York is the 44-story Erastus Corning Tower, which rises 589 ft in Albany, the state's capital city. Although the building is the tallest in the upstate region by a significant margin, it does not appear in the 100-tallest buildings in New York state when New York City skyscrapers are included in the ranking. The second-tallest building in the upstate region is the 529 ft One HSBC Center, which also stands as the tallest building in the city of Buffalo.
