The personal standard of Adolf Hitler was designed after Reichspr채sident Paul von Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934. Adolf Hitler abolished the title "Reichspr채sident" and in its place instituted the title of "F체hrer" which henceforth could only be used when referring to him personally. Hindenburg used a personal standard consisting of a black eagle on a square gold background edged by a border of black, white and red bands. Hitler decided on 19 August 1934 to adopt a personal standard for himself, which was called "Personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Chancellor of the German Nation". As he was also Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces it was somewhat later known as "The personal standard for Adolf Hitler as Leader and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces" (German: "Standarte des F체hrers und Obersten Befehlshabers der Wehrmacht").
