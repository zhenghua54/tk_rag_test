The 2000–01 NBA season was the Timberwolves' 12th season in the National Basketball Association. After the death of Malik Sealy, the Timberwolves scrambled to find a replacement for him, signing free agent Chauncey Billups, a close friend of Kevin Garnett while signing LaPhonso Ellis. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves secret free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled their proper procedure in signing the contract, while stripping their first round draft picks for the next five seasons and fined $3.5 million. Smith would sign with the Detroit Pistons, and the Timberwolves' owner Glen Taylor, and vice president Kevin McHale were both suspended for one year. Despite the troubles, the Timberwolves posted an 11-game winning streak midway through the season, and finished fourth in the Midwest Division with a 47–35 record, with Garnett being selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game.
