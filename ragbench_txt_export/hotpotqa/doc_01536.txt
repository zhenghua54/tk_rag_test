Batman: Original Motion Picture Score is the score album for the 1989 film "Batman" by Danny Elfman. According to the "Batman" DVD Special Edition, Elfman said that producer Jon Peters was not sure about him as a composer until Tim Burton made him play the main titles. Elfman admitted he was stunned when Peters announced that the score would be released on its own album, as releasing a separate score album for a film was something that was rarely done in the 1980s. Elfman's "The Batman Theme" went on to become an iconic piece. It served as the basis for the theme music of "", which premiered in 1992, although this was later changed. Some parts of the Elfman score are also heard in "", "" and "". Parts are also played in the queue, and on the station platform of Batman the Ride at various Six Flags theme parks.
