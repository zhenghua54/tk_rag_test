Aladdin is an upcoming American musical romantic fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie from a screenplay written by John August, Ritchie and Vanessa Taylor, and co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Lin Pictures, and Marc Platt Productions. It is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film of the same name, which is in turn based on the Arab-style folktale of the same name from "One Thousand and One Nights" and the French interpretation by Antoine Galland. The film stars Mena Massoud as the titular character with Naomi Scott, Will Smith, Marwan Kenzari, Navid Negahban, Nasim Pedrad, Billy Magnussen, and Numan Acar in supporting roles. It is scheduled to be released on May 24, 2019 in the United States.
