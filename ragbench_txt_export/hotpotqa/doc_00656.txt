The Smurfs (French: "Les Schtroumpfs" ) is a Belgian comic series, created by cartoonist Peyo (pen name of Pierre Culliford). The titular creatures were introduced as supporting characters in an already established series, "Johan and Peewit" in 1958, and starred in their own series from 1959. Thirty "Smurf" comic albums have been created, 16 of them by Peyo. Originally, the "Smurf" stories appeared in "Spirou" magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher Dupuis, many comics were first published in dedicated "Smurf" magazines, which existed in French, Dutch and German. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected in comic books next to the regular series of 30. By 2008, "Smurf" comics have been translated into 25 languages, and some 25 million albums have been sold. A new Smurfs comic album sold in 2009 in French alone some 140,000 copies. A new "Smurfs" comic album was released in 2012, now making thirty total titles. Another one was issued in 2013, now making thirty-one total titles.
