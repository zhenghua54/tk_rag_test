The Grand Shaftesbury Run, previously known as the Great Shaftesbury Run, is an off-road, rural half marathon and 10k course that takes place on the 2,200 ha historic Shaftesbury Estate in Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, England. Both courses start and finish in the park at St Giles House, the historic home of the Earls of Shaftesbury. The inaugural event, held on 12 June 2011, opened the family estate to the public for the first time in 60 years.
