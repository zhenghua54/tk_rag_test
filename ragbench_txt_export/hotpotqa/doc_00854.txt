I Was Born, But... (Japanese: 大人の見る絵本　生れてはみたけれど "Otona no miru ehon - Umarete wa mita keredo" "An Adult's Picture Book View — I Was Born, But...") is a 1932 black-and-white Japanese silent film directed by Yasujirō Ozu. It became the first of six Ozu films to win the Kinema Junpō Critics' Prize. Ozu later loosely remade the film as "Good Morning" (1959).
