The 2015 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise’s 56th overall season as a football team, 46th in the National Football League, third under leadership of general manager Doug Whaley and first under new head coach Rex Ryan, who signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract on January 12, 2015 after having previously spent the past six seasons coaching the division-rival New York Jets, leading them to two straight AFC Championship games in 2009 and 2010, becoming the franchise’s 18th head coach and the fifth in the past seven years in the process. Ryan replaced Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract on December 31, 2014 to take advantage of a contract loophole, fearing the Pegulas were going to fire him, hence the reason the Bills entered the 2015 season looking for a new head coach. Despite the bold prediction made by Ryan at his introductory press conference, where he stated, “I’m not going to let our fans down. I am not going to do that. I know it’s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs. Well, get ready, man, we’re going. We are going,” the Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team’s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015. It was also the first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (whom also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson in March at the age of 95. The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.
