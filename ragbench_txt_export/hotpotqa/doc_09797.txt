The American Russell Terrier Club (formerly named the English Jack Russell Terrier Club), founded by JoAnn Stoll in 1995, was the first registry in the United States to maintain the Russell Terrier as a separate breed from the Parson Russell Terrier. The American Jack Russell Terrier Club is affiliated with both the United Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club. The purpose of the early founders was to establish a registry for the perpetuation and development of the Russell Terrier as a pure strain of working Jack Russell Terrier keeping their blood and type pure within the registry to works towards Kennel Club recognition as an official breed in the US. On January 1, 2001, the United Kennel Club recognized the Russell Terrier as an official breed, designating only the stock from the American Russell Terrier Club as Foundation stock for the UKC Russell Terrier. In 2004 the American Russell Terrier Club submitted an official request to include the American Russell Terrier Club stock into the AKC FSS Program to work towards becoming an official breed under the perimeters. On December 8, 2004, the AKC officially accepted the Russell Terrier.
