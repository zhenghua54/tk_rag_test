"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase" is the twenty-fourth episode of the eighth season of "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 11, 1997. The episode centers on fictional pilot episodes of non-existent television series derived from "The Simpsons", and is a parody of the tendency of networks to spin off characters from a hit series. As such it includes references to many different TV series. The first fictional spin-off is "Chief Wiggum P.I.", a cop-drama featuring Chief Wiggum and Seymour Skinner. The second is "The Love-matic Grampa", a sitcom featuring Moe Szyslak who receives dating advice from Abraham Simpson, whose ghost is possessing a love testing machine. The final segment is "The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour", a variety show featuring the Simpson family except for Lisa, who has been replaced.
