Parker was born in 1714 in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. When he was eleven-years-old, his father died. Parker apprenticed himself on a servant indenture on January 1, 1727 for eight years to William Bradford, the colonial printer in New York City. The agreement terms were that Bradford was to feed and provide for Parker in exchange for labor the boy would do. Bradford was also to train Parker the skills of the printing trade. Parker became a liability instead of an asset for Bradford when there was little printing work available. He decided in April 1733 to sell the remaining 21 months left on Parker's servant indenture and advertised the sale of his indenture. Parker ran away on May 17 before Bradford had a chance to sell the remaining indenture. Parker became a "wanted man," and Bradford advertised a reward for his capture in his "New-York Gazette" newspaper. The runaway ad described Parker as "an Apprentice lad...by trade a Printer, aged about 19 years; he is of a fresh Completion with short yellowish hair." A reward was offered, which was doubled a short time later.
