The 2004–05 NBA season was the Hawks' 56th season in the National Basketball Association, and 37th season in Atlanta. It was their first season under new head coach Mike Woodson. Despite the offseason acquisitions of All-Star forward Antoine Walker from the Dallas Mavericks, Al Harrington from the Indiana Pacers and re-signing free agent Kevin Willis, the Hawks were not expected to be any good heading into the season as they posted an awful 2–12 record in November. Along the way, the team acquired Tyronn Lue from the Houston Rockets.
