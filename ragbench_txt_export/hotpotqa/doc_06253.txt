Coinciding with the designation of several routes in the Interstate Highway System through Utah, the Utah State Legislature made several changes to the Utah State Route system. The bulk of these changes were not visible to the public, but were to unsigned legislative designations only. The primary effect was designating route numbers 1 through 5 for future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah. There were also changes made to a few unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions. Several other routes were truncated or re-assigned or split into multiple designations to allow the Interstate Highway corridors to have a single route number assigned. As very little of the Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily to support future construction. There were a number of cases where the legislative change enacted in 1962 would not be built and signed until years later. Few of the changes made in 1962 are still valid today. As construction of the Interstate Highway system proceeded, additional changes were made. The legislature made a larger change in route designations in 1977, eliminating unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process.
