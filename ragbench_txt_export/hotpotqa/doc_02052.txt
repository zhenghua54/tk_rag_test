The Macintosh IIci is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer as part of its Macintosh II series of computers from September 1989 to February 1993. It is a more powerful version of the Macintosh IIcx, released earlier that year, and shares the same compact case design. With three expansion slots, the IIci improved upon the IIcx's 16 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 FPU, replacing them with 25Â MHz versions of these chips.
