The Arab Kingdom of Syria (Arabic: المملكة العربية السورية‎ ‎ , "al-Mamlakah al-‘Arabīyah as-Sūrīyah ") was the first modern Arab state to come into existence but only lasted a little over four months (8 March–24 July 1920). During its brief existence, the kingdom was led by Sharif Hussein bin Ali's son Faisal bin Hussein. Despite its claims to the territory of Greater Syria, Faisal's government controlled a limited area and was dependent on Britain which, along with France, generally opposed the idea of a Greater Syria and refused to recognize Faisal as its king. The kingdom surrendered to French forces on 24 July 1920.
