Primus is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California, currently composed of bassist/vocalist Les Claypool, guitarist Larry "Ler" LaLonde and drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander. Primus originally formed in 1984 with Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth, later joined by drummer Jay Lane, though the latter two departed the band at the end of 1988. Featuring LaLonde and Alexander, Primus recorded their debut "Suck on This" in 1989, followed by four studio albums: "Frizzle Fry", "Sailing the Seas of Cheese", "Pork Soda", and "Tales from the Punchbowl". Alexander left the band in 1996, replaced by Bryan "Brain" Mantia, and Primus went on to record the original theme song for the TV show "South Park" and two more albums, "Brown Album" and "Antipop", before declaring a hiatus in 2000.
