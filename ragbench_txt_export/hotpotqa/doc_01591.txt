Thomas King Forçade (September 11, 1945 – November 17, 1978), a.k.a. Gary Goodson, was an American underground journalist and cannabis rights activist in the 1970s. For many years he ran the Underground Press Syndicate (later called the Alternative Press Syndicate), and was the founder in summer 1974 of "High Times" magazine. "High Times" ran articles calling marijuana a "medical wonder drug" and ridiculing the US Drug Enforcement Administration. "High Times" became a huge success with a circulation of more than 500,000 copies a month and revenues approaching $10 million by 1977 and embraced by the young adult market as the bible of the alternative life culture. By 1977 "High Times" was selling as many copies an issue as" Rolling Stone "and "National Lampoon. "Forcade published several other publications such as" Stoned, National Weed, Dealer" and others that always were laced with some of the best humor, pop culture and a forum for some of the best writers, artists and political savvy mostly veiled as the counter culture entertainment magazine. Many of the writers went on to be published in premiere papers and magazines in North America.
