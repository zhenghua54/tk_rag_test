"Mulder and Scully" is a song by Catatonia, released as a single from their 1998 album, "International Velvet". The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci-fi TV series "The X-Files" who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In an interview Cerys Matthews, co-writer of the song, explained that while she was not a serious fan of the show, the basic premise of the series matched the conceit of what she was trying to express.
