The Hangar, formerly known as Lancaster Municipal Stadium and Clear Channel Stadium, is a stadium in Lancaster, California. It is built just off California State Route 14. It is primarily used for baseball, and is the home field of the Lancaster JetHawks minor league baseball team of the California League. It was built in 1996 and was known as the Lancaster Municipal Stadium. In 2005, Clear Channel Communications entered into a 10-year, $770,000 naming rights deal with the JetHawks and the City of Lancaster. The City of Lancaster and the JetHawks will divide the revenue from the deal equally. The deal runs through the 2014 season. However, the signage stating Clear Channel Stadium was removed during the 2012 season and the stadium is now known as The Hangar, its nickname since the stadium opened in 1996.
