Westminster City Council v Duke of Westminster was a legal case between Westminster City Council and Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster heard in November 1990. The dispute concerned 532 flats in Page Street, Vincent Street and Regency Street, Pimlico, London. These had been designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and erected between 1928-30 for Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. In 1937 the Duke assigned the properties - for a peppercorn rent of 1 shilling - to the council on a 999-year lease with the stipulation that they be used only as "dwellings for the working classes... and no other purpose."
