"Electrical Storm" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It was released as a single from their second compilation album, "The Best of 1990–2000", and was one of the two new songs recorded for that album (the other one being "The Hands That Built America"). The music video for the song prominently features drummer Larry Mullen Jr., as well as actress Samantha Morton. The song was written by Bono and is about two lovers who are fighting and the tension between them; it relates this to a looming electrical storm. U2 did not play the song live until 2 July 2009, when they performed it on the second concert of their U2 360° Tour in Barcelona.
