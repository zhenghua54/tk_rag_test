Joe Piripitzi is an Australian rock musician. He was the founding drummer of the rockabilly band, The Living End, from 1994 to 1996; which formed in Melbourne with Chris Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Scott Owen on double bass and backing vocals. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance. Piripitzi is recorded on their first two extended plays, "Hellbound" (1995) and "It's for Your Own Good" (November 1996).
