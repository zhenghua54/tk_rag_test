The Contra Costa Times was a daily newspaper based in Walnut Creek, California, U.S.. The paper served Contra Costa and eastern Alameda counties, in the eastern part of the San Francisco Bay Area. The "Times" also published four other editions under different titles ("West County Times", "East County Times", "San Ramon Valley Times", and "Valley Times") with essentially the same content, serving distinct communities within its circulation area. In 2007 the Contra Costa Times was merged with Alameda News Group to form a new entity called Bay Area News Group-East Bay (BANG-EB), which is in turn owned by MediaNews Group.
