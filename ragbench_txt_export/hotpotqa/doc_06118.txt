Reverie is the third full-length studio album by Cherie Currie. Released on iTunes March 16, 2015. Cherie released the CD version of this album June 5, 2015 on her eBay page cheriecurriedirect. There is a 35-year gap between Cherie's last full-length studio album, 1980's Messin' with the Boys (with Marie Currie), and 2015's Reverie. This is last studio album Kim Fowley produced before his death. Kim helped Cherie release this album to make amends with her after all the money he swindled her out of when she was in the Runaways and for releasing her and Marie's music on Young and Wild without their approval. After Kim's death Cherie's son, Jake Hays, took over producing.
