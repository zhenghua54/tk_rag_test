The 1991–92 NBA season was the Hawks' 43rd season in the National Basketball Association, and 24th season in Atlanta. During the offseason, the Hawks acquired Maurice Cheeks from the New York Knicks. The Hawks had a complete change of guards turning over their backcourt to second-year guard Rumeal Robinson, and top draft pick Stacey Augmon out of UNLV. However, with a 22–20 record in late January, Dominique Wilkins ruptured his achilles tendon and was out for the remainder of the season. Without Wilkins, the Hawks would lose 24 of their final 40 games, including a 7-game losing streak. They finished fifth in the Central Division with a 38–44 record, missing the playoffs and losing a tie-breaker for the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference to the Miami Heat.
