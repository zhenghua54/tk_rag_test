"I Do" is a song by Filipino singer Nina from her self-titled third studio album, "Nina". It was released as the lead single of the album in August 2006 by Warner Music Philippines. The song was written by Joleen Belle, Michael Jay, Carsten Lindberg Hansen and Joachim Svare, and it was produced by Warner personnel Neil Gregorio. It is one of her few original singles. It is also her first upbeat pop-R&B-dance single, since her 2003 number one hit "Make You Mine". The song is described to be Mariah Carey-like, due to Nina's evident use of whistle register and upper-pitch trajectories in the last part of the song.
