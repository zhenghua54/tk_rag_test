Eucryphia is a small genus of trees and large shrubs native to the south temperate regions of South America and coastal eastern Australia. Sometimes placed in a family of their own, the Eucryphiaceae, more recent classifications place them in the Cunoniaceae. There are seven species, two in South America and five in Australia, and several named hybrids. They are mostly evergreen though one species ("E. glutinosa") is usually deciduous.
