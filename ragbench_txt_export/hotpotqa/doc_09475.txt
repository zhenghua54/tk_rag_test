United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993) , was a United States Supreme Court case that distinguished between forfeiture and waiver. Quoting from "Johnson v. Zerbst", 304 U.S. 458 (1938) , the Court noted, "Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver is the "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right... Whether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake."
