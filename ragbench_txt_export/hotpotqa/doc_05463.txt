Quicken Loans Inc., is a mortgage lending company headquartered in the One Campus Martius building in the heart of the financial district of downtown Detroit, Michigan. In 2012, it became the second largest overall retail lender in the U.S. (it is also the largest online retail mortgage lender). Unlike other large mortgage lenders that depend on deposits, Quicken Loans relies on wholesale funding to make its loans and uses online applications rather than a branch system. Title Source and One Reverse Mortgage are also part of the Quicken Loans Family of Companies. Quicken Loans closed $79 billion in home loan volume in 2015.
