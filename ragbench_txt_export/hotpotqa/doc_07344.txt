Bring Me Sunshine (1994) was originally a three-part retrospective in tribute to Eric Morecambe and was hosted by the comedian and author Ben Elton; the first episode was screened on 14 May 1994, which would have been his 68th birthday and featured interviews with many people who had guest starred in "The Morecambe & Wise Show" during its run from 1968 to 1977 and also had a host of memorable clips from the shows. Those interviewed included John Thaw, Roy Castle who died a few months afterwards, Diana Rigg as well as comments and tributes from modern day double acts Hale & Pace and Fry & Laurie.
