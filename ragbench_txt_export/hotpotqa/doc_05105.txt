Doxbin was a document sharing and publishing website which invited users to contribute personally identifiable information, or "dox", of any person of interest. It was previously operated on the darknet as a Tor hidden service, by a person known on the internet as nachash. Since its takedown in 2014, nachash has stepped down and relieved his ownership to a predecessor that used the username, king oren, when interviewed. He told in an interview that he is hosting the Doxbin on public access, referring to World Wide Web, along with he is hosting it on darknet and Tor hidden service websites, although he would not release the link to either of them and was quoted as saying, "The people that use the service, know how to find it, that's what keeps it secure and out of the reach of incompetent people using it for malice things."
