Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, {'1': ", '2': ", '3': ", '4': "} ( ; 9 May 1860 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland but moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in "The Little White Bird"), then to write "Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up", a "fairy play" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.
