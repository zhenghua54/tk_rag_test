LeSourdsville Lake Amusement Park was an amusement park located in Middletown, Ohio. Opening in 1922 as a family picnic and campground, LeSourdsville Lake transformed in the 1940s to an amusement park with rides, attractions, and an arcade. In 1977, the name was changed to Americana Amusement Park. Following an electrical fire in 1990 that caused over $5 million in damages, the park fell into decline and was eventually closed in 1999. Under new ownership, the park briefly opened again in 2002 returning to the name "LeSourdsville Lake Amusement Park", but after failed attempts to turn a profit and the operating company going bankrupt, it closed permanently near the end of the 2002 season. The park's remaining rides and attractions were either demolished or sold, or still sit today.
