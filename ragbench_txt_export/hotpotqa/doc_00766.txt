Urban Cowboy is a 1980 American romantic drama film about the love-hate relationship between Buford Uan "Bud" Davis (John Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger). The movie captured the late 1970s/early 1980s popularity of country music. It was John Travolta's third major acting role after "Saturday Night Fever" and " Grease". Much of the action centers around activities at Gilley's Club, a honky tonk in Pasadena, Texas.
