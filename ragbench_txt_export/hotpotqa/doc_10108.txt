Toni Wine (born June 4, 1947 in Washington Heights, New York City, United States) is an American pop music songwriter, who wrote songs for such artists as The Mindbenders ("A Groovy Kind of Love"), Tony Orlando and Dawn ("Candida"), Elvis Presley, and Checkmates, Ltd. ("Black Pearl") in the late 1960s and 1970s. Wine also sang the female vocals for the cartoon music group The Archies, most notably on their #1 hit song "Sugar, Sugar" (singing the line, "I'm gonna make your life so sweet"). However, she did not sing the lead vocal in the song "Jingle Jangle", but her voice is quite prevalent in the chorus; the lead was sung by Ron Dante using his falsetto voice. In addition, Wine was a backing vocalist on Gene Pitney's "It Hurts to Be in Love" and on Willie Nelson's "Always on My Mind."
