Lithuania is divided into three layers of administrative divisions. The first-level division consists of 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – "apskritis", plural – "apskritys"). These are sub-divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: plural – "savivaldybės", singular – "savivaldybė"), which in turn are further sub-divided into over 500 smaller groups, known as elderships (Lithuanian: plural – "seniūnijos", singular – "seniūnija").
