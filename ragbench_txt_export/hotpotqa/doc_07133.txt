Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus is an extinct subspecies of "Rhinoceros sondaicus", that lived in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia. The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam. Only this species, the Stieng called them Pai-mhai once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.
