Polycyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate (PCT) is a thermoplastic polyester formed from the polycondensation of terephthalic acid and cyclohexanedimethanol.Its chemical structure is similar to that of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with which it shares properties like dimensional stability and chemical resistance. PCT is also particularly resistant to high temperatures and hydrolysis. The melting point is 545 °F (285 °C). Common brand names are "Thermx" (Ticona), "Eastar" (Eastman) and "SkyPURA" (SK Chemicals).
