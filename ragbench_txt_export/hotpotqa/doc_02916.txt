Edward S. Stephens (c. 1849 â€“ September 30, 1909) was an educator in the United States in the late 19th century. He was the first principal of the Catholic Hill School, the first public school for African Americans in Asheville, North Carolina. During his time in Asheville, Stephens and other prominent African American citizens, with the support of heir and philanthropist George Washington Vanderbilt II, established the Young Men's Institute, modeled after the Young Men's Christian Association. Asheville's noted Stephens-Lee High School (now Stephens-Lee Recreation Center), the successor to the Catholic Hill School, which burned down in 1917, was partially named after Stephens.
