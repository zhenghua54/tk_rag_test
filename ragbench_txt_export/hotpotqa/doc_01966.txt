The peso (established as the "peso convertible") is the currency of Argentina, identified by the symbol $ preceding the amount in the same way as many countries using dollar currencies. It is subdivided into 100 "centavos". Its ISO 4217 code is ARS. Several earlier currencies of Argentina were also called "peso"; as inflation progressed a new currency with a few zeroes dropped and a different qualifier (peso "national currency", peso "law 18188", peso "argentino"...) was introduced. Since 1970, thirteen zeroes have been dropped (a factor of ten trillion).
