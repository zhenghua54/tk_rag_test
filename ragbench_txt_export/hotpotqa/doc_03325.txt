Elements is an American animated miniseries based on the show "Adventure Time" by Pendleton Ward. It aired as part of the show's ninth season on Cartoon Network from April 24 to April 27, 2017. "Adventure Time" follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape, grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, which itself follows the events of the "Islands" miniseries, Finn, Jake, and BMO return home to discover that Ooo has been turned into a veritable dystopia thanks to extreme elemental magic. Finn and Jake team up with Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Betty (voiced by Felicia Day), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward) to set things straight.
