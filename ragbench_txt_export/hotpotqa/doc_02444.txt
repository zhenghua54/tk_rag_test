Boylan Bottling Company is an American gourmet soft drink manufacturer located in New York City. The company was located in Haledon, New Jersey from the late 1950s until 2001, when its facilities were relocated to Clifton, New Jersey for a short time before again being relocated to Moonachie, then Teterboro, and, in 2013, New York City. The Boylan brand was registered in 1891. As part of their gourmet image, Boylan has only used cane sugar to sweeten their beverages, while most other American beverage manufacturers use high fructose corn syrup due to the prohibitive cost of purchasing sugar (two to three times higher than the rest of the world) for mass production.
