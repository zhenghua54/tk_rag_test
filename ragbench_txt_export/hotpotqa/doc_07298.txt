The 1998–99 NBA season was the 29th season for the Portland Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Blazers signed free agents Jim Jackson and Greg Anthony, who would reunite with his former UNLV teammate Stacey Augmon. Portland got off to a fast start winning 15 of their first 18 games, and went 35–15 in the lockout-shortened season, earning their fourth Pacific Division title and the first since 1991–92. Their record qualified them for the #2 seed in the Western Conference. The team earned their 17th straight trip to the playoffs, and 22nd in 23 years. Head coach Mike Dunleavy was named Coach of The Year.
