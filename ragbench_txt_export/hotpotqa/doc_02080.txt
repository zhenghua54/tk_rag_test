Total Drama Island (sometimes shortened to TDI) is a Canadian animated television series which premiered in Canada on Teletoon on July 8, 2007 and on June 5, 2008 in the U.S. on Cartoon Network. This is the first season of the "Total Drama" series and has 27 episodes, each 22 minutes in duration with a special 44 minute episode at the end. The season is mostly a parody of the series "Survivor", which consists of twenty-two campers in an elimination-based competition. On the Cartoon Network airing in the United States, some content has been removed from the episodes by censors in order to keep the rating open to a younger audience; for example, putting in words instead of long bleeps, and censoring of sensitive body parts, for the episodes "That's Off the Chain" and "Trial by Tri-Armed Triathlon". The fourth season, "", also takes place on the same island as this season, but with an all-new cast. "Total Drama Island" was created by Tom McGillis and Jennifer Pertsch with their production studio, Fresh TV, which also created their previous animated series, "6teen".
