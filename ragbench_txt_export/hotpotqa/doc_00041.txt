Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS) is the integrated pay and personnel system for active duty and reserve Marines, and the authoritative source of data for all Marine Corps (MC) pay and personnel information consisting of over 550,000 records. MCTFS has been successfully fielded and is currently in its post deployment system support phase of its lifecycle. MCTFS supports centralized business-critical pay functions for the Marine Corps Enterprise on time and accurately, including computation and payment of net pay to individual Marines, while accommodating all necessary system change requests to meet current legislative, regulatory, mission essential, force reset, and contingency change requirements. MCTFS is maintained in an audit compliant state to ensure accurate financial transactions and reporting. MCTFS includes a comprehensive history of pay entitlements, deductions, and payments for each active duty and reserve Marine. The principle advocate within the Marine Corps is the Deputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve Affairs.
