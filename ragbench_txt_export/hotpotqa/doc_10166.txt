Track Marshall was a brand of earthmoving equipment who were active during WWII building tanks. Later, they produced a range of crawler tractors, based on the wheeled tractor "Field Marshall" brand. In 1956 the first Track Marshall bulldozer model was introduced and later the Challenger 3 followed by the Challenger 33, the "TM55" and also the successful six-cylinder "TM70" (probably equivalent to a Caterpillar D5). They also built the TM 955 track loader (a "drott") and also a range of rubber tracked bulldozers. The company was in business for some 50 years, eventually closing in 1990 after new machines replaced older technology.
