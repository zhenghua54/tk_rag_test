The Last Express is an adventure video game designed by Jordan Mechner and published by Br√∏derbund in 1997. It takes place on the Orient Express, days before the start of World War I. It is noted as being one of the few video games that attempts to realistically simulate real time. The game was a commercial disappointment, but received highly positive reviews and a positive post-release response. A Sony PlayStation port was planned and was almost finished for release, but was cancelled for unknown reasons.
