The Velvet Rope is the sixth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. The album was released on October 7, 1997 through Virgin Records America. Following the release of her first greatest hits compilation "" (1995), Jackson's recording contract with Virgin was up for renewal, making her the subject of a high-profile bidding war among parties including Sony Music, Bertelsmann, DreamWorks, Time Warner, PolyGram and The Walt Disney Company. She ultimately renewed her contract with Virgin for an unprecedented US$80 million, the largest recording contract in history at that time.
