Nyoka the Jungle Girl is a fictional character created for the screen in the 1941 serial "Jungle Girl", starring Frances Gifford as Nyoka Meredith. The character of Nyoka is often described as having been created by Edgar Rice Burroughs; however, although the serial was officially based on Burroughs' story "Jungle Girl" (first appearing in the pulp magazine, "Blue Book", and later published as a novel), there is no character named Nyoka and no Nyoka-like character in the original story. The movie's credits list Burroughs along with six other writers, but his input on creating the film character was obviously minimal, because the studio later was able to use the name "Nyoka" in a sequel without crediting Burroughs at all. After the initial film, Nyoka appeared in comic books published by Fawcett, Charlton, and AC Comics.
