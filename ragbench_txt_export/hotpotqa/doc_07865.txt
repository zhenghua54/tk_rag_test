Word Streak (formerly Scramble with Friends) is a word game developed by Zynga with Friends for iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android and released in January 2012. Gameplay is similar to that of "Boggle" - players try to find as many words as possible in a jumbled 4x4 grid of letters by connecting adjacent letters to form words within a two-minute time frame - though with extra features and a different scoring system. Words may be formed vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. "Scramble with Friends" is one of the top ranking games in the iOS application store, available as both a free ad-supported version and an ad-less paid version. "Scramble with Friends" replaced "Scramble Challenge" at the end of 2011, but did not retain the solitaire option of the latter.
