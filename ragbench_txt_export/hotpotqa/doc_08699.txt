Heinrich Scholz (] ; December 17, 1884 – December 30, 1956) was a German logician, philosopher, and Protestant theologian who was a peer of Alan Turing, who wrote in his memoirs that he on the inclusion of his essay from 1936 "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" [was disappointed that only] two people could have understood it, and would have responded [had he been asked] – Heinrich Scholz and Richard Bevan Braithwaite. Scholz had an extraordinary career but was not considered a brilliant logician, for example on the same level as Gottlob Frege or Rudolf Carnap, but was considered an outstanding scientist of national importance. He provided a suitable academic environment for his students to thrive. He founded the Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at the University of Münster in 1936, which can be said enabled the study of logic at the highest international level after World War 2 up until the present day.
