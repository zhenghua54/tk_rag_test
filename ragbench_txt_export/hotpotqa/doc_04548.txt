Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams (February 12, 1775 – May 15, 1852), wife of John Quincy Adams, was First Lady of the United States from 1825 to 1829. The daughter of the American Consul in London, she was the first First Lady to be born outside the United States, or outside areas that were later to become part of the United States, such as the Thirteen Colonies – a distinction that would not be replicated until 192 years later by Melania Trump.
