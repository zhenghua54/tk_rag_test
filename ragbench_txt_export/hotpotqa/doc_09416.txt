The Sandersâ€“Brown Center on Aging at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, is responsible for research, education and service programs in aging. The program was founded in 1963 with the creation of the Council on Aging. In 1972, a grant from the Eleanor and John Y. Brown Jr., Foundation led to the construction of the current facility. The center was named for the Browns and his then-business partner, (Col.) Harlan Sanders. The four-story brick and concrete structure fronts South Limestone at the edge of the medical campus. The complex features 32 research laboratories that employs more than 150.
