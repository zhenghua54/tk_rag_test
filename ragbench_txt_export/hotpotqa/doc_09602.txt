Wolf Junge was a German naval officer of World War II. As a Kapitän zur See, he was appointed the executive officer of the battleship "Tirpitz" in August 1943 under Kapitän zur See Hans Meyer. He temporarily took control of the ship on 3 April 1944 when Meyer was badly wounded during the Operation Tungsten air attack on "Tirpitz". Junge was subsequently confirmed in this role during May. However, he was unpopular with the battleship's crew as he was perceived to have had little experience operating warships at sea. Junge handed command of "Tirpitz" to Kapitän zur See Robert Weber in November 1944.
