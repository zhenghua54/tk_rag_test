John Don Looney (September 2, 1916 – April 5, 2015) was a professional American football end in the National Football League. He was born in Sulphur Springs, Texas. He played three seasons for the Philadelphia Eagles (1940) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (1941–1942). He was the first receiver in NFL history to have over 100 yards receiving in each of his first two games, a feat which was not equaled until the 2008 NFL season by another Eagles wide receiver, DeSean Jackson. At the time of his death, Looney was the second oldest living former NFL player. He was the father of NFL running back Joe Don Looney, who later died in a one-person motorcycle accident after his NFL career ended.
