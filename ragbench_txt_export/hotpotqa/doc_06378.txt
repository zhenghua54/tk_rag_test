The tidal force is a force that is the secondary effect of the force of gravity; it is responsible for the phenomenon of tides. It arises because the gravitational force exerted by one body on another is not constant across it: the nearest side is attracted more strongly than the farthest side. Thus, the tidal force is differential. Consider the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the oceans nearest to the Moon, the solid Earth and the oceans farthest from the Moon. There is a mutual attraction between the Moon and the solid Earth, which can be considered to act on its centre of mass. However, the near oceans are more strongly attracted and, especially since they are fluid, they approach the Moon slightly, causing a high tide. The far oceans are attracted less. The attraction on the far-side oceans could be expected to cause a low tide, but since the solid Earth is attracted (accelerated) more strongly towards the moon, there is a "relative" acceleration of those waters in the outwards direction. Viewing the Earth as a whole, we see that all its mass experiences a mutual attraction with that of the Moon, but the near oceans more so than the far oceans, leading to a separation of the two.
