The Australian Women's Weekly, sometimes known as simply "The Weekly", is an Australian monthly women's magazine published by Bauer Media Group in Sydney. For many years it was the number one magazine in Australia but it is now outsold by the Australian edition of the American publication "Better Homes and Gardens".
