The Belize National Youth Chess Foundation (B.N.Y.C.F.) was co-founded by Ian & Ella Anderson in the summer of 2007 as a not-for-profit organization and with a small army of volunteers it spread throughout the country. The game of Chess has been around for a very long time but in Belize there were no formal organizations and no figures to indicate how many people were playing the game. Building on the founding by Mr. Robert Landolfi and Mr. Glen Reneau of the first school chess club at Hummingird Elementary and the Belize Association of Chess Players in Belize City, due to the efforts of the B.N.Y.C.F. there are now teams ranging from the most southern villages in Toledo District to the most northern villages along the Belize-Mexico border in the Corozal District. Since 2007, the organization has more than 50 active chess clubs and over 1400 players around the country and it functions all year round. An interview with Ian Anderson, Co-Chair, reveals that chess is not only a pastime or hobby in Belize; it can and should be used “as an educational tool to help develop the minds of primary school students.” The B.N.Y.C.F. has worked with primary schools to successfully integrate chess as a part of the curriculum of the primary schools in Belize. Within one year the game of Chess became the fastest growing sport in the country. As part of its efforts to promote this sport, the B.N.Y.C.F. assisted the Belize Chess Federation to become active again in 2008 by updating fees due to FIDE, the World Chess affiliate.
