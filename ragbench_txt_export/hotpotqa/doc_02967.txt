The evil clown is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead rendered as disturbing through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by Stephen King's 1986 novel "It". The character can be seen as playing off the sense of unease felt by sufferers of coulrophobia.
