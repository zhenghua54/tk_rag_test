The 1991 Calder Cup playoffs of the American Hockey League began on April 2, 1991. Ten teams, five from each division, qualified for the playoffs. The top three teams in each division received a bye for the preliminary round while the fourth- and fifth-placed teams in each division played a two-game series with the winners advancing to the Division Semifinals; if each team won one game, the series winner was decided in sudden-death "super overtime" immediately following Game 2. The eight remaining teams then played best-of-seven series for Division Semifinals and Division Finals. The division champions played a best-of-seven series for the Calder Cup. The Calder Cup Final ended on May 24, 1991, with the Springfield Indians defeating the Rochester Americans four games to two to win the Calder Cup for the second consecutive year, and the seventh and final time in team history. This was a rematch of the 1990 Calder Cup Final where Springfield defeated Rochester four games to two. Similarly, a Springfield goaltenderâ€”this time Kay Whitmore -- won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.
