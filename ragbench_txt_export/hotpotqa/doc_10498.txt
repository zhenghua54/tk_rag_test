Quad Studios Nashville is a four-studio recording facility located on Music Row in Nashville, TN. The studio was originally opened in 1971 as Quadrafonic Sound Studio by session musicians David Briggs and Norbert Putnam. The studio immediately became the home of many major recording sessions including Neil Young's "Harvest" album which included the single "Heart of Gold," Jimmy Buffett's biggest hit "Margaritaville" from his best selling album Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes, much of Joan Baez' early 1970s work, including her hit recording of "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" and Dobie Gray's R&B classic "Drift Away." Other artists to record at the studio in the early years include Dan Fogelberg, Grand Funk Railroad, The Jackson Five, The Pointer Sisters, Joe Walsh and The James Gang, and many others.
