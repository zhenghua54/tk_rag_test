The albums discography of Wanda Jackson, an American recording artist, consists of forty-five studio albums, one international studio album, seven tribute and cover albums, four live albums, twenty-one compilation albums, and two box sets. In 1954 at age sixteen, Jackson signed with Decca Records as a country music artist. The label did not issue a record until the 1962 compilation "Lovin' Country Style", six years after Jackson left Decca. She signed with Capitol Records in 1956, and her self-titled debut studio album was released three years later. Although Jackson had recently been identifying herself as a rock-and-roll performer, the album consisted of country music recordings. However, it did contain Jackson's future rock-and-roll hit "Let's Have a Party", which was a hit in 1960, reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard Pop chart. The success of her rock-and-roll recordings led to the release of two more rock-and-roll studio LPs: "Rockin' with Wanda" (1960) and "There's a Party Goin' On" (1961). Additionally, Capitol issued two "split" studio albums ("Right or Wrong" and "Two Sides of Wanda") which contained rock and roll on one side and country music on the other.
