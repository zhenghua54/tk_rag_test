Anna Ecklund (sometimes documented as Emma Schmidt) was an American woman whose alleged demonic possession and exorcism occurred over several decades, culminating in an extensive exorcism that lasted from August 18 to December 23, 1928 in Earling, Iowa. Ecklund was said to have exhibited symptoms akin to possession beginning at age fourteen, and was forty six-years-old during her final exorcism by Father Theophilus Riesinger, a German Roman Catholic priest.
