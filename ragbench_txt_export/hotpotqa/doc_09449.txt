"Teardrops on My Guitar" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of "Rolling Stone") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of "PopMatters") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements.
