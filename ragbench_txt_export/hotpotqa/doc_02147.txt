Alliance 90/The Greens Hamburg is the Hamburg state association of Alliance '90/The Greens. Until 21 April 2012, it was known as the "Green-Alternative List" ("Gr√ºn-Alternative Liste"). Though most green-alternative lists are not part of Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany, Hamburg was special in that its GAL had been the Hamburg state association of the party since 1984.
