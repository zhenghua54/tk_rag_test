The Kabalas were a four-piece band out of the Quad Cities area of the American Mid-West whose musical foundations were based firmly in a traditional Eastern European Klezmer style that mixed in Jewish folksongs, Israeli popular songs, Polka and popular music. The members of the band were Scott Morschhauser (vocals, accordion, guitar, percussion); Barry "The Wolfman" Wolf (accordion); "Nervous" Neal Smith (saxophones, backup vocals, flute, clarinet); and the late "Mr." Joel Dick (drums, percussion). On stage, their performance was a blend of vaudeville antics and great musicianship. Their traditional closing song was "Hey Lordy Mambo" where the drummer would play with four sticks and set them on fire.
