The Half the Sky Movement is inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's best-selling book . The movement seeks to put an end to the oppression of women and girls worldwide through a transmedia project that uses video, websites, games, blogs and other educational tools both to raise awareness of women's issues and also to provide concrete steps to fight these problems and empower women.
