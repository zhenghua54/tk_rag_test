Mark Britten is an American comedian from Arlington, Texas, whose chosen stage name is "The Chinaman". Born of a Chinese-American mother and a Caucasian father, his act employs material from his "dysfunctional background" and skews ethnic stereotypes of all kinds. He has been a performing stand-up comic for ten years, and is known for his voice impersonations, parodies of rock singers and other vocalists and biting anecdotes about the foibles of ethnic and cultural stereotypes. "The Austin Chronicle" describes him as "a rock star trapped in a comicâ€™s body." He is a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
