Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe is a short documentary film directed by Les Blank in 1980 which depicts director Werner Herzog living up to his promise that he would eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever completed the film "Gates of Heaven". The film includes clips from both "Gates of Heaven" and Herzog's 1970 feature "Even Dwarfs Started Small". Comic song "Old Whisky Shoes", played by the Walt Solek Band, is the signature tune over the opening and closing credits.
