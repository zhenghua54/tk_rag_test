Francis Xavier Velarde (1897 – 28 December 1960) was an English architect who practiced in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He was trained at the Liverpool School of Architecture from 1920, and from 1928 taught at the school. In 1957 he was awarded the OBE. His works are located mainly in Merseyside and Northwest England, and most of them were churches. He was influenced by architectural developments on the Continent, in particular by the German Dominikus Böhm. It is unlikely that he was at all influenced by his Chilean father who died when he was five years old, he was later destined for a career in the merchant navy but was conscripted from there into the RNVR a served I in the trenches to be gassed at Paschendale, thus inevitably shortening his life, on leaving the army he went to Liverpool art school where he was discovered by Charles Riley and given a place at Liverpool School of Architecture.
