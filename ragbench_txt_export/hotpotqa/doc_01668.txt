The Native American Renaissance is a term originally coined by critic Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book "Native American Renaissance" to categorise the significant increase in production of literary works by Native Americans in the United States in the late 1960s and onwards. A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of N. Scott Momaday's "House Made of Dawn" in 1968". Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969.
