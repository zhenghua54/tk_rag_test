Lantern Waste is a fictional place in "The Chronicles of Narnia" series by C. S. Lewis. It is a wood and is notable as the place where Lucy Pevensie and Mr. Tumnus meet, which is the first scene of Narnia described in the books. The lamppost in the wood is an iconic image of Narnia, and the question of its origin is what convinced Lewis to write more than one book on Narnia. One of King Edmund's titles is "Duke of Lantern Waste".
