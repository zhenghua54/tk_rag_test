The Red Cedar Inn opened in Pacific, Missouri, just after Prohibition ended. In 1932, Route 66 reached Pacific, and the town got an economic boost. Before that, Pacific's main commerce had been the mining of silica used to make fine glassware and construction materials, such as bricks. The Red Cedar Inn was a full service restaurant and served cocktails, since Prohibition had been repealed just before its opening. The inn became popular with travelers on Route 66 and was visited by baseball players Bob Klinger, Dizzy Dean, and Ted Williams.
