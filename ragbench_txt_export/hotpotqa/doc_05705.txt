Raumschiff Highlander (translated: Starship Highlander) is a fan-created science fiction film and novel series. The series was initiated in 1993 by Robert Amper. Originally, a fan club of science fiction, especially for "" (aka "ST:TOS" or just "TOS"), and the Star Wars movies, whose members met regularly. Some members having experience in filmmaking, the idea spawned of creating material for a movie. First episode of the series aired in 1995 on German TV Channel SAT.1. Inspired by the success of their movie came four additional sequels at the rate of one per year. The movies are a parody of Star Trek and other classics of the genre.
