Galati Brothers Supermarkets was a family owned and run Italian grocery store chain in the Toronto area. Founded in 1958 by Tony Galati & Frank Galati, the stores were smaller than traditional supermarkets and carried many Italian items. Most of the stores were located in areas where there was a large number of Italian-Canadians. Some stores have been branded separately as Galati Market Fresh. Galati Brothers Supermarkets came to a close when then its final store (2592 Finch Avenue West) was sold upon the retirement of Tony Galati. Galati Market Fresh is still running in North York, on Leslie Street by Frank Galati's two children Robert and Grace Galati.
