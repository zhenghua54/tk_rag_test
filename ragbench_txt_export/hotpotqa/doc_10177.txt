Il Marchese del Grillo ("The Marquess Del Grillo", internationally released as "The Marquis of Grillo") is a 1981 Italian comedic motion picture directed by Mario Monicelli, starring Alberto Sordi as the title character. The film depicts early nineteenth-century episodes in the life of a nobleman in Rome. Loosely based on folkloric accounts of the real Onofrio del Grillo (who lived in the eighteenth century), this character plays a number of pranks, one even involving Pope Pius VII. The famous line "Io s√≤ io, e voi non siete un cazzo" (literally "I am who I am, and you are fuck all"), is appropriated from Belli's 1831 sonnet, "The Sovrans of the Old World".
