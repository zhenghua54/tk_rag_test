Vladimir Reznikov (died June 13, 1986, Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York City) was a Russian American gangster. After attempting to retrieve money owed to him for a fraudulent gas license provided by Marat Balagula (who he sold bootlegged gasoline for in a western New York gas station, among many other enterprises) Reznikov was shot dead by the Lucchese crime family, to whom Balagula was paying street tax. Reznikov's murder remained unsolved until the 1994 cooperation of Lucchese acting boss Anthony Casso. According to Casso, the shooting was actually committed by Joseph Testa and Anthony Senter, two veterans of the DeMeo crew.
