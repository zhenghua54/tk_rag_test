Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories is a collection of stories by American writer Samuel R. Delany, published by Vintage Books in 2003. It is a thematically arranged collection, in the style of James Joyce’s "Dubliners" (1914), Sherwood Anderson’s "Winesburg, Ohio" (1919), and Willa Cather’s "Youth and the Bright Medusa" (1920). The book is closely based on an earlier collection, "Driftglass", which first appeared in 1971. The dedication to the two books is similar: one is simply an updated version of the other, dedicating the book to Delany’s immediate family: his maternal grandmother, mother, sister, and father. Both carry identical epigraphs. The ten tales contained in "Driftglass" are all contained in "Aye, and Gomorrah", along with five other stories ("Omegahelm", "Among the Blobs", "Tapestry", "Prismatica", "Ruins"). The stories consist of ten science fiction tales, in the order the writer wrote them, followed by five fantasies, also in chronological order.
