"Yayo" is a song by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey. It appears on her first extended play, "Kill Kill", her debut album, "Lana Del Ray", and her third EP, "Paradise". After the release of her third EP, the song charted in France. Before signing to a major record label, Del Rey released a self-produced music video for "Yayo". Ubiquitously, the song garnered acclaim, many reviewers saying the song was one of the best songs Del Rey has ever written and praising Del Rey's voice. Appearing on three of Del Rey's albums to date, the song is one of few that was authored solely by her. The original version of the song was released through 5 Point Records and produced by David Kahne, later being remastered by Emile Haynie and Dan Heath.
