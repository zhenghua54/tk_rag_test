Ghost Riders is the sixth album by American southern rock band Outlaws, released in 1980. The album was produced by Gary Lyons. It is regarded by many fans as the last "Outlaws" album that followed their old fashioned southern rock style, and also a comeback after some mediocre albums saleswise. Their cover of "(Ghost) Riders In the Sky" was one of their most successful songs, and has earned the band some attention from outside the southern rock circles.
