Patrick Barnewall (c. 1500â€“1552) was a leading figure in the Irish Government of the 1530s and 1540s, due to his close links with Thomas Cromwell. He sat in the Irish House of Commons, and held the offices of Solicitor General for Ireland and Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Today he is mainly remembered for his role in founding the King's Inns. He belonged to a junior branch of the family of Lord Trimlestown: his own descendants held the title Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland.
