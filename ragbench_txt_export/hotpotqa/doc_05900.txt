Take It Easy is an abstract strategy board game created by Peter Burley. It can be characterized as a spatial bingo-like game, and has been published by Ravensburger and subsequently by several other publishers since 1983. Each player gets a board with places for 19 hexagon tiles to place in a hexagon shape. Additionally, players get identical sets of tiles which have different types of colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions. One player draws a tile randomly and then tells the others which he drew. Each player then puts their matching tile on their board in any available spot. This is repeated until the board is filled. The object is to complete same colored/numbered lines across your board, for which points are scored according to the numbers on those lines. The maximum score possible is 307.
