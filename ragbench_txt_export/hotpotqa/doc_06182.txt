An Essay on Censorship is a lengthy letter, in verse, by Anthony Burgess addressed to his fellow novelist Salman Rushdie. Published in the wake of the 1989 Iranian "fatwa" against Rushdie and the Bradford book-burnings that followed, Burgess's letter has been compared to the "Essay on Man" of Alexander Pope.
