The Liberties (Irish: Na Saoirsí or occasionally Na Libirtí) is an area in central Dublin, Ireland, located to the southwest of the inner city. One of Dublin's most historic working-class neighbourhoods, the area is traditionally associated with social housing, market traders, local family-owned businesses, as well as whiskey distilling, it is now also a centre of enterprise and commercial life in the heart of the city. Today the historic city quarter sits side by side with dynamic media and tech hubs and highly respected medical and education centres.
