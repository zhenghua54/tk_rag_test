Sankarankutti Menon Marath, better known as Menon Marath, (born in 1906 in Kerala â€“ died 2 January 2003) was an Indo-Anglican novelist who settled in England and spent more than half of his life there. Menon graduated from Christian College in Madras (now Chennai) and travelled to England in 1934 to pursue post-graduate studies at King's College London. His first novel "The Wound of Spring" (Dennis Dobson, 1960) is set in pre-independence India, in Kerala, (then comprising Malabar, Cochin and Travancore), in a feudal, matrilineal society. The second novel, "The Sale of an Island" (1964) is a political allegory. The third and last published novel "Janu" is about an orphaned girl seeking the freedoms of recognition as an equal, in friendship, in love.
