The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride attraction located at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Walt Disney World Resort. The attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history. The attraction—which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989—was located inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces.
