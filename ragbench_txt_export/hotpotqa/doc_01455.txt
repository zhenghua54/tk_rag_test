Cudjoe Kazoola Lewis (c. 1840 â€“ 1935), or Cudjo Lewis, was the last known survivor of the Atlantic slave trade between Africa and the United States. Together with 115 other captives, he was brought illegally to the United States on board the ship "Clotilde" in 1860. They were landed in the backwaters near Mobile, Alabama and hidden from authorities. The ship was scuttled to evade discovery.
