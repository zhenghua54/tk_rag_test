Pneumodesmus newmani is a species of millipede that lived in the Paleozoic. Its exact age is uncertain. It was originally interpreted as living  Â million years ago , in the Late Silurian; however, the study conducted by Suarez "et al." (2017) indicates that it actually lived in the Early Devonian (Lochkovian). It is the first myriapod, and the oldest known creature to have lived on land. It was discovered in 2004, and is known from a single specimen from Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
