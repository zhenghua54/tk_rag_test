Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979) , was a United States Supreme Court case related to the Sixth Amendment. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who later became a Supreme Court Justice herself, and Lee Nation argued for Duren in what became Ginsburg's last case before the Supreme Court as an attorney. Part of her argument was that making jury duty optional for women should be struck down because it treated women's service on juries as less valuable than men's.
