Belsay Hall is a notable Regency style 1807 country house located at Belsay, Northumberland. It is regarded as the first British country house to be built in entirely in new, Greek revival style. It is a Grade I listed building. It was built to supersede Belsay Castle and its adjoining earlier hall just a few hundred yards away, and part of the same estate.
