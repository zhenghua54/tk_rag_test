Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales, with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae. The genus contains four species, which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or "cones" of various species of "Banksia", a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia. Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small (typically less than 10 mm diameter), shallow dark cups on the follicles of the "Banksia" fruit. The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards, appearing like narrow slits. The first specimens of "Banksiamyces", known then as "Tympanis toomansis", were described in 1887. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s, leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species, "B. katerinae", "B. macrocarpus", and "B. toomansis". A fourth species, "B. maccannii", was added in 1984.
