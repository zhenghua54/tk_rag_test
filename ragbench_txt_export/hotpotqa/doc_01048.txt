Dropping the Pilot is a political cartoon by Sir John Tenniel, first published in the British magazine "Punch" on 29 March 1890. It depicts Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as a maritime pilot, stepping off a ship (perhaps a reference to Plato's ship of state), idly and unconcernedly watched by a young Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Bismarck had resigned as Chancellor at Wilhelm's demand just ten days earlier on 19 March, as Bismarck's political views were too different from Wilhelm's.
