The Minnesota Institute for Talented Youth (also known simply as MITY, pronounced "mighty") is an institute that offers extracurricular options for gifted and talented students. It is takes place at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Founded in 1967, MITY has become relatively large and has three different programs for primary education and secondary education students. The three programs, YES (Your Extraordinary Saturday), ExplorSchool, and Expand Your Mind, each deal with a separate age group of students, and often share staff members and class styles. YES is for students in grades 1-4, and takes place on Saturdays during the school year. ExplorSchool is offered for students in grades 4-6, and it takes place during the summer, with classes being held Monday through Friday over a two-week period. Expand Your Mind (which many veteran students refer to simply as MITY, due to its popularity) is offered for students in grades 7-12, and takes place during the summer with classes held Monday through Friday over a similar two-week period at Macalester College.
