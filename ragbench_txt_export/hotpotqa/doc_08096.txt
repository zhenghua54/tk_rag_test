North Blenheim is a hamlet in the town of Blenheim, New York. It had the longest wooden, single-span covered bridge in the United States, the Old Blenheim Bridge. It was built in 1855 and existed until 2011, when it was destroyed by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene. The "Blenheim Gilboa Power Project Visitors Center" is also located there.
