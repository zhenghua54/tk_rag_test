The Apparition is a 2012 American supernatural horror film, written and directed by Todd Lincoln, making his directorial debut, and starring Ashley Greene, Sebastian Stan, Tom Felton, Julianna Guill and Rick Gomez. The plot follows three college students who, after the death of their friend, must battle a supernatural force they summoned themselves. The film was loosely inspired by the Philip experiment conducted in 1972. The film was a box office bomb and was cited by critics as one of the worst horror movies of 2012. It was also the last Warner Bros. Pictures horror film to be released under its own label before resorting to New Line Cinema to release all future horror movies made by Warner Bros.
