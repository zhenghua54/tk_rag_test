Liv Glacier is a steep valley glacier, 64 km long, emerging from the Antarctic Plateau just southeast of Barnum Peak and draining north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter Ross Ice Shelf between Mayer Crags and Duncan Mountains. It was discovered in 1911 by Roald Amundsen, who named it for the daughter of Fridtjof Nansen. The airway above the Liv Glacier was used by the monoplane "Floyd Bennett" in 1929 as the route for the first journey to the South Pole by air.
