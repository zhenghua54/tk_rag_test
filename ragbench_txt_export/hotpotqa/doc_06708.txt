Freemium is a pricing strategy by which a product or service (typically a digital offering or application such as software, media, games or web services) is provided free of charge, but money (premium) is charged for additional features, services, or virtual goods. "Freemium" is a portmanteau of "free" and "premium". The business model has been in use by software industry since the 1980s as a licensing scheme. A subset of this model used by the video gaming industry is called free-to-play.
