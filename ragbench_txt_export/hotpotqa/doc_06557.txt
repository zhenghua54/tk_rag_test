Tiv (or Tivi) is an ethno-linguistic group or ethnic nation in West Africa. The group constitutes approximately 7% of Nigeria's total population, and number about 3.5 million individuals throughout Nigeria and Cameroon. The Tiv are the 4th largest ethnic group in Nigeria. The Tiv language is spoken by about 2.2 million people in Nigeria (as of 1991), with a few speakers in Cameroon. Most of the language's Nigerian speakers are found in Benue State of Nigeria. The language is also widely spoken in the Nigerian States of Plateau, Taraba, Nasarawa and Cross River, as well as the FCT Abuja. It is part of the Southern Bantoid Tivoid family, a branch of Benue–Congo and ultimately of the Niger–Congo phylum. In precolonial times, the Fulani ethnic group referred to the Tiv as "Munchi", a term not accepted by Tiv people. They depend on agricultural produce for commerce and life.
