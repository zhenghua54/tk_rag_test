Jacob D. Robida (June 13, 1987 â€“ February 5, 2006) was a Massachusetts teenager who attacked three patrons at a New Bedford gay bar on February 2, 2006. He fled the state and drove to Charleston, West Virginia, where he kidnapped Jennifer Rena Dunlap Bailey and drove southwest. He was stopped by Gassville, Arkansas Police Officer James W. Sell at the Brass Door Restaurant parking lot on the afternoon of February 4, 2006 for an apparent traffic violation. Robida shot and killed Sell and fled east. He turned onto Arkansas Highway 201 headed south and continued to Arkana, where he fired at Arkansas State Police Sgt. Van Nowlin. Deputies from the Baxter County Sheriff's Office had a spike strip deployed a short distance away. Robida drove over the spike strip, flattening both front tires on his Pontiac. He continued to Arkansas Highway 5, where he turned south and drove into the small town of Norfork. In the middle of town he lost control of the car due to the front tires, spun out, and hit two parked vehicles. He then shot Bailey, his kidnap victim, in the head with a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic pistol, killing her instantly. Police then opened fire on Robida. He shot himself in the right side of the head.
