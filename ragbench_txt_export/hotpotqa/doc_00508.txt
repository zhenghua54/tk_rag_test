Life was an American magazine that ran weekly from 1883 to 1936 as a humor magazine with limited circulation. "Time" owner Henry Luce bought the magazine in 1936, solely so that he could acquire the rights to its name, and launched a major weekly news magazine with a strong emphasis on photojournalism. "Life" was published weekly until 1972, as an intermittent "special" until 1978, and as a monthly from 1978 to 2000.
