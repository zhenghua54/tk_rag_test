Hugh (1057 – October 18, 1101), called the Great (Latin "Hugo Magnus"), was a younger son of Henry I of France and Anne of Kiev and younger brother of Philip I. He was Count of Vermandois in right of his wife ("jure uxoris"). His nickname "Magnus" (greater or elder) is probably a bad translation into Latin of a French nickname, "le Maisné", meaning "the younger", referring to Hugh as younger brother of the King of France.
