Zeltnera is a genus of flowering plants in the gentian family. It was erected in 2004 when the genus "Centaurium" (the centauries) was split. Genetic analysis revealed that "Centaurium" was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. "Centaurium" remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus "Gyrandra", and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus "Schenkia". The new name "Zeltnera" was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species.
