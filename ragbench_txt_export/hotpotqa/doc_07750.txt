The feline tribe Acinonychini contains at least two genera: "Puma" (containing two species, the cougar and the jaguarundi) and "Acinonyx" (only one species, the cheetah, has survived). In addition to these three extant species, there is a handful of extinct fossil species that have been found in Eurasia and the Americas. The evolutionary relationships of these cats still needs to be worked out, with the main focus being the placement of the extinct species in relation to the extant species and where cheetahs evolved. While cheetahs and cougars are sometimes considered big cats, they are more closely related to domestic cats than they are to lions and leopards.
