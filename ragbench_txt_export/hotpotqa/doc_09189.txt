Mirador de la Flor (English: Lookout of the Flower ) is a monument in Corpus Christi, Texas that was unveiled in 1997 to honor Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, the Tejano singer who was murdered by her assistant and head of her fan club Yolanda Saldívar, two years earlier at the age of 23. People from around the world visit the site, which is located only a few miles north of Seaside Memorial Park where Selena is buried. It is located at the corner of Peoples Street T-Head and Shoreline Boulevard and consists of a 5'8" life-sized bronze statue of Selena wearing a leather jacket with microphone in hand, sculpted by H.W. "Buddy" Tatum, a Corpus Christi artist. She is leaning against a concrete pillar looking towards the Corpus Christi Bay.
