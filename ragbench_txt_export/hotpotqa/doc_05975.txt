The 2007–08 NBA season was the Atlanta Hawks' 59th season in the National Basketball Association, and 40th season in Atlanta. After missing the playoffs for eight straight seasons, the Hawks selected Al Horford out of the University of Florida with the third pick in the 2007 NBA draft. The Hawks started out the season by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 101–94 in their season opener, marking the first time they won their first game of the season since the 1999 lockout season. However, their struggles continued as they went on a six-game losing streak around the All-Star break. At midseason, the Hawks traded Tyronn Lue, Lorenzen Wright, Anthony Johnson and second-year forward Shelden Williams to the Sacramento Kings for Mike Bibby. The Hawks finished third in the Southeast Division with a 37–45 record, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1999. Joe Johnson was selected for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, and Horford made the All-First Rookie Team. In the first round of the playoffs, they lost to the top-seeded Boston Celtics in seven games. Following the season, Josh Childress left to play overseas.
