Circuit court is the name of court systems in several common law jurisdictions. The core concept of circuit courts requires judges to travel to different locales in order to ensure wide visibility and understanding of cases in a region. More generally, some modern circuit courts may also refer to a court which merely holds trials for cases of multiple locations in some rotation.
