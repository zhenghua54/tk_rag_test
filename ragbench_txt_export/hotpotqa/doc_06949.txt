The Shoppes at Parma, formerly known as Parmatown Mall, is a shopping mall located in Parma, Ohio, (being renovated to being an outdoor shopping mall, like Crocker Park) approximately 10 mi south of Cleveland. It is located at the southwest corner of State Route 3 and Ridgewood Drive in southern Cuyahoga County. It is anchored by J.C. Penney, Walmart and other stores. The mall opened as a shopping plaza in 1956 and was enclosed in the mid-1960s. Its original anchors were Higbee's (1967) and May Company (1960) Higbee's became Dillard's in 1992, and closed in 2000. A Cleveland Trust Bank branch located next to May Company opened in August, 1960 when the new May Company strip was added. The old Higbee's structure was demolished and replaced with a new Walmart in 2004. May Company became Kaufmann's in 1993 and Kaufmann's became Macy's in 2006. A Kresge also served as a fourth anchor store until it was closed in the early 1980s to make way for an expansion. Parts of the original plaza remain open-air, with Chuck E. Cheese's and Marc's as major tenants. It has about 50+ stores. The mall was renovated in the early 2000s. The mall is currently being renovated to be an outdoor shopping center, with the interior demolished for store fronts.
