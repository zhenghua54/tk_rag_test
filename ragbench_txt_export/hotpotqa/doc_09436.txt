The G56 manual transmission is the only manual transmission currently available in a full-size pickup truck. It is also the only manual transmission being optioned in Class-4 and Class-5 trucks. The transmission uses Mopar ATF+4 transmission fluid. Ram trucks began running this transmission in the 2005 model-year trucks as a mid-year change to phase out the cast-iron 6-speed New Venture Gear 5600 transmission.
