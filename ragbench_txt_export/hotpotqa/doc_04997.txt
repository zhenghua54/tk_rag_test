The College Green of Ohio University is the university's central quadrangle lawn which saw the first academic buildings in the Northwest Territory. The green roughly sits aligned to the cardinal directions, with Manasseh Cutler Hall facing true north. The green, at the heart of the Athens campus, is surrounded by administrative, academic, and library buildings. For most of the nineteenth and twentieth century, it saw small memorials and wartime monuments dedicated in remembrance of the people involved in those centuries' great conflicts.
