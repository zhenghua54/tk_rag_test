The Samarkand clan (alternatively Samarqand) is an Uzbek clan led by Ismoil Jurabekov. The clan is one of two major clans in Uzbekistan; the other, its main rival, is the Tashkent clan. To a lesser extent, the Ferghana clan is also a rival. Former Uzbek President Islam Karimov and current President Shavkat Mirziyoyev come from the Samarkand clan.
