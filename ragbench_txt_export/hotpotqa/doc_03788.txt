The 2007 season was Malmö FF's 96th in existence, their 72nd season in Allsvenskan and their 7th consecutive season in the league. They competed in Allsvenskan where they finished in 9th position and Svenska Cupen where they were knocked out in the third round. The result in Allsvenskan was the club's worst league performance since the 2001 season when they also finished 9th, as a result of this, manager Sören Åkebys contract was not renewed and Roland Nilsson was announced as the new Malmö FF manager in October 2007.
