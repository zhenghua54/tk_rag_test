The Nova Southeastern Sharks baseball program represents Nova Southeastern University in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's NCAA Division II level. The Sharks have a very short history, having less than thirty years of play under their belt; however, the sharks have won the Division II championship in 2016, as well as producing several MLB stars, such as J. D. Martinez of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and Mike Fiers of the Houston Astros. They are coached by Greg Brown.
