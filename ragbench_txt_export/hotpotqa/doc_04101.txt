"I'll Be Here Awhile" is a single by alternative rock band 311. It is the 12th and closing track on their album "From Chaos". Lead singer Nick Hexum originally wrote it when he was twenty, hence the line in the refrain "Twenty years of age, " though Hexum was thirty when he recorded it. He comments on the interview included on the disc of "From Chaos" that he was living a wild and crazy life at that young age.
