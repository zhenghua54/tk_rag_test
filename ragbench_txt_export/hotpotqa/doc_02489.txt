The 7.92×107mm DS was a Polish 7.92 mm anti-tank ammunition designed specifically for use with the karabin przeciwpancerny wz.35 anti-tank rifle. It was based on a standard 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, but was much longer (107 mm as opposed to the 57 mm of Mauser cartridge) and was modified to provide higher muzzle velocity and hence more penetrating power.
