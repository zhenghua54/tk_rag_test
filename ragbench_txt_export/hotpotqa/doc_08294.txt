Dance Dance Dance (ダンス・ダンス・ダンス , Dansu Dansu Dansu ) is the sixth novel by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. First published in 1988, it was translated into English by Alfred Birnbaum in 1994. The book is a sequel to Murakami's novel "A Wild Sheep Chase". In 2001, Murakami said that writing "Dance Dance Dance" had been a healing act after his unexpected fame following the publication of "Norwegian Wood" and that, because of this, he had enjoyed writing "Dance" more than any other.
