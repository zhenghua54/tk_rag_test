"The Vane Sisters" is a short story by Vladimir Nabokov, written in March 1951. It is famous for providing one of the most extreme examples of an unreliable narrator. It was first published in the Winter 1958 issue of "The Hudson Review" and then reprinted in "Encounter" during 1959. The story was included in "Nabokov's Quartet" (1966), "Nabokov's Congeries" (1968; reprinted as "The Portable Nabokov", 1971), "Tyrants Destroyed and Other Stories" (1975), and "The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov" (1995).
