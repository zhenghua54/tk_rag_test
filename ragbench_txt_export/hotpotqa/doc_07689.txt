"FutureSex/LoveSound" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake for his second studio album, "FutureSex/LoveSounds" (2006). It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley and Nate "Danja" Hills. The song was produced following Timberlake's two-year hiatus from the music industry, when he felt "burnt out" after the release of his debut solo album "Justified" in 2002. "FutureSex/LoveSound" incorporates elements of new wave and industrial rock into its production. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with some of them praising its production and others criticizing its simplistic lyrics. Following the release of the album, "FutureSex/LoveSound" peaked at number 13 on the "Billboard" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. It was included on the set list of Timberlake's second worldwide tour FutureSex/LoveShow (2007).
