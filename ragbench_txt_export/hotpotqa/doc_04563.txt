"Hard to Explain" is the first single from New York garage rock band The Strokes (their only previously released material was "The Modern Age" EP). It was released first in the UK and was later released in the US with different album artwork. (The UK version has a photo of two chairs, one red and one black, facing the camera. The chairs appear to be in a diner or restaurant of some sort.) Because this single is the first from their debut LP "Is This It", "Hard to Explain" made the anticipation for the album proper very high, and when "Is This It" did come out it was widely hailed as one of the best of the year. The B-side of this single, "New York City Cops" was omitted from the US version of the album in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center (the chorus to the song contains the lines "New York City cops/They ain't too smart").
