Wyprawa Robinson, was the only season of the Polish version of Expedition Robinson, or Survivor as it is referred to in some countries and it aired in late 2004. The show adapted many elements from the original Swedish version of the show such as the North and South teams. The main difference in this version from most versions was that tribal council only took place every other episode. Due, to the early exits of Marek Neuman and Magdalena "Magda" Śliwko, who were both evacuated due to injuries they sustained, and Łukasz "Ken" Wiewiórski who quit, two member of the north team were eventually forced to swap teams (Wincenty Ołowski and Witold Casetti). When it came time to merge all of the contestants took part in an elimination challenge which Wincenty lost and was eliminated from the game. When it came time for the final three the contestants competed in a challenge in order to determine who would be the final two. Ultimately, it was Katarzyna "Kasia" Drzyżdżyk who won the season over Patrycja Bokiej by a jury vote of 6-1.
