A stolperstein (] from German, literally "stumbling stone", metaphorically a "stumbling block" or a stone to "stumble upon", plural stolpersteine) is a cobblestone-size (10x10 cm ) concrete cube bearing a brass plate inscribed with the name and life dates of victims of Nazi extermination or persecution. The "stolperstein" art project was initiated by the German artist Gunter Demnig in 1992, and is still ongoing. It aims at commemorating individual persons at exactly the last place of residency—or, sometimes, work—which was freely chosen by the person before he or she fell victim to Nazi terror, euthanasia, eugenics, was deported to a concentration or extermination camp, or escaped persecution by emigration or suicide. s of 31 2017 , over 56,000 "stolpersteine" have been laid in 22 European countries, making the "stolperstein" project the world's largest decentralized memorial.
