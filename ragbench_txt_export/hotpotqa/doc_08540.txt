The original Argentine National Anthem (Spanish: "Himno Nacional Argentino" ) was named "Marcha Patriótica " (Patriotic March), later renamed "Canción Patriótica Nacional " (National Patriotic Song), and then "Canción Patriótica " (Patriotic Song). It has been called "Himno Nacional Argentino" since it was published with that name in 1847. Its lyrics were written by the Buenos Aires-born politician Vicente López y Planes and the music was composed by the Spanish musician Blas Parera. The work was adopted as the sole official song on May 11, 1813, three years after the May Revolution; May 11 is therefore Anthem Day in Argentina.
