The Tristan chord is a chord made up of the notes F, B, D♯ , and G♯ . More generally, it can be any chord that consists of these same intervals: augmented fourth, augmented sixth, and augmented ninth above a bass note. It is so named as it is heard in the opening phrase of Richard Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde" as part of the leitmotif relating to Tristan.
