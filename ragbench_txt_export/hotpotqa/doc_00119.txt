Fearless is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The album was released on November 11, 2008, by Big Machine Records. As with her first album, "Taylor Swift", Swift wrote or co-wrote all thirteen tracks on "Fearless". Most of the songs were written as the singer promoted her first album as the opening act for numerous country artists. Due to the unavailability of collaborators on the road, eight songs were written by Swift. Other songs were co-written with Liz Rose, Hillary Lindsey, Colbie Caillat, and John Rich. Swift also made her debut as a record producer, co-producing all songs on the album with Nathan Chapman.
