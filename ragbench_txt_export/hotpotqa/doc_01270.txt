Morita therapy is an ecological, purpose-centered, response-oriented therapy created through case-based research by Shoma Morita, M.D. (1874â€“1938). Morita developed his theory of consciousness and medically-grounded four-stage progressive therapeutic method with as much rigor as his contemporaries, Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Anna Freud, Carl Jung, Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and Wilfred Bion.
