Travelers and Thieves is Blues Traveler's second album, released on A&M Records in 1991. The album was released in two different versions: an album-only version, and an extremely limited two-CD pressing. The bonus disc was called "On Tour Forever". On iTunes the album is listed only as "Travelers" due to the full name being split across two drawings, one on the cover and one inside the CD liner notes.
