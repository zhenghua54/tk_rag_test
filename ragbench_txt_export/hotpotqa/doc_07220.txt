The following is a list of some notable species of the agaric genus "Amanita". This genus contains over 500 named species and varieties, but the list is far from exhaustive. The list follows the classification of subgenera and sections of "Amanita" outline by Corner and Bas; Bas, as used by Tulloss (2007) and modified by Redhead & al. (2016) for "Amanita" subgenus "Amanitina" and Singer for "Amanita" section "Roanokenses". Bolding of the species name and an asterisk (*) following indicates the species is the type species of that section, with a double asterisk (**) indicating the type species of the entire genus. Use of common names follows Tulloss (2007), Holden (2003), Arora (1986), and Lincoff (1981).
