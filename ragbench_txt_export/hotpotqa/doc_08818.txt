Lex Antonia (Latin for "Antonine law", sometimes presented plurally as the leges Antoniae, "Antonine laws") was a law established in ancient Rome in April 44 BC. It was proposed by Mark Antony and passed by the Roman Senate, following the assassination of Julius Caesar. It formally abolished the Dictatorship. It was the second law to do so (the first being passed after the Second Punic War, replacing the Dictatorship with the final decree of the Senate); however, the earlier law had essentially been nullified by the subsequent Dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar.
