Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. ___ (2013) , was a United States Supreme Court case that decided that, in line with "Apprendi v. New Jersey" (2000), all facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to and found true by a jury (not merely determined to be true by a judge's discretion). The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.
