Arcade was an Australian television soap opera shown in 1980 that became one of the biggest flops in the history of Australian television. It aired on Network Ten with the premiere (76-minute) episode shown on Sunday, 20 January 1980. The series then ran five nights a week, Mondays to Fridays, as a 30-minute serial. It was produced solely by Network Ten (as an in-house production) with a start-up budget of almost $1 million.
