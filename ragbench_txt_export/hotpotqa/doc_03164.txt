Murder City is a British crime drama series produced by Granada Television, first broadcast on 18 March 2004 on ITV, that focuses on two mismatched detectives — DI Susan Alembic (Amanda Donohoe) and DS Luke Stone (Kris Marshall) — who scour London solving complex cases. The first series consisted of six episodes. A second and final series of four episodes was subsequently commissioned, which began broadcast on 5 April 2006. Following declining viewing figures, a third series of "Murder City" was not commissioned. BBC America began airing the complete series on August 17, 2006, and it was subsequently released in a Region 1 four-disc DVD box set by Image Entertainment on August 14, 2007.
