The Search is a 2014 French drama film written, directed, produced and co-edited by Michel Hazanavicius and co-produced by Thomas Langmann. The film is a reiteration of the Oscar-winning post-Holocaust drama also called "The Search", directed by Fred Zinnemann, in which a compassionate westerner helps a lost child find what is left of his family amidst the chaotic flood of post-war civilian refugees. In the 1948 film, the backdrop is post-war Berlin; "The Search" (2014) takes place in the "front lines of the Russian invasion of Chechnya" during the first year of the Second Chechen War (1999-2009). In both cases, international aid workers help the families reunite. "The Search" was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.
