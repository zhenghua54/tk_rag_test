The sodium-chloride symporter (also known as Na-Cl cotransporter, abbreviated as NCC or NCCT, or as the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter or TSC for short) is a cotransporter in the kidney which has the function of reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. It is a member of the SLC12 cotransporter family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters. In humans, it is encoded by the gene "SLC12A3" (solute carrier family 12 member 3) located in 16q13.
