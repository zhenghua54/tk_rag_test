The Second Battle of Bull Run or Battle of Second Manassas was fought August 28â€“30, 1862 in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia Campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run (or "First Manassas") fought on July 21, 1861 on the same ground.
