Purandara Dāsa (Kannada: ಪುರಂದರ ದಾಸ ) (1484–1564) was a Haridasa (a devotee - servant of Lord Hari (Vishnu)), great devotee of Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) and a saint. He was a disciple of the celebrated Madhwa philosopher-saint Sri Vyasatirtha, and a contemporary of yet another great Haridasa, Kanakadasa. His Guru, Sri Vyasatirtha himself glorified Purandara Dasa in a song thus: "Dāsarendare purandara dāsarayya" (ದಾಸರೆಂದರೆ ಪುರಂದರ ದಾಸರಯ್ಯ). Purandara Dasa was a composer, singer and one of the chief founding-proponents of the South Indian classical music (Carnatic Music). In honor of his significant and legendary contributions to Carnatic Music, he is widely referred to as the "Pitamaha" ("lit", "father" or the "grandfather") of Carnatic Music. He is respected as an "avatara" (incarnation) of the great sage Narada (a celestial being who is also a singer).
