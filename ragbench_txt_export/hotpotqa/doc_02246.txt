Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds: Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's motion picture "Inglourious Basterds". It was originally released on August 18, 2009. The soundtrack uses a variety of music genres, including spaghetti western soundtrack excerpts, R&B and a David Bowie song from the 1982 remake of "Cat People." "The Man with the Big Sombrero", a song from the 1943 screwball comedy "Hi Diddle Diddle", was rerecorded in French for the movie. This is the first soundtrack for a Quentin Tarantino film not to feature dialogue excerpts. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, but lost to the "Slumdog Millionaire" soundtrack.
