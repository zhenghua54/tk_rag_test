Live in L.A. is a selection of the best live recordings of concerts performed by Joe Cocker in 1972 with The Chris Stainton Band. It includes several live versions of Cocker's classics such as "High Time We Went" and "Hitchcock Railway", as well as new tracks like "Love the One You're With" and "Didn't You Know You've Got to Cry Sometime", "Early in the Mornin'" and "What Kind of Man are You". The electricity of live performance, which is the very essence of Joe Cocker, is captured on this album, providing a natural companion to his previous live classic "Mad Dogs and Englishmen".
