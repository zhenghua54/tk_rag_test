The 1996–97 NBA season was the 29th season for the Phoenix Suns in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Suns acquired Sam Cassell and Robert Horry from the Houston Rockets, and signed free agent Rex Chapman. However, the team struggled losing their first 13 games of the season. After an 0–8 start, coach Cotton Fitzsimmons was replaced by former Suns guard Danny Ainge, who led the team to a 40–34 finish, along the way they were many in-season moves such as trading Cassell, second-year star Michael Finley and A. C. Green, to the Dallas Mavericks for future-superstar Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer and Tony Dumas, and sending Horry along with Joe Kleine, to the Los Angeles Lakers for former Suns forward Cedric Ceballos and Rumeal Robinson.
