Skellerup Glacier ( ) is a glacier flowing west north west between All-Blacks Nunataks and Wilhoite Nunataks, west of the Churchill Mountains. Named in honor of P. J. Skellerup, who sponsored the Antarctic wing at Canterbury Museum. He is particularly keen on scientific research and donated money to build a specialist Antarctic Library at the Museum. He also donated a large collection of Antarctic materials to the Museum, including some very old and rare Antarctic manuscripts. He remains interested in the collection and has continued his sponsorship and donations over 30+ years.
