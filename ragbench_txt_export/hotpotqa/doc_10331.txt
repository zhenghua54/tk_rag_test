Chimpanzees (or chimps) are the species of the great apes in the genus Pan, consisting of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. Together with gorillas, they are the only great apes that are currently restricted in their range to Africa. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, both chimpanzees and bonobos are currently found in the Congo jungle.
