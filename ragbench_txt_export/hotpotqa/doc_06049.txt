U.S. Route 80 (US 80) also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway was a major transcontinental highway which existed in the U.S. state of Arizona from November 11, 1926, to October 6, 1989. At its peak, US 80 traveled from the California border in Yuma to the New Mexico state line near Lordsburg. Locals often used US 80 to reach the beaches around San Diego during the hot Arizona summers. US 80 was a particularly long highway, reaching almost 500 mi long within the state of Arizona alone. With the advent of the Interstate Highway System, Interstate 10 and Interstate 8 both replaced US 80 within the state. US 80 was removed from Arizona in 1989; the remainder of it now being State Route 80.
