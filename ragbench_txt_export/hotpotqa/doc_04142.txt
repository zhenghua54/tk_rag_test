"If I Fell" is a song by English rock band the Beatles which first appeared in 1964 on the album "A Hard Day's Night" in the United Kingdom and on the North American album "Something New". It was credited to Lennon–McCartney, but John Lennon often stated that he wrote it. "That's my first attempt at a ballad proper...It shows that I wrote sentimental love ballads way back when", Lennon stated in his 1980 "Playboy" interview. However, Paul McCartney stated that he contributed to the song: “We wrote ‘If I Fell’ together.”
