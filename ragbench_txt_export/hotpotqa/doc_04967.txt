Mârouf, savetier du Caire ("Marouf, Cobbler of Cairo") is an "opéra comique" by the French composer Henri Rabaud. The libretto, by Lucien Nepoty, is based on a tale from the "Arabian Nights". "Mârouf" was first performed at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, on 15 May 1914. The premiere was a great success and "Mârouf" became Rabaud's most popular opera. The score makes great use of oriental colour. The United States premiere of the opera was given at the Metropolitan Opera on December 19, 1917, with Giuseppe De Luca in the title role, Frances Alda as Princess Saamcheddine, and Pierre Monteux conducting. The opera was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 2013 in a production by Jérôme Deschamps, with Jean-Sébastien Bou in the title role, conducted by Alain Altinoglu.
