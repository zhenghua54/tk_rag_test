"Jupiter (Swallow the Moon)" is a song by Jewel that was released in 1999 as a single from the album "Spirit", following the second single "Down So Long". The single release saw an entirely new version. Jewel re-recorded vocals and the music for a more pop release to the public, even the title of the song was changed from "Jupiter" to "Jupiter (Swallow the Moon)". A commercial single was issued within the U.S. for the song (and internationally). The single is credited as the "radio version".
