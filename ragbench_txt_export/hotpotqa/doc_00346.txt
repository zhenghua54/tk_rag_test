The West Lancashire derby (sometimes also known as the "M55 derby") is a local rivalry in English football between Lancashire clubs Blackpool and Preston North End. The derby has taken place across all three tiers of the Football League, but not yet in the Premier League. Blackpool were promoted to the Premier League in 2010; Preston North End have yet to reach it. They have not met in the League since February 2010. In 2015, Preston moved above Blackpool in the Football League pyramid for the first time since 2004–05, when they were in the Championship and Blackpool were in League One. This will be repeated for the 2015–16 campaign.
