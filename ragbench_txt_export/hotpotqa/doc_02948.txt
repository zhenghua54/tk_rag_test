"Bad Reputation" is the seventeenth episode of the American television series, "Glee". The episode premiered on the Fox network on May 4, 2010. It was directed by Elodie Keene, and written by series creator Ian Brennan. In "Bad Reputation", cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is publicly ridiculed when a video of her dancing to Olivia Newton-John's "Physical" is posted on YouTube. A salacious list about members of the glee club circulates the school, leading certain members to try to earn themselves a bad reputation. Newton-John guest-stars as herself in the episode, and Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in a recurring role. Following their romance in the episode "Mash-Up", club members Rachel (Lea Michele) and Puck (Mark Salling) are reunited, a decision made by the producers due to the unexpected popularity of the pairing.
