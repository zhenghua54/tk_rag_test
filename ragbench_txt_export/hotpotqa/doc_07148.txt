The Norwoodâ€“Port Adelaide rivalry is Australian rules football's oldest and one of its most intense rivalries. It is contested between the Norwood Football Club and the Port Adelaide Football Club. Together Port Adelaide (36) and Norwood (30) have won 66 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) premierships since the founding of the competition in 1878. As the SANFL competition has been suspended due to war, only 132 seasons have been played, therefore together Norwood and Port Adelaide have won exactly half of all SANFL premierships awarded. The two clubs have met in finals 50 times with 17 of those grand finals including 2 war-time grand finals.
