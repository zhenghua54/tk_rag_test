The Purple Land is a novel set in 19th century Uruguay by William Henry Hudson, first published in 1885 under the title "The Purple Land that England Lost". Initially a commercial and critical failure, it was reissued in 1904 with the full title "The Purple Land, Being One Richard Lamb's Adventures in the Banda Orient√°l, in South America, as told by Himself". Towards the end of the novel, the narrator explains the title, "I will call my book "The Purple Land." For what more suitable name can one find for a country so stained with the blood of her children?"
