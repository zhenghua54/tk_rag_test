The United States presidential election of 1996 was the 53rd quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 5, 1996. The Democratic national ticket was led by incumbent President Bill Clinton, and his running mate, incumbent Vice President Al Gore. The Republican nominee for President was Bob Dole, the former Republican Leader of the United States Senate and long-time Senator from Kansas who was previously the vice-presidential running mate of President Gerald Ford in 1976, following Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's retirement from politics that year. Dole's running mate for Vice President was Jack Kemp, a former NFL football player and the Housing Secretary under George H. W. Bush. Businessman Ross Perot ran as candidate for the Reform Party with economist Pat Choate as his running mate; he received less media attention and was excluded from the presidential debates and, while still obtaining substantial results for a third-party candidate, by U.S. standards, did not renew his success of the 1992 election. Turnout was registered at 49.0%, the lowest for a presidential election since 1924.
