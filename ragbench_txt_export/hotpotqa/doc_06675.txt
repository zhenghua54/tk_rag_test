Deebing Heights is a semi-rural suburb located in Queensland, Australia. The area that is now Deebing Heights has been an important settlement since Queensland's early colonial history, but was only gazetted as a locality in 2000 and then a suburb in 2004, previously being part of Purga. It is home of the heritage listed Deebing Creek Mission Aboriginal Reserve located at the southern end of Grampian Drive which acted as a home to the Ugarapul/yuggera tribe until its closing in 1915. Development was slow to begin in Deebing Heights with Paradise Heights, a premium acreage estate only beginning development in the mid-1990s. However, with development planned over the entire suburb, it has a projected population of 25,000 people by 2020.
