NHL 11 is an ice hockey video game, which celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the "NHL" series. The game was developed by EA Canada, published by EA Sports, and released in North America on September 7, 2010, with the game releasing in all other regions within two weeks. The game features a physics-based game engine, which replaced the old animation-based system, and was touted by "NHL 11" producer, Sean Ramjagsingh, as "the biggest change in "NHL 11"". Other significant changes include broken sticks, which means the stick may now break when the player shoots. "NHL 11" does not use official International Ice Hockey Federation jerseys, as the game doesn't have the IIHF license. The cover of "NHL 11" features Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, who helped the team win their first Stanley Cup title in 49 years in 2010.
