"Lemon" is a song by Irish rock band U2, and the fourth track from their 1993 album, "Zooropa". It was released as the album's second single in September 1993. Inspired by old video footage of Bono's late mother, the lyrics describe an attempt to preserve memory through film. More than any previous U2 song, "Lemon" showcases Bono's falsetto skills, aided by atmospheric vocals from the Edge and Brian Eno. The song has been described as futuristic German disco. The album version is one of U2's longest songs.
