Hilliard's Beer is a brewery in Seattle, Washington, US. It opened on October 7, 2011 in a building constructed in 1947 within the Ballard neighborhood. The company is the namesake of Ryan Hilliard, a self-described home brewer gone pro. To open the brewery, Hilliard stepped away from a career as a flight instructor. Hilliard's was one of the first craft breweries in Washington to focus on producing beer in aluminum cans. Packaging beer in cans was an important part of the original Hilliard's Beer business plan: better for the beer's longevity, better for business operation sustainability and better for the environment. The brewing philosophy of Hilliard's Beer is 'keep it simple' with a focus on quality ingredients. This philosophy is displayed in their cans' design, created by Seattle's own design company, Mint. Hilliard's Beer is described as a "retro cool beer brand that embraces good design".
