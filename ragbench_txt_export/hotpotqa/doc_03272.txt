Beaumont is a northside suburb of Dublin city, Ireland, bordered by Donnycarney, Santry and Artane. It lies within the postal district Dublin 9. Beaumont is also a parish in the Fingal South East deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. The name is derived from the French for "beautiful mount" ( named by Olivia Whitemore and Arthur Guinness in 1764) as the parish is located atop an ascent from Fairview. Its clean air and views across Dublin to the Wicklow mountains inspired the name. From 1764 Olivia Whitmore and Arthur Guinness made their new family home in Beaumont House. The house is a protected structure and can be visited today.
