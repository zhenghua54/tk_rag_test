The Leipzig Salient was a German defensive position built in 1915 on the Somme in France, during the First World War, opposite the village of Authuille which contained the Leipzig Redoubt on its west face. The position was to the south-west of the later Thiepval Memorial, north-east of the La Boisselle–Authuille and Thiepval–Aveluy crossroads. The German front line bulged around a quarry, which the Germans fortified and enclosed with Hindenburg Trench, which had been dug further back across the chord of the salient. The "Wundtwerk" Redoubt (Wonderwork to the British), lay beyond on a reverse slope. Nab Valley lay on the east side, Thiepval was to the north, with the fortified Mouquet Farm and the village of Pozières to the north-west.
