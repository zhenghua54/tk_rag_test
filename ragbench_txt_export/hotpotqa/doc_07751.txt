Typhlonarke is a genus of sleeper ray in the family Narkidae, containing two poorly known species. The group is known for producing electric shocks for defense. Both species are deep-sea rays endemic to the waters off New Zealand. They are not to be confused with the blind electric rays of the genus "Benthobatis".
