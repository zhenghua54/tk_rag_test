The East Wing is a part of the White House Complex. It is a two-story structure east of the White House Executive Residence, the home of the President of the United States. While the West Wing generally serves the president's executive office staff, the East Wing serves as office space for the First Lady and her staff, including the White House Social Secretary, White House Graphics and Calligraphy Office and correspondence staff. The East Wing also includes the visitors' entrance, and the East Colonnade, a corridor connecting the body of the East Wing to the residence. Along the corridor is also the White House theater, also called the Family theater. Social visitors to the White House usually enter through the East Wing.
