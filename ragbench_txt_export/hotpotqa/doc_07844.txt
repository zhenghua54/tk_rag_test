The Melbourne Boomers are an Australian professional women's basketball club based in Melbourne, Victoria. It was established in 1969 and, after missing out in 1983, was accepted into the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) in 1984 under the name of Bulleen Boomers, named after the suburb of the same name. Applications were prepared and presented by Jan Collinson, who remained the club’s delegate to the League for many years with her efforts being rewarded with a Life Membership to the League in 2001. Other workers crucial to Bulleen’s entry in the WNBL in the club’s formative years were Janice McLeod, Gary Turner and John Barker.
