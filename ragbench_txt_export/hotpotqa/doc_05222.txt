Nandrolone is an injected anabolicâ€“androgenic steroid (AAS) which is used medically in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate (brand name Deca-Durabolin) and nandrolone phenylpropionate (brand name Durabolin). They are not active by mouth, and must be administered via intramuscular injection. When administered in this way, they form a depot from which they are slowly released, and hence have a long duration of action. Nandrolone esters are prodrugs, and are rapidly hydrolyzed into nandrolone once in the circulation.
