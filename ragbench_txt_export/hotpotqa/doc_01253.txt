Citra was a grapefruit-flavored soft drink released into the U.S. market in 1996 by The Coca-Cola Company around the same time as Surge, another citrus-flavored soft drink marketed by Coca-Cola (although Surge contained caffeine while Citra was caffeine-free). Citra had a very similar flavor to Fresca, especially the version of Fresca sold in Latin America, which is sweetened with sucrose (table sugar) rather than aspartame as in the American version of Fresca. It also had a flavor similar flavor to Squirt, except that Squirt contains a trace of orange or tangerine flavoring. Citra also had a very similar flavor to that of Canfield's 50/50.
