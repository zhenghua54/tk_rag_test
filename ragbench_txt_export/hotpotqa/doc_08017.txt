The Walton family is an American family whose collective fortune makes them among the richest families in the world. The majority of their wealth derives from the heritage of Bud and Sam Walton, who were the co-founders of the world's largest retailer, Walmart. The three most prominent living members (Jim, Rob and Alice) have consistently been in the top ten of the "Forbes" 400 since 2001, as were John ( 2005) and Helen (d. 2007) prior to their deaths. Christy Walton took her husband John's place after his death.
