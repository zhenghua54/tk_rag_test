The Yellow River Piano Concerto () is a piano concerto arranged by a collaboration between musicians including Yin Chengzong and Chu Wanghua, and based on the "Yellow River Cantata" by composer Xian Xinghai. Since its politicised premiere in 1969 during the Cultural Revolution, the Concerto has become popular in China and amongst overseas Chinese nationalists. It is noted for a difficult solo part. This piano concerto and the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto, which tells the story of the Butterfly Lovers, are two internationally known Chinese works that combine Western music methodology with Chinese source materials.
