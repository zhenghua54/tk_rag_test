The National Association for Public Health Policy was founded in 1980 by a group of past-presidents of the American Public Health Association led by Milton Terris, MD, MPH. The purpose of the Association is “to improve the health of the people of the United States by helping to develop health policy, formulating and initiating legislation to implement such policy, and supporting measures to strengthen the public health services.” It sponsors the "Journal of Public Health Policy" and the online journal "NAPHP.ORG".
