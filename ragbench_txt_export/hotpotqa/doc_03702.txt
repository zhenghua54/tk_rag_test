The White Stripes were an American rock duo formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002, as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums "White Blood Cells" and "Elephant" drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom, with the single "Seven Nation Army" and its guitar line becoming their signature song. The band recorded two more albums, "Get Behind Me Satan" in 2005 and "Icky Thump" in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.
