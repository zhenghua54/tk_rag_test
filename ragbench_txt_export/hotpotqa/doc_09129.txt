The Hood Museum of Art is a museum in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Dating back to 1772, the museum is owned and operated by Dartmouth College. The current building, designed by Charles Willard Moore and Chad Floyd, opened in the fall of 1985. It houses both permanent collections and visiting exhibitions. The collection encompasses important holdings of American, Native American, European, African, and Melanesian art, including a significant collection of indigenous Australian contemporary art and a major archive of photojournalism. Among the collection's greatest treasures are Assyrian reliefs and the fresco mural cycle "The Epic of American Civilization", by Jos√© Clemente Orozco. (The murals are located in nearby Baker Memorial Library.)
