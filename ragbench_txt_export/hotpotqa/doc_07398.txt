Hans Ødegaard (30 May 1876 – 1 March 1943) was a Norwegian painter. He was born in Norderhov. He studied painting and drawing with Brynjulf Bergslien, Kristian Zahrtmann and Johan Nordhagen. Among his paintings at the National Gallery of Norway are "Skraphandel i Vaterland " from 1903, and "Fra Tvedestrand" from 1919. He was responsible for the presentation of elder Norwegian art at the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition at Frogner in Kristiania. The presentation of painters such as Lars Hertervig, Mathias Stoltenberg, Peder Balke and Johannes Flintoe gave these artists a more prominent position in the history of Norwegian art.
