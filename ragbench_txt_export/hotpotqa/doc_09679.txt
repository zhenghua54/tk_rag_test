The Ultradrive is a 4-speed automatic transmission from Chrysler Corporation. It was produced starting in 1989. It was originally paired primarily with the Mitsubishi 3.0 (6G72) engine in vehicles with transverse engines. In 1990, it was expanded to work with the Chrysler 3.3 & 3.8 V6 engines in Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager, Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Dynasty & Chrysler New Yorker. The Ultradrive was produced at Kokomo Transmission in Kokomo, Indiana, a plant which still makes front wheel drive Chrysler automatic transmissions.
