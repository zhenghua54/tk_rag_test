Linux Format was the UK's first Linux-specific magazine, and as of 2013 was the best-selling Linux title in the UK. It is also exported to many countries worldwide. It is published by Future plc (which produces "PC Plus", ".net" and many other computer magazines). Linux Format is commonly abbreviated to LXF, and issues are referred to with LXF as a prefix followed by the issue number (for example LXF102 refers to the 102nd issue).
