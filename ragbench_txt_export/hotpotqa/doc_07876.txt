Auburn is an Antebellum mansion in Duncan Park in Natchez, Mississippi. It was designed and constructed by Levi Weeks in 1812, and was the first building to exhibit Greek Revival order in the town. Its prominent two-story Greek portico served as a model for the subsequent architectural development of local mansions. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974 and a Mississippi Landmark in 1984.
