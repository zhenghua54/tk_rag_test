The Parc des Buttes-Chaumont (] ) is a public park situated in northeastern Paris, in the 19th arrondissement. Occupying 24.7 ha , it is the fifth-largest park in Paris, after the Bois de Vincennes, the Bois de Boulogne, the Parc de la Villette, and the Tuileries Garden. It was opened in 1867, late in the regime of Emperor Napoleon III, and was built by Jean-Charles Alphand, who created all the major parks of Napoleon III. The park has 5.5 km of roads and 2.2 km of paths. The most famous feature of the park is the "Temple de la Sibylle", inspired by the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy, perched at the top of a cliff fifty metres above the waters of the artificial lake.
