"The Twilight Zone" is the third track on Rush's album "2112". It was the last track written and recorded for the album. It was the first single to be released from "2112". As with most Rush songs, the lyrics are written by Neil Peart, and the music by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson. It is based on two episodes of "The Twilight Zone": "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?" (first verse) and "Stopover in a Quiet Town" (second verse). Rush had dedicated their previous album, "Caress of Steel", to the memory of "The Twilight Zone" creator Rod Serling.
