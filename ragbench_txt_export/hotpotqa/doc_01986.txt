October Sky (originally published as Rocket Boys) is the first memoir in a series of three, by Homer Hickam, Jr. It is a story of growing up in a mining town, and a boy's pursuit of amateur rocketry in a coal mining town. It won the W.D. Weatherford Award in 1998, the year of its release. Today, it is one of the most often picked community/library reads in the United States. It is also studied in many school systems around the world. "October Sky" was followed by "The Coalwood Way" (2000) and "Sky of Stone" (2002).
