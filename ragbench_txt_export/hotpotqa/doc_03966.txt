Storyland was a childrenâ€™s theme park located northwest of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, near the town of Renfrew in Horton Township featuring depictions of classic fairy tale scenes. The park featured a mini-golf course, a small water park, live performers, playgrounds, small rides, and staff dressed as fairy tale characters. It is near the Champlain Lookout in Brown's Bay, where Samuel de Champlain made land. In 1953 a large rock was found in the area bearing a chiselled inscription "Champlain Juin 2, 1613" however the authenticity of the inscription has been brought into question by the date format. The Champlain Lookout was a part of the landscape long before Storyland was founded. The park closed after the 2011 season and is currently listed for sale.
