White Noise is a 2005 supernatural horror thriller film, directed by Geoffrey Sax. The title refers to electronic voice phenomena (EVP), where voices, which some believe to be from the "other side", can be heard on audio recordings. The film is not related to the postmodern novel "White Noise" by Don DeLillo.
