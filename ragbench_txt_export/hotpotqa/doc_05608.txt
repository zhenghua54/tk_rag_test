Inamorata is the 18th album by the country rock band Poco. Featuring guest spots by former members Timothy B. Schmitt, Richie Furay and George Grantham (the only member missing from the classic years line up was Jim Messina), this would be the last album that the band would record for Atlantic Records. After this the original line up (Richie Furay, Rusty Young, Jim Messina, Randy Meisner and George Grantham) would reform for the 1989 release "Legacy".
