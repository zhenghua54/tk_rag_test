The Culture of Disbelief (ISBNÂ  ) is a 1994 book by Stephen L. Carter. In it, he holds that religion in the United States is trivialized by American law and politics, and that those with a strong religious faith are forced to bend to meet the viewpoint of a "public faith" which is largely faithless. Carter argues that there is a place for faith in public life, while still adhering to the separation of church and state.
