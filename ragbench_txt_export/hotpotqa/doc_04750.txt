HSBC Main Building () is a headquarters building of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is today a wholly owned subsidiary of London-based HSBC Holdings. It is located along the southern side of Statue Square near the location of the old City Hall, Hong Kong (built in 1869, demolished in 1933). The previous HSBC building was built in 1935 and pulled down to make way for the current building. The address remains as 1 Queen's Road Central (the north facing side of the building was served by Des Voeux Road, which was seashore, making Queen's Road was the main entrance, in contrast to modern day that usually accessed the bank from Des Voeux Road). The building can be reached from Exit K of Central MTR Station and facing Statue Square.
