A panel show or panel game is a radio or television game show in which a panel of celebrities participates. Participants may compete with each other, such as on "The News Quiz"; facilitate play by non-celebrity contestants, such as on "Match Game"/"Blankety Blank"; or do both, such as on "Wait Wait Don't Tell Me". The genre can be traced to 1938, when "Information Please" debuted on U.S. radio. The earliest known television panel show is "Play the Game", a charades show in 1946. The modern trend of comedy panel shows can find early roots with "Stop Me If You've Heard This One" in 1939 and "Can You Top This?" in 1940. While panel shows were more popular in the past in the U.S., they are still very common in the United Kingdom.
