Nghi Son Refinery is the second planned oil refinery in Vietnam. It would be located about 200 km south of Hanoi in Tinh Gia District of Thanh Hóa Province. Site-clearing for the project broke ground in 2008. Construction began on 23 October 2013, and refinery operations are targeted for 2017. Planned capacity is 200000 oilbbl/d , slightly greater than that of Vietnam's first Dung Quat refinery. The site-clearing phase entails the resettlement of 350 households with 1,500 people and the surface leveling of the area.
