The pont de Grenelle is a bridge in Paris, France, that crosses the Seine river. It connects the city's 15th and 16th arrondissements, and passes through the ÃŽle aux Cygnes. Constructed of steel, it is a girder bridge. The current bridge was constructed in 1966, replacing an earlier bridge that had stood since 1873. The bridge passes behind a replica of the Statue of Liberty.
