The Øresund or Öresund Region (Danish: "Øresundsregionen" ; Swedish: "Öresundsregionen" ] ) is a transnational metropolitan area in northern Europe, centred around the Øresund strait and the two cities which lie on either side, Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmö, Sweden. The region is connected by the Øresund Bridge, which spans the strait at its southern end, and the HH Ferry route between Elsinore, Denmark (Danish: "Helsingør") and Helsingborg, Sweden at the narrowest point of the strait.
