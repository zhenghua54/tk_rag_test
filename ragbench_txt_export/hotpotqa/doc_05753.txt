Retrospective is a 2-disc compilation of Red House Painters' songs from the band's 4AD era. The compilation was released in July 1999. Disc one is a collection of definitive Red House Painters tracks culled from their debut album "Down Colorful Hill" through 1995's "Ocean Beach", as picked by 4AD label owner Ivo Watts-Russell. Disc two, subtitled "Demos, Outtakes, Live (1989-1995)", is a collection of unreleased demos and live recordings from their 4AD years. The essay inside the booklet was written by Rob O'Condor in April 1999. A working title for this collection was "Red Perspective".
