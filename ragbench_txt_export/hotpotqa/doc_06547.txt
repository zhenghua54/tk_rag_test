Made of Steel is a BBC Books original novella written by Terrance Dicks and based on the long-running British science fiction television series "Doctor Who". It features the Tenth Doctor and Martha. This paperback is part of the Quick Reads Initiative sponsored by the UK government, to encourage literacy. It has a similar look to BBC Books' other new series adventures, except for its much shorter word count, being a paperback and not being numbered as part of the same series. To date it is the one of only five novels based upon the revived series that have not been published in hardcover: the first, "I am a Dalek", was published in May 2006; the third, "Revenge of the Judoon", was published in March 2008; the fourth, "The Sontaran Games", was published in February 2009; and the fifth, "Code of the Krillitanes", was published in March 2010. These four books are also part of the Quick Reads Initiative.
