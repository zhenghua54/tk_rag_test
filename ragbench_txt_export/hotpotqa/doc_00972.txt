Chinese ritual mastery traditions, also referred to as ritual teachings (, sometimes rendered as "Faism"), or Folk Taoism (), or also Red Taoism (mostly in east China and Taiwan), constitute a large group of Chinese orders of ritual officers who operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside the institutions of official Taoism. The "masters of rites", the "fashi" (法師), are also known in east China as "hongtou daoshi" (紅頭道士), meaning "redhead" or "redhat" "daoshi" ("masters of the Tao"), contrasting with the "wutou daoshi" (烏頭道士), "blackhead" or "blackhat" priests, of Zhengyi Taoism who were historically ordained by the Celestial Master.
