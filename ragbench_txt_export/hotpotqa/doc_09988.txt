The New York Daily News was a daily New York City newspaper from 1855 to 1906, unrelated to the present-day "Daily News" founded in 1919. Founded in the 1850s, it flourished under the stewardship of Benjamin Wood, becoming one of the highest circulation papers in the United States. It was notable for its racist and pro-Confederate views. The paper faltered after Wood's death in 1900, and folded in December 1906.
