Hatzi Hinam or Hetzi Hinam (Hebrew: חצי חינם‎ ‎ , "lit." half-free, from Hebrew: בחצי חינם‎ ‎ , "very cheaply") is a supermarket chain in Israel. Founded in the early 1990s, the regional independent supermarket chain is headquartered in Holon, and has seven stores in the Gush Dan area. Hatzi Hinam is the fourth largest supermarket chain in Israel, with a market share of over 5% but has significantly fewer stores than the two major Israeli chains. In 2004, the company had an estimated NIS1.1 billion in sales and was confirmed the largest independent supermarket chain. Cousins Zaki Shalom and Mordechai Kuperly share ownership (67%/33%) of the chain.
