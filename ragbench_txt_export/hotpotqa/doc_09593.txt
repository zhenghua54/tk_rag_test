The River Sessions is a live album by Scottish folk musician Bert Jansch, released in 2004. The CD contains a track-by-track commentary (state to be done by Bert Jansch). It's a recording of a solo Bert Jansch concert, from City Hall in Glasgow, on November 18, 1974. In 1973, Bert Jansch left Pentangle and the band split. He returned to a solo career and released in a group setting "L.A. Turnaround" in September 1974. Eight of the fourteen tracks on this live album come from that LP. This is the unique recording available on CD of a live solo rendition of the tracks.
