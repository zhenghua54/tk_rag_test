The term child actor or child actress is generally applied to a child acting on stage or in motion pictures or television, but also to an adult who began his or her acting career as a child; to avoid confusion, the latter is also called a "former child actor". Closely associated is teenage actor or teen actor, an actor who reached popularity as a teenager.
