The Prime Minister of Armenia is the head of government and most senior minister within the Armenian government, and is required by the constitution to "oversee the Government's regular activities and coordinate the work of the Ministers." The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of Armenia, but can be removed by a vote of no confidence in Parliament. The office of President is generally considered to be more powerful than the office of Prime Minister. In constitutional referendum held in 2015, citizens voted in favor of transferring Armenia into a parliamentary republic. It will be fully introduced in 2018. The office of President will become ceremonial post and Prime Minister's office will be the most powerful in the country.
