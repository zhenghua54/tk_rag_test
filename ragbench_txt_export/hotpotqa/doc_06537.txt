Hank the Cowdog is a long running, ongoing series of children's books written by John R. Erickson and illustrated by Gerald L. Holmes. The books follow Hank, a dog that views himself as the "Head of Ranch Security". In each book Hank and other characters must deal with several events, issues and mysteries that occur at their Texas Panhandle home, the M-Cross Ranch, which is located in Ochiltree County. The series began in 1982, with a couple of short stories about Hank and his friends; since then, 66 printed books and seven audio-only books have been published. "Hank the Cowdog" was previously published via Maverick Books, with Puffin Books holding the current American publishing rights in English. Each book features songs that Erickson performs on the audiobook editions. The series has received awards and critical acclaim, and the books have sold more than 8 million copies worldwide. It has been published in several languages including Spanish. In the 1980s, the first book was adapted into an animated segment for "CBS Storybreak".
