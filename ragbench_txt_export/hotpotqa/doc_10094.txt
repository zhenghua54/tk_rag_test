The auxiliary Interstate Highways (also called three-digit Interstate Highways) are a supplemental subset of the freeways within the Interstate Highway System of the United States. Similar to the mainline Interstate Highways, these highways also meet all Interstate Highway Standards (with rare exceptions), they receive the same percentage of federal funding (90%), and they comply with other federal standards.
