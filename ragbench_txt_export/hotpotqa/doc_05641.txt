Blackwater Castle (Castle Widenham) is a privately owned estate located in the village of Castletownroche between the towns of Mallow and Fermoy in North Cork, Ireland, and since 2005 is available to rent as a private hire venue for castle weddings and private parties along with castle rentals for vacations. The castle comprises one of the oldest occupied castles in Ireland as parts of the residential section date back to the early 15th century while the castle structure itself dates back to the 12th century. A round tower on the eastern end of the Castle dating from the late 12th century is still standing although no longer accessible. The castle was constructed on the ancient fortress of Dun Cruadha, an inland promontory fort dating back to the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age, while the site itself was first occupied back in the Mesolithic age (circa 9,000 years ago) as evidenced by the flint scatter found at Kilcummer and the caves on the south bank of the River Awbeg making this site one of the earliest known settlements in Ireland.
