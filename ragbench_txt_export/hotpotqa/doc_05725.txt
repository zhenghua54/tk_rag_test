Message to Love (directed and produced by Murray Lerner) is a feature documentary film of the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. The film unsparingly, often comically depicts the myriad problems associated with the famously chaotic festival—the main program of which was held on August 26–30, 1970—including gate-crashing, numerous crowd incursions onto the stage, Kris Kristofferson being booed offstage, and head promoter Rikki Farr's rants against the audience, which only intensified as the situation deteriorated: "We put this festival on, you bastards, with a lot of love! We worked for "one year" for you "pigs!" And you wanna break our walls down and you wanna destroy it? Well you go to "hell!"" This and two other brief dialogue extracts from the film were later sampled in the Oasis track "Fuckin' in the Bushes", from the album "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants".
