The Havanese, a breed of Bichon type, is the national dog of Cuba, developed from the now extinct "Blanquito de la Habana" ("little white dog of Havana"). The "Blanquito" descended from the also now extinct Bichon Tenerife. It is believed that the Blanquito was eventually cross-bred with other Bichon types, including the Poodle, to create what is now known as the Havanese. Sometimes referred to as "Havana Silk Dogs", this was originally another name for the "Blanquito de la Habana".
