"How Do You Sleep?" is a song by English musician John Lennon from his 1971 album "Imagine". The song makes angry and scathing remarks aimed at his former Beatles bandmate and songwriting partner, Paul McCartney. Lennon wrote the song in response to what he perceived as personal slights by McCartney on the latter's "Ram" album. The track includes a slide guitar solo played by George Harrison, also a former member of the Beatles.
