"The Fisherman and His Wife" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale no. 19. It is Aarne–Thompson type 555, the fisherman and his wife. Its theme was used in "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish", an 1833 poem by Aleksandr Pushkin. Virginia Woolf has her character Mrs. Ramsey in "To the Lighthouse" read a version of the story to her son, James. Günter Grass's 1977 novel, "The Flounder," is loosely based on the fairy tale, as are Emanuele Luzzati's version, "Punch and the Magic Fish," and Ursula LeGuin's novel "The Lathe of Heaven".
