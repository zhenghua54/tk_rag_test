In May 2017, the UFC announced White would hold "Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series" weekly on UFC Fight Pass. As with the earlier web series "Looking for a Fight", the goal of the series is for White to scout talent for the UFC. Similar to The Ultimate Fighter none of the fighters involved will have existing UFC contracts. Licensed separately from the UFC with Dana White applying for a promoter's licence, it was stated ahead of the license being approved that â€œthis is not the UFC, this is not the UFC brand, but instead a promotion that will allow up and coming fighters the chance to showcase their talents in hopes that one day they may compete in the UFC."
