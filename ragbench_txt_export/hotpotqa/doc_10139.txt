"Dungeons & Dragons" retro-clones are fantasy role-playing games that seek to emulate editions of "Dungeons & Dragons" ("D&D") no longer supported by Wizards of the Coast. They are mostly made possible by the terms of the Open Game License and System Reference Document, which allows the use of much of the proprietary terminology of "D&D" that might otherwise collectively constitute a copyright infringement. While these rules lack the name "D&D" or any of the associated trademarks, their intent is to have a playable experience similar to those older editions.
