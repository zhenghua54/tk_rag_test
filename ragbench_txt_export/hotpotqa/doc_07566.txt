The Uruguayan Clásico (Spanish: "Clásico del fútbol uruguayo") is the most important rivalry in Uruguayan football and one of the best of the American continent. It is contested between the two most popular football clubs in Uruguay, Club Nacional de Football and Club Atlético Peñarol (formerly CURCC), both based in Montevideo. As of 2012, the two teams have won 90 of the 108 Uruguayan Primera División titles, and many international tournaments, including a combined eight Copa Libertadores. The first meeting between the two teams was at the turn of the century in 1900, making it one of the oldest football rivalries outside Great Britain. CURCC, which would go on to become Peñarol, won the first match 2–0.
