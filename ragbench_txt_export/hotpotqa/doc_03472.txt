Cartwright â€“ Roblin Municipality is a rural municipality in the Canadian province of Manitoba that incorporated on January 1, 2015 via the amalgamation of the RM of Roblin (2011 population 932) and the Village of Cartwright (2011 population 308). It was formed as a requirement of "The Municipal Amalgamations Act", which required that municipalities with a population less than 1,000 amalgamate with one or more neighbouring municipalities by 2015. The Government of Manitoba initiated these amalgamations in order for municipalities to meet the 1997 minimum population requirement of 1,000 to incorporate a municipality.
