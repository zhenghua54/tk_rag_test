The Military Merit Cross ("Militär-Verdienstkreuz") was the highest bravery award of the Kingdom of Prussia for non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers. It was also known as the Golden Military Merit Cross ("Goldenes Militär-Verdienstkreuz") to distinguish it from the Military Decoration 1st Class ("Militär-Ehrenzeichen I. Klasse"), a lesser Prussian enlisted bravery decoration which was an identical cross but in silver. The Military Merit Cross came to also be known as the "Pour le Mérite for non-commissioned officers and enlisted men" ("Orden Pour le Mérite für Unteroffiziere und Mannschaften"), after the Pour le Mérite, Prussia's highest military decoration for officers.
