Black conservatism in the United States is a political and social movement rooted in communities of African descent that aligns largely with the American conservative movement. Since the Civil Rights Movement, the black community has generally fallen to the left of the right-wing conservative movement, and has predominantly favored itself on the side of liberalism and civil rights progressives. Black conservatism, in contrast, emphasizes traditionalism, strong patriotism, capitalism, free markets, and sometimes strong social conservatism.
