Milton was a series of animated shorts created by Mike Judge in 1991. They aired on "Saturday Night Live" in the mid 1990s, and like Mike Judge's other early shorts, appeared on MTV's Liquid Television in the early 1990s. The 1999 film "Office Space" was based upon the cartoons, and featured actor Stephen Root in the role of Milton Waddams. In the cartoon shorts all voices are by Mike Judge. Although Milton was the title character from the shorts, the role was a supporting character in the "Office Space" movie, as was his boss, Bill Lumbergh (played by actor Gary Cole in "Office Space"). Milton traveled to different locations despite being consistently late for his taxis to take him there.
