Ash is a Northern Irish alternative rock band, formed in Downpatrick in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist Tim Wheeler, bassist Mark Hamilton and drummer Rick McMurray. As a three-piece, they released mini-album "Trailer" in 1994 and full-length album "1977" in 1996. This 1996 release was named by "NME" as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record "Nu-Clear Sounds" in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy the band released "Free All Angels" in 2001 and a string of successful singles.
