Adenomyosis is a gynecologic medical condition characterized by the abnormal presence of endometrial tissue (the inner lining of the uterus) within the myometrium (the thick, muscular layer of the uterus). In contrast, when endometrial tissue is present entirely outside the uterus, it represents a similar but distinct medical condition called endometriosis. The two conditions are found together in many cases, but often occur independently. Before being recognized as its own condition, adenomyosis used to be called "endometriosis interna". Additionally, the less-commonly used term "adenomyometritis" is a more specific name for the condition, specifying involvement of the uterus.
