"Range Life" is a song by Pavement, the third single from their 1994 album "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain". The song attracted attention with controversial lyrics that seemed to mock alternative rock superstars the Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots; Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan expressed his displeasure in magazine interviews, while songwriter Stephen Malkmus maintained that his words had been misinterpreted and no insult was intended. Regardless, Pavement, which was due to tour for Lollapalooza in 1994, got kicked out when the Smashing Pumpkins, the headlining act, threatened to cancel their Lollapalooza dates if Pavement played. Pavement would eventually play Lollapalooza the next year. An early 1993 demo of the song did not feature this verse; guitarist Spiral Stairs recalled in 2004 that when Malkmus first revealed these new lyrics to his bandmates at the New York City recording sessions for "CRCR", "we almost lost our lunch from laughing so much." The single was not commercially released in the USA; it was issued by the band's UK label at the time, Big Cat. Both B-sides are outtakes from the "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" sessions and are included on the 2004 of that album. This song was one of many to be included in the group's greatest hits album "".
