The Shreveport-Bossier City-Minden Combined Statistical Area was made up of four parishes in northwestern Louisiana. The statistical area consisted of then-Shreveport-Bossier City Metropolitan Statistical Area and then-Minden Micropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, the CSA had a population of 439,000 (though a July 1, 2011 estimate placed the population at 444,000). On February 28, 2013, OMB changed definitions of census statistical areas, and all four parishes in this combined statistical area were redefined as Shreveport-Bossier City Metropolitan Statistical Area.
