The 2015 CrossFit Games were held on July 21–26, 2015 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. Ben Smith, of Virginia, was the men's winner. A Games competitor every year since 2009, this was his first win (he placed third in 2011 and 2013). Smith secured the win in a dramatic final event by holding off 2014's second-place finisher Mat Fraser who many had predicted would be the 2015 champion. Iceland's Katrin Davidsdottir, making her third Games appearance, was the women's winner, overtaking countrywoman Ragnheiður Sara Sigmundsdottir, who led for much of the competition, in the final event. CrossFit Mayhem Freedom from Cookeville, Tennessee, captained by four-time individual men's champion Rich Froning Jr., won the Affiliate Cup.
