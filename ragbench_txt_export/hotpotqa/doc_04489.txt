Amex House, popularly nicknamed The Wedding Cake, is the former European headquarters of American Express, the multinational financial services company. It is located in the Carlton Hill area of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. The nine-floor building, designed by British architecture firm Gollins, Melvin, Ward & Partners, was commissioned by the company in 1977 to consolidate their operations in Brighton, which had been spread over several sites. The white and blue structure, a landmark on the city skyline, has received both praise and criticism for its distinctive style. Demolition work began in April 2016 after the completion of a new headquarters building on spare land on the site.
