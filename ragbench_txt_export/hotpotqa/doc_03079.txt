Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics was the third time an Olympic baseball tournament had been held as a full medal sport, and the ninth time it had been part of the Summer Olympic Games in any capacity. It was held in Sydney, Australia from 17 September through to the bronze and gold medal games on 27 September. Two venues were used for the Games: the Sydney Baseball Stadium and Blacktown Olympic Park. For the first time in Olympic competition, professional baseball players were eligible to participate, though no active players from Major League Baseball were available. Team USA, however, included Pat Borders, who had won World Series MVP with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1992, starting pitchers Roy Oswalt and Ben Sheets, who became MLB aces with the Houston Astros and Milwaukee Brewers respectively, and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, who won a World Series in 2004 with the Boston Red Sox. Last but not least, their manager was Tommy Lasorda, the Los Angeles Dodgers legend who had managed the Dodgers to two World Series in 1981 and 1988.
