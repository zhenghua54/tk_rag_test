"SexyBack" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake for his second studio album, "FutureSex/LoveSounds" (2006). It was released on July 18, 2006, to US mainstream and rhythmic radio stations by Jive Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written and produced by Nate Hills, Tim Mosley, and Timberlake himself. Discussing "SexyBack", Timberlake revealed that he went "left", singing the song in a rock style, not an R&B style. He described the song as musicians David Bowie and David Byrne "covering" James Brown's 1970 song "Sex Machine". The track features Timbaland on backing vocals, while Timberlake's voice is distorted. The instrumentation used in the song includes a pounding bass beat, electronic chords, and drum machine sounds.
