The Indian Refining Company was an American oil company in operation from the first decade of the 1900s to April 2, 1943. It was bought by the Texas Company in 1931. It had an oil refinery based in Lawrenceville, Illinois. Indian Refining patented the first "wax free" oil under the Havoline brand. The chemists at the Lawrenceville, Illinois refinery developed the wax free motor oil which led to an Indian Refining patent. The Texas Company (TEXACO) acquired Indian Refining in 1931 primarily to access the formulation for wax free motor oil, which was developed and is currently the standard for all conventional motor oils throughout the world.
