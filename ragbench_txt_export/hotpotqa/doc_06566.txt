He was an important figure in the history of Muskegon, Michigan. With his father he arrived in Muskegon in 1856 from Indiana to work on the creation of the early Michigan roadways. Later he became the owner of many acres of cutting grounds throughout Michigan. Later on (with business partner Thomas Hume) he opened the Hackley-Hume Lumber Mill on Muskegon Lake in 1854. After many successful years the mill of operation, the mill closed in 1894, after most of Michigan's Lower Peninsula had been effectively deforested.
