Crime Cutz is the second extended play by American synthpop duo Holy Ghost!, consisting of Nick Millhiser and Alex Frankel. Its title came from the name of a person of the same name who offered a drum break for the title track that was not included in the final mix. Containing a 1980s-style atmosphere and noted by one reviewer to be the duo's cleanest sounding release so far, the extended play was influenced by Russian disco records Frankel found on eBay. DFA Records released the title track as a single in February 2016, and the EP was distributed in April 2016 to generally positive reviews.
