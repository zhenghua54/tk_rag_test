Tyson Gay (born August 9, 1982) is an American track and field sprinter who competes in the 100 and 200 meters dash. His 100 m personal best of 9.69 seconds is the American record and makes him tied for second fastest athlete ever, after Usain Bolt. His 200 m time of 19.58 makes him the sixth fastest athlete in that event. He has since received a one-year ban for doping.
