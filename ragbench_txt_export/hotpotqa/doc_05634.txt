"Long live our noble Duke" is an alteration traditionally made within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire to the anthem 'God Save the Queen'. The anthem still uses the same lyrics and instrumental tune, but the second line "Long live our noble Queen" is changed to "Long live our noble Duke" out of respect to the reigning monarch in their capacity as the Duke of Lancaster. The title is always held by the monarch as head of the royal Duchy of Lancaster, historically Lancaster being the county town of Lancashire. No matter if the sovereign is male or female, they always retain the style of Duke, therefore the variant second line never changes even if 'God save the Queen' changes to 'God Save the King' and vice versa.
