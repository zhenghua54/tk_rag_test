The TJX Companies, Inc. (), is an American apparel and home goods company based in Framingham, Massachusetts. It claims to be the largest international apparel and home fashions off-price department store chain in the United States. The company evolved from the Zayre discount department store chain, founded in 1956, which opened its first branch of T.J.Maxx in 1976 and its first BJ's Wholesale Club in 1984. In 1988, Zayre sold its nameplate to rival Ames, and T.J.Maxx was renamed "The TJX Companies, Inc.".
