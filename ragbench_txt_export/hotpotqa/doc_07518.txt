"We Bring an Arsenal" was supposed to be the second single from "Weapons", the fifth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets, planned to be released 4 June 2012. It has been released to rock radio since this date in the United States, but the single has yet to be officially released in the UK as of 5 June 2012, but will unlikely happen due to Ian Watkins's imprisonment in 2013. It was first played live on 25 February 2012 at Brisbane, Australia.
