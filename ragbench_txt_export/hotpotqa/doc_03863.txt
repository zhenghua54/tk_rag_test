Charles James Correll (February 2, 1890 â€“ September 26, 1972) was an American radio comedian, best known for his work on the "Amos 'n' Andy" show with Freeman F. Gosden. Correll voiced the central character of Andy Brown, along with various supporting characters. Correll was born in Peoria, Illinois. Before teaming up with Gosden, he worked as a stenographer and a bricklayer. The two men met in Durham, North Carolina while working for the Joe Bren Producing Company. Both Correll and Freeman vacationed at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin in the 1930s and would broadcast "Amos 'n' Andy" from there. From 1928 to 1934, the team never took a vacation away from their radio show. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of "Amos 'n' Andy" on the air, the broadcast of March 19, 1958 was done by Correll and Gosden using their real voices and calling each other by their real names; this had never been done on the show before.
