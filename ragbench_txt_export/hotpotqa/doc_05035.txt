High School High is a 1996 comedy film about an inner city high school in the Los Angeles, California area, starring Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Mekhi Phifer, Louise Fletcher, Malinda Williams, and Brian Hooks. It is a spoof of movies concerning idealistic teachers being confronted with a class of cynical teenagers, disengaged by conventional schooling, and loosely parodies "The Principal", "Dangerous Minds", "Lean on Me", "The Substitute", and "Stand and Deliver". It also notably parodies the LA River drag race from "Grease".
