Red Thunder is a rock band formed in 1990 by Apache Native American frontman Robby Romero, incorporating Native American musical instruments, melody and themes, a style sometimes called by the pun "alter-native". Red Thunder rose to prominence with founder Robby Romero's designation as a United Nations Ambassador of Youth for the Environment in 1990, the heavy rotation of his singles on VH1 and MTV, and the worldwide airing of his social- and environmental-themed films (including Americaâ€™s Last Frontier, Hidden Medicine and Makoce Wakan), Red Thunder has commanded the largest audience of any contemporary Native American music group.
