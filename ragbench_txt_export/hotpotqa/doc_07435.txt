Finding Chandra: A True Washington Murder Mystery is a non-fiction book by Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz, two Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalists at the "Washington Post". The book, released in May 2010, chronicles the 2001 disappearance of Washington, DC intern Chandra Levy, whose remains were found one year later in an isolated area of the city's 2800 acre Rock Creek Park. Higham and Horwitz present a thoroughly researched narrative of Chandra's case and the factors that complicated itâ€”an affair between the victim and Congressman Gary Condit, missteps by DC law enforcement, and relentless scrutiny from national media. "Finding Chandra" has received early praise, most notably from fellow "Washington Post" colleague Bob Woodward, who declared it to be "Washington's "In Cold Blood", expertly and marvelously told by two of journalism's greatest investigative reporters."
