The Capture of St Lucia was the result of a campaign by British land and naval forces to capture the island of St Lucia, which was a French Colony. Britain's actions followed the capture of the British controlled island of Dominica by French forces after a surprise invasion in September 1778. During the Battle of St. Lucia the British fleet defeated a French fleet sent to reinforced the island, and a few days later French troops were soundly defeated by British troops during the Battle of Morne de la Vierge. Realising that another British fleet would arrive shortly with reinforcements, the French garrison surrendered. The remaining French troops were evacuated and the French fleet returned to Martinique, leaving the island in the hands of the British.
