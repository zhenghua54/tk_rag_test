The Siwi language (also known as Siwan, Siwa Berber) is the easternmost Berber language, spoken in Egypt by an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people in the oases of Siwa and Gara, near the Libyan border. The language has been heavily influenced by Arabic, notably Egyptian and Bedouin, but also earlier stages of Arabic. It continues to be the normal language of communication between Siwis among themselves, but may be threatened by contacts with outsiders and the use of Arabic in mixed marriages; nearly all Siwis today learn to speak Arabic as a second language from an early age.
