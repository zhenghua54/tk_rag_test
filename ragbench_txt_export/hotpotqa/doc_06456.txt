Ice Princess is a 2005 American figure-skating film directed by Tim Fywell, written by Hadley Davis from a story by Meg Cabot and Davis, and starring Michelle Trachtenberg, Joan Cusack, Kim Cattrall and Hayden Panettiere. The film focuses on Casey Carlyle, a normal teenager who gives up a promising future academic life in order to pursue her new-found dream of being a professional figure skater. The film was released on March 18, 2005. "Ice Princess" had an unsuccessful performance at the box office, grossing $24 million in the United States during its theatrical run against a production budget of $25 million. It did, however, inspire Zahra Lari, a Muslim in the United Arab Emirates, to take up the sport, become an Olympics 2018 hopeful, and inspire more freedom for women.
