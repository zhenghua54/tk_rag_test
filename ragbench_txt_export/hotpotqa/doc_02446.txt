Helmut Rauca (3 November 1908 – 29 October 1983) was the Holocaust perpetrator instrumental in the murder of more than 10,000 Jews from the Kaunas Ghetto, Lithuania, during World War II. He was a member of "Einsatzgruppe A" in the rank of "Hauptscharführer" (master sergeant). As the Gestapo Jewish Affairs Specialist, Rauca was responsible for the selection of about one-third of the Ghetto inmates including men, women, and children, to be killed during the "Große Aktion" known as the Kaunas massacre of October 29, 1941 perpetrated at the remote Ninth Fort on the outskirts of Kaunas.
