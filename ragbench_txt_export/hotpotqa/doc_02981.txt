Jane Vain and the Dark Matter is an indie rock band formed in 2005 from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The band is fronted by Calgary native Jamie Fooks, and signed to Edmonton’s Rectangle Records. They describe their sound as indie electro-pop. The "Montreal Mirror" called their music “melancholy" and "macabre,” and Fooks has been compared to Emily Haines, Cat Power, and Fiona Apple. They released their first full-length album, "Love Is Where the Smoke Is", in January 2008.
