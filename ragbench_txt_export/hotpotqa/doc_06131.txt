Elatostema is a genus of flowering plants containing approximately 350 known species in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to tropical forest clearings throughout Australasia, Asia and Africa. There may be as many as 1,000 species of this little-known genus, which is susceptible to deforestation and other forms of human exploitation. Some species, for instance the recently discovered "E. fengshanense", show unusual adaptations to growing in deep shade in caves. DNA analysis suggests that the three genera "Elastostema", "Pellionia", and "Pilea" be grouped together as one.
