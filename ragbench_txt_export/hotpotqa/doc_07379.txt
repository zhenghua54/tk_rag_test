The Battle of Okinawa (Japanese: 沖縄戦 , Hepburn: Okinawa-sen ) (Okinawan: 沖縄戦 , "Uchinaa ikusa " ), codenamed Operation Iceberg, was a major battle of the Pacific War fought on the island of Okinawa by United States Marine and Army forces against the Imperial Japanese Army and included the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific War during World War II, the April 1, 1945, invasion of Okinawa itself. The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945. After a long campaign of island hopping, the Allies were planning to use Okinawa, a large island only 340 mi away from mainland Japan, as a base for air operations for the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands.
