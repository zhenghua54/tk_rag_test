The Pretzel Amusement Ride Company was a famous manufacturer of pretzel dark rides. Pretzel built over 1400 pretzel rides and sold them to carnivals and parks. The pretzel ride was invented by Marvin Rempfer. Leon Cassidy was Marvin's partner in the Pretzel Amusement Ride Company. Both names are on the patent. Leon Cassidy patented the single-rail dark ride in 1928 along with Marvin Rempfer. The company originated in Tumbling Dam Park on the banks of Sunset Lake in Bridgeton, New Jersey. A rider said that ""It felt like I was turned and twisted like a Pretzel"", so the name Pretzel was chosen. A large heavy pretzel design was originally affixed to the front of each car to prevent the car from flipping backwards. In 1929, a standard Pretzel ride had five cars, 350 feet of track, and was one and a half minutes per ride. A pretzel ride sold for $1,200.
