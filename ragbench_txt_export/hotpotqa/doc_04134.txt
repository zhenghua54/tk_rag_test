The Toyota E engine family is a straight-4 piston engine series, and uses timing belt rather than a chain. The E engines were the first multi-valve engines from Toyota designed with economy, practicality and everyday use in mind (rather than performance). Like many other Toyota engines from the era, the E engine series features a cast iron block, along with an aluminum cylinder head. E engines are lighter compared to earlier Toyota engines, due the hollow crankshaft, thinned casting of the cylinder block, and several other reductions in auxiliaries as well as in the engine itself. Carbureted versions include a newly designed, variable-venturi carburetor. All of these changes improved economy and emissions. The members of the E engine family, range from 1.0 L to 1.5 L. The E family supplanted the "K" engines in most applications. A large number of parts in the E engine series are interchangeable between each other.
