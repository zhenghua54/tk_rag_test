Trump National Golf Club Westchester is a private golf club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Owned by Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, the 140 acre course has eighteen holes, with a 75000 sqft clubhouse. Founded in 1922 as "Briarcliff Country Club", it later operated as "Briar Hills Country Club" and "Briar Hall Golf and Country Club" before Trump's purchase of the property in 1996. Trump renamed the club to match his other golf properties, and after its county, Westchester. He had the clubhouse and course rebuilt for its 2002 reopening; the course was designed by Jim Fazio. Donald Trump served as president over Trump National Golf Club LLC (managing the Westchester club) from August 2000 until January 19, 2017, the day before his inauguration.
