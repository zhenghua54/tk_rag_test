Jasper Douglas Pyne (1847 â€“ 14 November 1888) was an Irish nationalist politician from County Waterford who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1885 until his unexplained death. Pyne was the fourth child of the Reverend William Masters Pyne and his wife Marian. Rev W M Pyne came from Ballyvolane near Cork but he was the Rector of St Mary's Church in Oxted, Surrey from 1828 to 1869, a remarkable tenure of 41 years. The Pyne family lived in the Rectory (now called Oxted Place) until the Rev W M Pyne inherited Ballyvolane House on his father's death.
