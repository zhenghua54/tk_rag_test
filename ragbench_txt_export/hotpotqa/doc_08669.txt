Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album "OK Computer", songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments. They incorporated influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded "Kid A" with "OK Computer" producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks, and Radiohead split the work in two albums: "Kid A" and "Amnesiac". The latter was released the following year.
