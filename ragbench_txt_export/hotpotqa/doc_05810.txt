A Little Princess is a children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, first published as a book in 1905. It is an expanded version of the short story "Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's", which was serialized in "St. Nicholas Magazine" from December 1887. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 play "A Little Un-fairy Princess" based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with "the things and people that had been left out before". The novel was published by Charles Scribner's Sons (also publisher of "St. Nicholas") with illustrations by Ethel Franklin Betts and the full title "A Little Princess: Being the Whole Story of Sara Crewe Now Being Told for the First Time".
