Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots is a cancelled first-person shooter video game, part of the "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" series, announced on the cover of the December 2011 issue of "Game Informer". It was to be published by Ubisoft, and was developed by the company's Montreal studio, with additional development by Ubisoft Toronto and Red Storm Entertainment. Due to the death of Tom Clancy in October 2013, concern was raised that this game would become the last to bear his name. Ubisoft has since stated that they will continue putting Tom Clancy's name on future Tom Clancy titles out of respect for the late author.
