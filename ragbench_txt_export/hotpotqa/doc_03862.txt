Andrew "Andy" O'Brien is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Ross Davidson. One of the original characters created for the series, Andy made his first appearance one month after the show first broadcast, in the 10th episode on 21 March 1985. Portrayed as altruistic and middle-classed, Andy and his girlfriend Debbie were an attempt to represent gentrification of the East End. Despite Davidson claiming that there had been plans for his character, Andy became the first regular character in "EastEnders" to be killed-off. Davidson claimed this was due to an altercation between himself and Executive Producer and show creator, Julia Smith. His death scene aired in August 1986.
