Depeche Mode are an English electronic band that formed in Basildon, Essex in 1980. The group consists of founders Dave Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Andy Fletcher (keyboards, bass guitar). Depeche Mode released their debut album "Speak & Spell" in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Original band member Vince Clarke (keyboards, guitar), left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record "A Broken Frame", released the following year. Gore took over the lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, bass guitar) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next 13 years. Depeche Mode have been a trio again since 1995, when Wilder left.
