iPray TV is a Christian church ministry and video streaming service founded by Michael Peros which streams live video from the holy sites in Jerusalem. It is the first live video streaming service to accomplish this. They first became notable by doing the first live streaming of the Christmas celebration at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem in 2008, as well as the Easter and Pentecost celebrations of 2009. They also streamed the first broadcast live from inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Because of their use of Unicast technology, millions of people were able to view the broadcast at once, which had not been done before.
