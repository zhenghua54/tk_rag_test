The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (often called the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (大日本帝國陸軍航空部隊 , Dainippon Teikoku Rikugun Kōkūbutai ) (IJAAS or IJAAF), was the land-based aviation force of the Imperial Japanese Army. As with the IJA itself, the IJAAS was developed along the lines of Imperial German Army Aviation so its primary mission was to provide tactical close air support for ground troops while maintaining a limited air interdiction capability. The IJAAS also provided important reconnaissance support for the Army. However, the Army Air Service usually did not control the light aircraft or balloons deployed and operated by the IJA artillery battalions as spotters or observers. Although the Army Air Service engaged in strategic bombing of enemy cities such as Shanghai, Nanking, Canton, Chongqing, Rangoon, and Mandalay, this was not its primary mission, and it lacked the heavy strategic bombers as were later deployed by the United States Army Air Forces.
