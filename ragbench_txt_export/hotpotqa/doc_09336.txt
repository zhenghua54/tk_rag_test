Moonrunners is a 1975 film, starring James Mitchum, about a Southern family that runs bootleg liquor. It was reworked four years later into the popular long-running television series "The Dukes of Hazzard", and as such the two productions share many similar concepts. Mitchum had co-starred with his father, Robert Mitchum, in the similar drive-in favorite "Thunder Road" eighteen years earlier, which also focused upon moonshine-running bootleggers using fast cars to elude federal agents. "Moonrunners", a B movie, was filmed in 1973 and awaited release for over a year. Its soundtrack reflects the outlaw music boom of the 1970s during which the film was released.
