Democratic confederalism, also known as democratic federalism, is a libertarian socialist political system developed by Abdullah Ã–calan based on the ideas of Murray Bookchin. He describes it as "open towards other political groups and factions" and as "flexible, multi-cultural, anti-monopolistic, and consensus-oriented." The ideology is closely associated with the polity of Rojava, where it is the governing political system.
