EAFF E-1 Football Championship, known as the East Asian Football Championship from 2003 to 2010, and the EAFF East Asian Cup for the 2013 and 2015 editions, is a men's international football competition in East Asia for member nations of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF). Before the EAFF was founded in 2002, the Dynasty Cup was held between the East Asian top four teams, and was regarded as the unofficial East Asian Championship. There is a separate competition for both men (first held in 2003) and women (first held in 2005). There was also a combined points competition in 2005, where the results of the men's and women's teams are added together (not including qualifiers).
