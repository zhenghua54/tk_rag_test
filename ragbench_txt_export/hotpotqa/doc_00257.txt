The Ford CD2 platform (for "C/D-class" and called "U204" internally) is an automobile platform for crossover SUVs. It is the basis for the Mazda Tribute, Ford Escape, and Mercury Mariner, and was jointly developed by Mazda and Ford. The design is based on Mazda's GF platform, used by the Mazda Capella/626.
