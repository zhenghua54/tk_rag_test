The European Short Course Swimming Championships (variously referred to informally as the "Short Course Europeans" or "European 25m Championships") are a swimming meet, organized by LEN. The meet features swimmers from Europe, competing in events in a short course (25-meter) pool. The meet has traditionally been held in the beginning of December. Annual until 2013, the event now occurs in odd years.
