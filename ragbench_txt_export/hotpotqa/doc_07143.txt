Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as "malanga", "otoy", "otoe", cocoyam (or new cocoyam), "tannia", "tannier", "yautía", "macabo", "ocumo", "macal", "taioba", "dasheen", "quequisque", "ʻ ape" and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro ("taro kongkong"). Many other species (including especially "X. roseum") are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera "Caladium", "Colocasia" (i.e., taro), and "Alocasia".
