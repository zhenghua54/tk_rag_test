North Carolina Highway 2A (NC 2A) was a state highway located in southern Moore County, in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway traveled from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1), now May Street, northward through portions of Manly and Southern Pines to an intersection with NC 22 (now US 1). The highway was first listed as part of the Moore County road system by at least 1930. The route was improved to a paved surface by 1936. NC 2A was numbered sometime between 1945 and 1949. By 1952, it was cancelled and Highway 2 was designated over the route. It has since been numbered Secondary Road 2029 (SR 2029).
