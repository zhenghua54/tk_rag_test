Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation is one of seven American Indian reservations in the U.S. state of Montana. Established by an act of Congress in 1916, it was originally intended for landless Chippewa (Ojibwe) Indians in the American West, but has grown to include many Cree (Nēhiyaw) and Métis over the years. The reservation is located in Hill and Chouteau counties in northeastern Montana, about 40 mi from the Canada–U.S. border. It has a total land area of 171.4 sqmi , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. The reservation is reported to have 6,177 enrolled members.
