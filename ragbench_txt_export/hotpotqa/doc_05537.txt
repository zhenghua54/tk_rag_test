"Make Me Crazy" is the second and final single by Scandal'us from their debut album "Startin' Somethin' ". It did not live up to the success of their debut single, "Me, Myself & I", only managing to debut and peak at No. 30 on the Australian ARIA Charts. This was the last release from the band before they broke up in 2002.
