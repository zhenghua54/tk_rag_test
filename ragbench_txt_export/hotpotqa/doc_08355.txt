Cadore (] ; Ladin: "Cadòr" ; Venetian: "Cadòr "or, rarely," Cadòria" ; German: "Cadober "or" Kadober" ; Sappada German: "Kadour"; Friulian: "Cjadovri" ) is a historical region in the Italian region of Veneto, in the northernmost part of the province of Belluno bordering on Austria, the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. It is watered by the Piave River which has its source in the Carnic Alps. Once an undeveloped and poor district, the former "contado" (countship) of Cadore now has a thriving economy based on tourism and a small manufacturing industry, specialising in the production of glasses.
