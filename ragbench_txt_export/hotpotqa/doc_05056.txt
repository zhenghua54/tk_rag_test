An article about the session was published in the "Memphis Press-Scimitar" under the title "Million Dollar Quartet". The recording was first released in Europe in 1981 as "The Million Dollar Quartet" with 17 tracks. A few years later more tracks were discovered and released as "The Complete Million Dollar Session". In 1990, the recordings were released in the United States as "Elvis Presley - The Million Dollar Quartet". This session is considered a seminal moment in rock and roll.
