No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017. The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death. "No Plan" compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, "Lazarus", including the titular "Lazarus", "No Plan", "Killing a Little Time", and "When I Met You". The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack. The recordings featured on "No Plan" come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album "Blackstar", with "Lazarus" appearing as the third track on the album. Upon release, "No Plan" debuted at #138 on the "Billboard" 200. The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP. It was directed by Tom Hingston.
