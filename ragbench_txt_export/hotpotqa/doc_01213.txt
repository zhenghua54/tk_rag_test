Hunt Valley Towne Centre, formerly Hunt Valley Mall, is an outdoor shopping mall in northern Baltimore County, Maryland. The development was constructed following the closure of Hunt Valley Mall (other than its anchor stores) in 2000. The anchor stores in existence today include Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Coat Factory, Wegmans, and Sears. Wal-Mart was located at Hunt Valley mall until late October 2007, when it moved two miles south to Cockeysville, Maryland. It was replaced by Best Buy which closed in May 2012 as part of a nationwide downsizing. Near a gazebo located in the main street area of the center, there is a memorial to Chuck Thompson.
