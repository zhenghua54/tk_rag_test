The step over (also known as the pedalada, the den√≠lson, or the scissors) is a dribbling move, or feint, in football, used to fool a defensive player into thinking the offensive player, in possession of the ball, is going to move in a direction he does not intend to move in. The move was reportedly invented by Argentine striker Pedro Calomino in the early 1900s. It was reportedly first used in Europe by Dutch player Law Adam, who was famous for it in the late 1920s/early 1930s, earning the nickname "Adam the Scissorsman", and it was later also used in Italy by Amedeo Biavati in the 1930s. It was popularised in the mid-1990s by global superstar Ronaldo. Nowadays, the technique is in widespread use by attacking players all over the world, such as Cristiano Ronaldo.
