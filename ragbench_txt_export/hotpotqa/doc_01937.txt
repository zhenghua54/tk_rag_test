Richard Ira Bong (September 24, 1920 â€“ August 6, 1945) was a United States Army Air Forces major and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the country's highest-scoring flying ace in the war, being credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft. All of his aerial victories were in the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter. He died in California while testing a jet aircraft shortly before the Japanese surrendered and the war ended.
