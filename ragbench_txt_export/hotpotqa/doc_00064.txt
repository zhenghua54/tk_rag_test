Manchester is the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, the eleventh largest city in New England, and as of 2016 the largest city in northern New England, an area comprising the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 109,565, and its estimated 2016 population was 110,506. It is located in Hillsborough County along the banks of the Merrimack River, which divides the city into eastern and western sections. Manchester is near the northern end of the Northeast megalopolis. It was first named by the merchant and inventor Samuel Blodget (after whom Samuel Blodget Park and Blodget Street in Manchester's North End are named). Blodget's vision was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original Manchester in England, which was the world's first industrialized city.
