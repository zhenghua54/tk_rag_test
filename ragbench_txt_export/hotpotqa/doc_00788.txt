Ingarö is an island in Värmdö Municipality, Stockholm County. The chief settlement is called Brunn. With an area of 63 km, it is the 16th biggest island in Sweden. Petroglyphs indicate that the island has been inhabited since the Nordic Bronze Age. For most of the 20th century the resident population decreased, while at the same time many vacation homes were built. However, in recent years population has grown as new homes are being built and vacation homes are being converted into permanent homes. Improved communications has made it feasible to commute to Stockholm.
