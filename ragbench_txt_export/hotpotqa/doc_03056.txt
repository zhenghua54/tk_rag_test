Maurice Rupert Bishop (29 May 1944 – 19 October 1983) was a Grenadian politician and the leader of New Jewel Movement – popular efforts in the areas of socio-economic development, education, and Black liberation – that came to power during the 13 March 1979 revolution that removed Eric Gairy from office. Bishop headed the People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada from 1979 to 1983, when he was dismissed from his post and shot during the coup by Bernard Coard, a staunch Marxist-Leninist in the government, leading to upheaval.
