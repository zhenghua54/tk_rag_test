Patterns of Sexual Behavior is a 1951 book by Clellan S. Ford and Frank A. Beach. In this work of scientific literature, the authors integrate information about human sexual behavior from 191 different cultures, and include detailed comparisons across animal species, with particular emphasis on primates. The book, which has been called a "classic" of its field, provided the foundation for the later research of Masters and Johnson. A revised edition, titled "Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives", was published in 1977.
