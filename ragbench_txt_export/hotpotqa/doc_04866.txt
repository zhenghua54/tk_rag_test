SM "U-90" was a Type U 87 u-boat of the Imperial German Navy during World War I. Its commander Walter Remy made regular stops at remote island North Rona for provisions such as fresh mutton. On 15 May 1918, "U-90" shelled the Hirta wireless station in St Kilda, Scotland. On 31 May 1918, "U-90" torpedoed and sank USSÂ "President Lincoln" , a former Hamburg America Line steamer that had been seized by the United States for troop transportation. From the U.S. Navy crew that abandoned the sinking vessel, "U-90" captured Lieutenant Edouard Izac, eventually taking him to Germany. Izac later escaped German captivity and reported to the US Navy about German submarine movements.
