Hip Hop Republican is a combined music and politics blog started in 2004 by Richard Ivory. Ivory says that he started the blog in part because of frustration with the belief that blacks must be Democrats. The blog was credited with giving conservative blacks a sense of community during the 2008 presidential election when they were often expected to vote in solidarity with Barack Obama.
