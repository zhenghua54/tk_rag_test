"Wild One", originally titled "She's a Wild One", is a country music song written by Pat Bunch, Jaime Kyle, and Will Rambeaux. It was first recorded in 1992 by country band Zaca Creek on their album, "Broken Heartland", and country band Evangeline on their 1993 album, "French Quarter Moon". Faith Hill later covered the song on her 1993 debut album, "Take Me as I Am", and released it in late 1993 as her debut single. Hill's rendition was also her first Number One, spending the first four chart weeks of 1994 at the top of the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.
