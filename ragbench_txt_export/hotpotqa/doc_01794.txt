The Bukōchōshō (武功徴章 ) ("Badge for Military Merit"), commonly called the Bukōshō , was a military decoration of the Empire of Japan, established on 7 December 1944 by Imperial edict. It was awarded by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) to living soldiers who had performed with exceptional valor in battle. Airmen, especially fighter pilots defending Japan against enemy bombers, were most likely to win the award. Eighty-nine "Bukōshō" were awarded during the eight months it was actively awarded.
