Double Trouble is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from April 4, 1984 to March 30, 1985. The series stars identical twins Jean and Liz Sagal as Kate and Allison Foster, two teenagers living under the watchful eye of their widowed father. The show was considered an updating of the "twins in mischief" concept seen in films like "The Parent Trap" or the "Patty Duke Show" of the 1960s. The Sagal sisters acknowledged that Norman Lear, the Sagal family's godfather, was the one who held influence over the show's concept.
