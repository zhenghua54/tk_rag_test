Scoliopus, or fetid adderstongue, is a genus of plant within the Liliaceae family consisting of two species, "Scoliopus bigelovii" and "S. hallii." Both are found in deep shaded forests, primarily in the coastal counties of the western United States from central California to northern Oregon. The name ""Scoliopus"" derives from the Greek words "skolios" and "pous", meaning curved foot, a reference to the shape of the pedicel. Taxonomists believe that "Scoliopus" is closely related to "Calochortus", "Prosartes", "Streptopus" and "Tricyrtis", which all have creeping rhizomes as well as styles that divide at the tip.
