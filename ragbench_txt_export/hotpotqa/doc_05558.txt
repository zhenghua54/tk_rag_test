Hilden Grange is a coeducational preparatory school in Tonbridge, Kent, England. It caters for children from Nursery to Year 8. It has academic records at common entrance and scholarship levels. It is unusual for pupils who leave in Year 8 not to secure a place at their first place secondary school, with many going on to Tonbridge School and Sevenoaks School. Many of the children who leave in Year 6 take their 11+ exams, and secure places at prestigious Grammar Schools such as The Judd School and Tonbridge Grammar School. The School is very strong in the Arts, with a high proportion of children learning a musical instrument and participating in the many productions and concerts that take place throughout the year. The level of sports coaching is very high, and the atmosphere around the school is relaxed, yet respectful.
