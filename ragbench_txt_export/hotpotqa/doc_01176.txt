Tetrapolis (Greek: Τετράπολις ) comprised one of the twelve districts into which Attica was divided before the time of Theseus. The district was on a plain in the northeastern part of Attica and contained four cities: Marathon (Μαραθών ), Probalinthus (Προβάλινθος ), Tricorythus (Τρικόρυθος ), and Oenoe (Οἰνόη ). Stephanus of Byzantium claimed "Huttēnia" (Ὑττηνία) was its name among the Pelasgoi.
