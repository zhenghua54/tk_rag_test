Wanderlodge is a high end brand of Class A motorhome recreational vehicle that was built by the Blue Bird Body Company (now Blue Bird Corporation) in Fort Valley, Georgia, from about 1963 until 2009. Production started with a 31 ft gasoline-powered forward control (front engine) model and expanded to include larger diesel engine powered pusher (rear engine) models up to 45 ft in length. They remain highly prized by their owners and have an extensive service network.
