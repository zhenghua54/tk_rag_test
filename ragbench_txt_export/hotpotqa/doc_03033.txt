Diocesan Native Female Training School (DNFTS, ) was a school under the Anglican Church of Hong Kong in the 19th century, founded in 1860 and closed down in 1868. Its premises now belong to today's Bonham Road Government Primary School(). In 1869, another institution called Diocesan Home and Orphanage (DHO, later renamed Diocesan School and Orphanage, and now known as Diocesan Boys' School) was founded in the same place. Due to the obvious differences in founding groups, vision of education, personnel arrangement and students’ background, DNFTS has been regarded only as a forerunner, and called ‘the First Foundation’ by DHO and later DBS. Using 1869 as its founding year, DBS calls itself ‘the Second Foundation’. As for Diocesan Girls' School, founded in Rose Villas near DSO in 1899, it claims to be the successor of DNFTS and traces the founding year back to 1860.
