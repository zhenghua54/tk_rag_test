This is a list of members who were elected to the 27th Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (legislature) of Ireland. These TDs (Members of Parliament) were elected at the 1992 general election on 25 November 1992 and met on 14 December 1992. The 27th Dáil was dissolved by President Mary Robinson, at the request of the Taoiseach John Bruton on 15 May 1997. The 27th Dáil lasted 1,654 days, and saw a change of Taoiseach from Albert Reynolds to John Bruton. The 27th Dáil was unique in that a change of Taoiseach and government took place in 1994 without the need for a general election to be called.
