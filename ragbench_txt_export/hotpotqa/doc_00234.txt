Reader's Digest Press was a United States publisher of the mid-1970s to early 1980s, owned by The Reader's Digest Association. It published full-length, original non-fiction books, often concerning military or political topics. (It thus differed from the better-known Reader's Digest Condensed Books.) Its works were sometimes distributed by Thomas Y. Crowell Co.
