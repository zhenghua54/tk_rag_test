The Hyundai Sonata (Korean: 현대 쏘나타 ) is a mid-size car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 1985. The first generation Sonata was introduced in 1985, which was a facelifted Stellar with an engine upgrade, and was withdrawn from the market in two years due to poor customer reactions. While the original was only sold in South Korea, with limited exports to Canada and New Zealand, the second generation of 1988 was widely exported.
