The Storhamar Dragons are a Norwegian ice hockey club based in Hamar. They are members of the highest Norwegian ice hockey league, Eliteserien (known as GET-ligaen for sponsorship reasons). Their home arena has been Hamar OL-Amfi since 1992. Ice hockey in Hamar was first played in 1955 by boys who had been inspired by the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. This became the basis of Storhamar Ishockey, which was founded in 1957 as a department of the sports club Storhamar IL. Since 1998, they have been marketing themselves as the Storhamar Dragons. As of 2010, they have completed thirty seasons in the Eliteserien, winning 670 regular season games and seven league titles.
