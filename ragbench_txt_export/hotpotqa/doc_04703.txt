Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 â€“ March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and clandestine chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo, and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
