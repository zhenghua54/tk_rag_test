Swingin' Down Yonder is the first full-length, 12-inch album recorded by Dean Martin for Capitol Records during three sessions in September and October 1954 and February 1955. According to the original sleeve notes, all the songs have a "common geographical root: the American South." In 1963, Capitol Records re-released "Swingin' Down Yonder" under the titled "Southern Style".
