Man's World, also known under its abbreviation MW, is an Indian men's luxury lifestyle magazine. It was launched in March 2000 by Anuradha Mahindra, wife of industrialist Anand Mahindra and was conceived by two leading city journalists working for "Business India" - Radhakrishnan Nair, who was the Executive Editor of "Business India", and Harsh Man Rai, who worked as Photo Editor. According to Radhakrishnan, now Publisher and Editor of "Man's World", ""Man's World" was conceived to be India's answer to some of the leading international men's magazines". He also states that the magazine was "essentially targeted at a generation of young men who were coming of age, benefiting from the fruits of economic liberalisation of the 1990s." In 2010, Radhakrishnan, the founding editor of "Manâ€™s World", bought out the magazine from Mahindra.
