Sega Hard Girls (Japanese: セガ・ハード・ガールズ , Hepburn: Sega Hādo Gāruzu ) is a Japanese multimedia project produced as a collaboration between ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Bunko imprint and video game company Sega. The project re-imagines various Sega video game consoles as anthropomorphized goddesses who appear all over modern Japan. The project has inspired a light novel series written by Tōru Shiwasu with illustrations by Kei, which began serialization in ASCII Media Works' "Dengeki Bunko Magazine" in June 2013, and an anime television series adaptation titled "Hi-sCoool! SeHa Girls" (Hi☆sCoool! セハガール , Hai Sukūru SeHa Gāru ) by TMS Entertainment, which aired in Japan between October and December 2014. A crossover video game with Idea Factory's "Hyperdimension Neptunia" franchise, "Superdimension Neptune VS Sega Hard Girls", was released for the PlayStation Vita in Japan in November 2015, and in North America and Europe in October 2016.
