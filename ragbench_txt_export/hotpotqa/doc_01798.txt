Fantastic was an American digest size fantasy and science fiction magazine, published from 1952 to 1980. It was founded by Ziff Davis as a fantasy companion to "Amazing Stories". Early sales were good, and Ziff Davis quickly decided to switch "Amazing" from pulp format to digest, and to cease publication of their other science fiction pulp, "Fantastic Adventures". Within a few years sales fell, and Howard Browne, the editor, was forced to switch the focus to science fiction rather than fantasy. Browne lost interest in the magazine as a result and the magazine generally ran poor quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, Paul W. Fairman.
