Polypodium is a genus of 75–100 species of true ferns, widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek "poly" (πολύ) "many" + "podion" (πόδιον) "little foot", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypody or rockcap fern, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.
