Grizzly River Run is located at Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It is similar to Kali River Rapids in Disney's Animal Kingdom but distinctive as the rafts are engineered to spin as they descend chutes. The attraction's name comes from Grizzly Peak, the bear shaped mountain that the rapids flow around. It was designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and constructed by Intamin.
