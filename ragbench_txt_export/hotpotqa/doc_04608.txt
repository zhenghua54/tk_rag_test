Mr. Fezziwig is a character from the novel "A Christmas Carol" created by Charles Dickens to provide contrast with Ebenezer Scrooge's attitudes towards business ethics. Scrooge, who apprenticed under Fezziwig, is the very antithesis of the person he worked for as a young man. Mr. Fezziwig is portrayed as a jovial, foppish man with a large Welsh wig. In Act I, Scene 5 of "A Christmas Carol", the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge to revisit his youthful days in Fezziwig's world located at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution. Dickens used Fezziwig to represent a set of communal values and a way of life which was quickly being swept away in the economic turmoil of the early nineteenth century.
