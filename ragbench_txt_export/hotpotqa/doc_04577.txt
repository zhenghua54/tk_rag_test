The Cherokee Nation (ᏣᎳᎩᎯ ᎠᏰᎵ, pronounced "Tsalagihi Ayeli") from 1794–1907 was a legal, autonomous, tribal government in North America recognized from 1794 to 1907. Often referred to simply as ""The Nation"" by its inhabitants, it should not be confused with what is known in the 21st century also as the Cherokee Nation.
