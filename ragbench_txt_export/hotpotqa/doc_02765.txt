Johann Strauss II (October 25, 1825 â€“ June 3, 1899), also known as Johann Strauss Jr., the Younger, the Son (German: "Sohn" ), Johann Baptist Strauss, was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely then responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century.
