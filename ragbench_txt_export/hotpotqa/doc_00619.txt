California's Gold is a public television human interest program that explores the natural, cultural, and historical features of California. The series ran for 24 seasons beginning in 1991, and was produced and hosted by Huell Howser in collaboration with KCET, Los Angeles. The series ceased production when Howser retired in November 2012, shortly before his death on January 7, 2013, although episodes continued to be shown for some time after his death. In May 2016, KCET showed a "lost" episode on the Charles F. Lummis House, now considered to be the final episode.
