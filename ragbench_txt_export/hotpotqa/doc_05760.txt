Jack Wiggins was an African-American entertainer of the early twentieth century, now remembered primarily for his elegant style in tap dancing. Wiggins worked as a performer at the Hoofers Club on "Swing Street" in Harlem, New York, where he inspired Laurence Donald "Baby Laurence" Jackson (later a member of the Tap Dance Hall of Fame). Wiggins also influenced Fayard and Harold Nicholas of the famous Nicholas Brothers tap duo. Wiggins was recognized as a master soloist in the "Class Act" style of tap dancing. A signature dance of Wiggins' was the "tango twist."
