FC Zhemchuzhina Yalta (Russian: «Жемчужина» (Ялта) ; FC Zhemchuzhyna Yalta in Ukrainian transliteration) was a professional football club based in Yalta. Founded in 2010, the club reached the Ukrainian Second League for the 2012–13 season. In June 2013 it was refused a license for the league, however, and expelled from professional football, due to the club's debts. Following the 2014 Crimean Crisis, Zhemchuzhina were accepted into the Russian Professional Football League for the 2014–15 season. As Ukraine considers Crimea Ukrainian territory, Football Federation of Ukraine lodged a complaint with UEFA about Crimean clubs' participation in Russian competitions. UEFA's judgment is that any matches Zhemchuzhina plays "under the auspices of the Russian Football Union will not be recognised".
