Developed and performed by Dave Goelz, Gonzo made his first appearance in the 1970 special "The Great Santa Claus Switch", as the "Cigar Box Frackle". Originally a minor figure in "The Muppet Show", he soon evolved into one of the franchise's primary characters. Gonzo has appeared in every Muppet film, including "The Muppet Christmas Carol", where he portrayed author Charles Dickens and developed a double act with Rizzo the Rat.
