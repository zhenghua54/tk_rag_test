Gogmagog were a British supergroup put together by British record producer Jonathan King that featured former Iron Maiden members Paul Di'Anno and Clive Burr, former White Spirit and Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis, and bassist Neil Murray (Whitesnake and other bands). Two of the songs recorded were written by King; the third by composer Russ Ballard. Originally, the supergroup was to contain David Coverdale, John Entwistle and Cozy Powell, but this line-up "wasn't working out", according to Di Anno. He also insisted that he hated the finished product and that he "only did it for the money".
