A 200-foot game is an expression used in ice hockey to describe a forward's ability to have strong play at both ends of an ice rink, which is standardized at 200 feet long. Players who can play a 200-foot game are contrasted with players who score a lot of points by avoiding hard forechecking or backchecking, cherry picking their plays perhaps for breakaways, and avoiding fighting for the puck in the corners of the rink, such as Pavel Bure or Brett Hull. Playing a 200-foot game means fighting for each part of the ice, fighting for control of the puck whether it's in one's possession or not, and engaging using your body in traffic. Some examples of players who play or played a 200-foot game include Sidney Crosby, Mike Richards, Marian Hossa, Jonathan Toews, Pavel Datsyuk, Auston Matthews, and Gordie Howe.
