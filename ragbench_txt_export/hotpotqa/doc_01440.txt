Crepis, commonly known in some parts of the world as hawksbeard or hawk's-beard (but not to be confused with the related genus "Hieracium" with a similar common name), is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants of the family Asteraceae superficially resembling the dandelion, the most conspicuous difference being that "Crepis" usually has branching scapes with multiple heads (though solitary heads can occur). The genus name "Crepis" derives from the Greek "krepis", meaning "slipper" or "sandal", possibly in reference to the shape of the fruit.
