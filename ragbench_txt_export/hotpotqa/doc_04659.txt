The 1995–96 NBA season was the Magic's seventh season in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Magic signed unrestricted free agent Jon Koncak. Coming off their trip to the NBA Finals, the Magic clinched the Atlantic Division title with a 60–22 record. A regular season record which still stands as the best in franchise history. This despite missing Shaquille O'Neal for the first 22 games of the season due to a thumb injury. Anfernee Hardaway stepped up in O'Neal's absence and was awarded Player of the Month for November. The season saw Dennis Scott take a place in the league history books by scoring 267 three-point field goals, a single season record since broken by Stephen Curry, while O'Neal and Hardaway were both selected for the 1996 NBA All-Star Game.
