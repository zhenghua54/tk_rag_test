Ranger Rick, originally Ranger Rick's Nature Magazine, is a children’s nature magazine that is published by the United States National Wildlife Federation. The magazine offers feature articles and activities for children, ages 7 and up, in order to spark their interest in the outdoors and become more actively involved in the environment. The magazine's primary intention is to instill a passion for nature and promote activity outdoors. NWF also publishes two companion magazines, "Ranger Rick Jr.", which is aimed at ages 4–7, and "Ranger Rick Cub", which is aimed at kids 0–4 years old.)
