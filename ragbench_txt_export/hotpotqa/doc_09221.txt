Rio Airways was a regional passenger airline headquartered in Killeen, Texas, United States, which was operational from 1967 to 1987. Rio Airways briefly operated code sharing flights on behalf of Delta Air Lines whereby Rio flights were booked and sold under the Delta Connection brand name. Prior to the Delta Connection service, Rio Airways (Code "XO") operated independently but shared terminal gates at the DFW airport first with Texas International Airlines (1974), then with Braniff (1975-1978). Prior to operations at DFW it operated at Dallas Love Field, having its roots in two smaller commuter air carriers, Dal Airways and Hood Airways.
