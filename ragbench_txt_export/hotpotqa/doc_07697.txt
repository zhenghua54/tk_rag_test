Jed D. Hoyer (born December 7, 1973), is the executive vice-president and general manager of the Chicago Cubs. He has been the general manager of the San Diego Padres and the assistant general manager of the Boston Red Sox. He joined the Red Sox in 2002, after the ownership of John W. Henry, Tom Werner, and Larry Lucchino took over the team from John Harrington. He worked under the title of assistant to the general manager until December 2005. He then was given the title of assistant general manager. Hoyer briefly served as co-general manager of the Red Sox from December 12, 2005 to January 19, 2006 and then returning to his previous job of assistant general manager. In November 2003, he accompanied general manager Theo Epstein to Arizona to persuade pitcher Curt Schilling to accept a trade to the Red Sox, spending Thanksgiving at Schilling's home in what was eventually a successful effort.
