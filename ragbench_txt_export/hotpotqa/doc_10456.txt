Bill Porter (June 15, 1931 â€“ July 7, 2010) was an American audio engineer who helped shape the Nashville sound and recorded such stars as Chet Atkins, Louis Armstrong, the Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley, Barbara Streisand, Dianna Ross, Ike & Tina Turner, Sammy Davis Jr., and Roy Orbison from the late 1950s through the 1980s. In one week of 1960, his recordings accounted for 15 of "Billboard" magazine's "Top 100," a feat none have matched.
