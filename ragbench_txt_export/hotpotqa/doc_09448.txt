Mike Bushell is a sports presenter for the BBC. He presents the sport on "BBC Breakfast" on Fridays and at the weekends, and sometimes on other weekdays. Bushell holds the world record for trying different sports, on his Saturday morning slot, on BBC 1, in which he tries to inspire people off the sofa, to be more active and try a new activity. He maintains there is a sport for all, and no one should feel they can't do it. He has consequently tried out and profiled over 350 sports: ranging from the bizarre like shin kicking, whip cracking and swamp soccer to new mainstream sport initiatives like Rush hockey, spike volleyball, and shopping centre squash. His features often include top tips from the stars, like Serena Williams, Colin Montgomerie and Ben Ainslie.
