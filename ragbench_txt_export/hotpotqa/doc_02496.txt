A Prairie Home Companion is a live weekly radio variety show hosted by musician and songwriter Chris Thile. The program was created in 1974 by Garrison Keillor, who hosted it until 2016. It airs on Saturdays from 5 to 7 p.m. Central Time, from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota; it is also frequently heard on tours to New York City and other US cities. The show is known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Keillor's wry storytelling segment, "News from Lake Wobegon", was the show's best-known feature during his long tenure.
