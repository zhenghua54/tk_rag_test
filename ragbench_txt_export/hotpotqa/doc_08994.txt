Catan Dice Game is a German-style board game, developed by Klaus Teuber and published in 2007 by Catan GmbH and its licensors, Kosmos in Germany and Mayfair Games in English-speaking countries. It is a dice game re-imagining of Teuber's most notable title, "Settlers of Catan". "Catan Dice Game" can be played by any number of players, but is ideally suited for up to four. A variation, known as "Catan Dice Game Plus", is freely available from the "Catan" website, whose gameplay is closer to its "Settlers" origins.
