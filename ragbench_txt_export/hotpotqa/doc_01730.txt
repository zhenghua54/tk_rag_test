The 5th United States Colored Cavalry was a regiment of the United States Army organized as one of many Colored units during the American Civil War. The 5th USCC was one of the more notable black fighting units and it was officially organized, after its first two battles, in Kentucky in October 1864. It was commanded by Colonel James Brisbin until February 1865, when he took over the 6th US Colored Cavalry. His executive officer, Louis Henry Carpenter then commanded the regiment until 20 March 1866. The regiment was composed of ex-slaves, freedmen, and slaves. Many white officers from the unit were later assigned to the famed Buffalo Soldiers cavalry units. Many former USCC soldiers (later called troopers) volunteered for further service after their Civil War units were retired. The regiment isn't to be confused with the 5th Massachusetts Colored Cavalry
