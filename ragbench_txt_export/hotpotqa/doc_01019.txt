"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond", or simply "Loch Lomond" for short, is a well-known traditional Scottish song (Roud No. 9598) first published in 1841 in "Vocal Melodies of Scotland". The song prominently features Loch Lomond, the largest Scottish loch, located between the counties of Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire. In Scotland, the song is often the final piece of music played during an evening of revelry (a dance party or dinner, etc.).
