Fjällsätern is a minor mountain in southern Uddevalla, Sweden. Its summit reaches 105.9 m above sea level according to one 1950 estimate (an earlier one from 1903 put it at 300 Swedish feet), making it the area's second highest. There the local politician and publicist Ture Malmgren (1851–1922) began building his grand Tureborg Castle, today a ruin, in 1899. Along its slopes Malmgren constructed several other structures, among them the likewise faux-medieval summer residence Fjällhyddan, and his own would-be tomb. The area was once completely barren, but Malmgren – who was engaged in the tree-planting movement of that time – promised his wife Hilma that she would one day be able to walk beneath trees on Fjällsätern, and set about planting the thick forest of today. A nature reserve named after him, Ture Valleys, is situated on the mountain's eastern side.
