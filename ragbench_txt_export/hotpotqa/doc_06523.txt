Paul William George Hurry (born 9 April 1975 in Canterbury, Kent) is a British international motorcycle speedway rider. Hurry began his racing career aged 16 with the Arena Essex Hammers in 1991. In 1994 he became British under 21 champion and in 2000 he finished in second place at the British Speedway Championship. Hurry was selected to represent the Great Britain national speedway team at the 2001 Speedway World Cup Race-off but the team failed to reach the final. After spells with various British clubs, Hurry returned to Arena Essex in 2004, where he stayed until 2007. He appeared to have retired from racing in 2007 due to ongoing problems with an arm injury, but returned to Elite League racing in 2009 to replace the injured Kyle Legault for Poole Pirates. In 2010, Hurry returned to ride for his first club, now renamed the Lakeside Hammers. Paul suffered horrific leg injuries in the Final of the 2010 European Grasstrack Final at La Reole and didn't return to racing until 2015. In that time away from the sport he has become a member of the ACU Track Racing Committee and has also become a 'Clerk of the Course'. He has also become a prominent member of the Astra grasstrack club and help promote, run and officiate at meetings.
