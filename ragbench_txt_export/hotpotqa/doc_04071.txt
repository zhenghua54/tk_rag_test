The New Criterion is a New York-based monthly literary magazine and journal of artistic and cultural criticism, edited by Roger Kimball (editor and publisher) and James Panero (executive editor). It has sections for criticism of poetry, theater, art, music, the media, and books. It was founded in 1982 by Hilton Kramer, former art critic for "The New York Times", and Samuel Lipman, a pianist and music critic. The name is a reference to "The Criterion", a British literary magazine edited by T. S. Eliot from 1922 to 1939.
