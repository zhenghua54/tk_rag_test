The 2017–18 Philadelphia 76ers season will be the 79th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The 2017–18 76ers season will likely be the first time where their franchise's young core would play together with players like Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, and newly drafted point guard, Markelle Fultz with leading the way moving forward. Furthermore, during the 2016–17 season, the club was plagued with injury with Ben Simmons, Jahlil Okafor, Jerryd Bayless, Joel Embiid and Robert Covington. All five of them missed significant time. They would wind up acquiring the #1 pick again, this time being point guard Markelle Fultz from the Boston Celtics on June 19, four days before the 2017 NBA Draft began in exchange for their #3 pick this year (which was Jayson Tatum) and another first round pick moving forward. During the 2017–18 campaign, the Sixers look to build young core and have more of a legitimate change to a playoff run since Sam Hinkie's infamous tanking method.
