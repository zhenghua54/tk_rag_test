The Los Trigos Land Grant was established in the very early 19th century. The grant is situated on the Pecos River in San Miguel County, New Mexico about 29 miles south west of Santa Fe and 38 miles west of Las Vegas via I-25. The "communities" within the grant were Los Trigos itself, Pajarito and Las Ruedas. Of the three, only Pajarito remains with a few buildings visible from I-25 a couple of miles south of Rowe, New Mexico. The grant never had any other communities and itself was sandwiched between the Pecos Pueblo Indian Grant on the north and The San Miguel del Bado Land Grant on the South.
