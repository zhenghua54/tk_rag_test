Qvwm is a simple, lightweight window manager, which is intended to be a reimplementation of the Windows 95 interface for Linux systems. Released in 1996 under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), it features a start menu, a taskbar incorporating a system tray, and Windows-like task-switching. The project's name comes from wordplay references to Japanese words and Roman numbers. In 2000, "Linux Format" called Qvwm "an unusually impressive imposter".
