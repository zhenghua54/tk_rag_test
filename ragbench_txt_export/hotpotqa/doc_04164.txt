Milton Keynes Dons Football Club (usually abbreviated to MK Dons) is a professional association football club based in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, founded in 2004. The club was formed from Wimbledon F.C. after the latter had relocated to Milton Keynes. The club renamed itself as the 'Milton Keynes Dons' but subsequently considers itself to be a new club founded in 2004 (the club badge includes MMIV - Roman Numerals for 2004). They continued in Wimbledon's league place which, after relegation in the previous season, was in the 2004â€“05 Football League One. After two seasons in the third tier of English football they were relegated to the fourth tier (League Two). They were promoted in their second League Two season, as champions. Their second spell in League One lasted seven seasons, when in 2015, they finished in second place and therefore moved up to the Football League Championship. However in 2016, they were relegated back down to League One.
