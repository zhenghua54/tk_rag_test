The Hunsdiecker reaction (also called the Borodin reaction after Alexander Borodin) is the organic reaction of silver salts of carboxylic acids with halogens to give organic halides. It is an example of a halogenation reaction. The reaction is named after Heinz Hunsdiecker and Cl√§re Hunsdiecker, but was first noted by Borodin in 1861 when he prepared methyl bromide from silver acetate.
