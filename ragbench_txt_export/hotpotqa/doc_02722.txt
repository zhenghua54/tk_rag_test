Disney's Animated Storybook: 101 Dalmatians is the sixth entry in the "Disney's Animated Storybook" point-and-click adventure interactive storybook PC game series, based on theatrical and home video releases. This game was based on the Disney franchise of "One Hundred and One Dalmatians", which began with the 1961 film of the same name. Like that movie, the plot of the game sees villain and fashionista Cruella de Vil steal a series of dalmatian puppies from married couple Roger and Anita and their pets Pongo and Perdita, who then attempt to rescue them back. The game was developed by Media Station and published by Disney Interactive. It was released on March 18, 1997. The game is the only "Animated Storybook" title based on a Walt Disney Animation Studios film that was made before the Disney Renaissance (ignoring the two "Winnie the Pooh"-based titles).
