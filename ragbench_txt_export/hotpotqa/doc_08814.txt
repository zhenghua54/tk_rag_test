Prince Michael of Prussia (22 March 1940 â€“ 3 April 2014) was a member of the Hohenzollern dynasty which ruled Germany until the end of World War I. His great-grandfather William II was the German Emperor and King of Prussia until 1918. Although "Kaiser Wilhelm" died in exile and his family was stripped of much of its wealth and recognition of its rank and titles by the German Republic, he spent nearly all of his life in Germany.
