Carlene LeFevre is a competitive eater from Henderson, Nevada. She and her husband, Rich LeFevre, are said to form the "First Family of Competitive Eating" in spite of having normal weights and ages around 60, and are both top ranked members of the International Federation of Competitive Eating. The childless couple has combined to take two of the top seven places in Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2003, 2004, and 2005. She is nicknamed "The Madam of Etiquette" for her relative degree of decorum while consuming mass quantities of food quickly. Her trademark technique is called the "Carlene Pop," in which she bounces up and down while eating to get the food to settle.
