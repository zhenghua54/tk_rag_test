Brian Philip Welch (born June 19, 1970), better known by the stage name Head, is an American musician, singer and songwriter best known as one of the guitarists and co-founder of the nu metal band Korn and his solo project Love and Death. Along with fellow Korn guitarist James "Munky" Shaffer, Welch helped develop Korn's distinctive sound, a mix of sirenlike shards of dissonant guitar that mimicked a turntablist's various effects and rumbling down-tuned riffing, that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid-'90s.
