The Offspring is an American rock band from Garden Grove, California, formed in 1984. Originally formed under the name Manic Subsidal, the band has consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Dexter Holland, bassist Greg K., lead guitarist Kevin "Noodles" Wasserman and drummer Pete Parada since 2007. While Holland, Greg K., and Noodles have been constant members since the band was formed, the Offspring has gone through a number of drummers. Their longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who had been a member of The Offspring for 16 years; he was replaced by Atom Willard in 2003, and then four years later by Parada. The band is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, Bad Religion, NOFX, Pennywise and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, being considered one of the best-selling punk rock bands of all time.
