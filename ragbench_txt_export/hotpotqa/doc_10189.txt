In the 1970s, the Stovall Sisters were a gospel trio of recording artists consisting of Lillian, Netta, and Joyce Stovall. Definitive works include the album "The Stovall Sisters" (Reprise Records 1970, Warner Music Group) which included the now funk/soul classic “Hang on in There.” They are also the featured background vocalists on the rock classic “Spirit In The Sky” (recorded by Norman Greenbaum, producer, Erik Jacobsen).
