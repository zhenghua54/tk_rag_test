"The Prayer" is a song by English rock band Bloc Party. It was released as the lead single from their second studio album, "A Weekend in the City", except in the U.S. where it is the second single as "I Still Remember" was the first song from the album to be released in North America. It was released by Wichita Recordings on 29 January 2007 and is the band's highest charting single worldwide. The lyrics deal with drug use in nightclubs and party environments. Band frontman Kele Okereke says he was inspired to write the song after hearing Busta Rhymes' song "Touch It". He also described the song as having a "crunk-like" effect. A cover version of "The Prayer" by KT Tunstall is included in "Radio 1's Live Lounge â€“ Volume 2", and on her single "If Only".
