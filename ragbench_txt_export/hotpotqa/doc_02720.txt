102 Dalmatians is a 2000 American live action and CG-animated film adventure drama film directed by Kevin Lima in his live-action directorial debut and produced by Edward S. Feldman and Walt Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to the 1996 film "101 Dalmatians", a live-action remake of the 1961 Disney animated film of the same name and stars Glenn Close reprising her role as Cruella de Vil as she attempts to steal puppies for her "grandest" fur coat yet. Close and Tim McInnerny were the only two actors from the first film to return for the sequel, however. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, but lost to "Gladiator."
