The discography of B*Witched, an Irish pop girl group, consists of two studio album, one extended play and one compilation. The group released their debut single "C'est la Vie" on 25 May 1998. Despite mixed reviews, it reached Number 1 on the UK charts, making them the youngest female group ever to do so, and also made Number 9 in the US. Subsequent singles "Rollercoaster", "To You I Belong" and "Blame It on the Weatherman" also topped the UK charts. The group's debut album, "B*Witched", was released in October 1998, reaching Number 3 in the UK charts and was certified Double Platinum in the UK and Platinum in the US. B*Witched's second album, "Awake and Breathe", released almost exactly a year after their debut, peaked at Number 5 on the charts and was certified Platinum. Singles from the album were less successful than earlier releases ("Jesse Hold On" reached Number 4, "I Shall Be There" Number 13 and "Jump Down" Number 16 in the UK). The latter two appeared on their new American EP, "Across America 2000", along with live tracks and the earlier cover of "Does Your Mother Know". However, in September 2002, the group officially split when O'Carroll decided to leave the band.
