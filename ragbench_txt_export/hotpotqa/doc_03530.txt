Sam Duckworth is an English musician who performs as Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly. He is sometimes referred to as Get Cape, Cape, GCWCF and Slam Dunkworth (the latter title apparently first coined by Emmy The Great). According to Duckworth, his original stage name came from Retro Gamer magazine, from an article about superhero games such as "Batman" containing the heading "Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly". In addition to the Get Cape name, and his given name, Duckworth has released music under the moniker Recreations.
