Marine Fighting Squadron 221 (VMF-221) was a fighter squadron of the United States Marine Corps in World War II. During the war, they flew the Brewster F2A-3, and after reconstitution in 1943, the F4U Corsair. The squadron, also known as the “Fighting Falcons”, is most notable for its actions on June 4, 1942, during the Battle of Midway, which resulted in 23 members of the squadron, many posthumously, being awarded the Navy Cross for their actions in combat. VMF-221 ended WW II with 185 air-to-air victories, the second most of any Marine Fighting Squadron in the war.
