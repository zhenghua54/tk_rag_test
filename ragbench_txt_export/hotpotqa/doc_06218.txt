William Bradley "Brad" Bryant was appointed superintendent of public schools for the U.S. state of Georgia by Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2010, filling the vacancy left by the resignation of Kathy Cox. He considered a bid to run for superintendent as an independent in the 2010 election (filing for partisan primaries having passed before his appointment), but he failed to collect enough valid petition signatures to win a place on the general election ballot.
