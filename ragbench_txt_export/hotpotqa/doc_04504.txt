Vpered ("Forward" or "Hasten") (1909 - 1912) was an organization emanating from within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Russian Social Democracy or RSDLP). The faction was gathered by Alexander Bogdanov (1873 - 1928) in December 1909. The group included: Alexander Bogdanov, Maxim Gorky, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Grigory Aleksinsky, Stanislav Volski, and Martyn Liadov. Although Vpered emerged from the Bolshevik wing of Russian Social Democracy, the group was critical of Lenin.
