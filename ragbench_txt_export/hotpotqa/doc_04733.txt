"Stranger in Paradise" is a popular song from the musical "Kismet" (1953), and is credited to Robert Wright and George Forrest. Like almost all the music in that show, the melody was taken from music composed by Alexander Borodin (1833â€“1887), in this case, the "Gliding Dance of the Maidens", from the "Polovtsian Dances" in the opera "Prince Igor" (1890). The song in the musical is a lovers' duet and describes the transcendent feelings that love brings to their surroundings. Later versions were mostly edited to be sung by male solo artists.
