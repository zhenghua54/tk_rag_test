The boardwalk-themed launched roller coaster was designed by Ingenieur BÃ¼ro Stengel GmbH and was built by Intamin. California Screamin' is the eighth-longest rollercoaster in the world (and third-longest steel coaster in the United States), at 6072 ft long. It is also the longest ride with an inversion (since Son of Beast became defunct). Its highest point is 120 ft followed by a 108 ft drop. Though built of steel, the structure as designed visually mimics the features of a wooden coaster.
