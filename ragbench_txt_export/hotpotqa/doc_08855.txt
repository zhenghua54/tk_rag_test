Frederick J. Griffiths (December 11, 1878 - October 17, 1951) was an early, English-born engineer in the Stark County, Ohio steel industry. He is best known for working with Henry Ford to develop a vanadium alloy steel in order to produce lighter-weight, stronger automobiles. When the Massillon Rolling Mill Company merged into the Central Steel Company in June 1914, Griffiths resigned as a chemist at Cantonâ€™s United Steel Company to become Central's vice president and superintendent. He then became the president of the company. His daughter, Gertrude, lit the first open hearth furnace at the new Central Steel Company in 1915. In 1917, Griffith's was named to the Massillon Steel Casting Company board of directors. The company's earliest orders came from the United States military for production of the steel-rated equipment and supplies needed for World War I. By 1919, 3 of his 5 brothers were all superintendents at Central Steel.
