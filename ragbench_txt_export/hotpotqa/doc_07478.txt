The family tree of the Egyptian Nineteenth dynasty is the usual mixture of conjecture and interpretation. The family history starts with the appointment of Ramesses I as the successor to Horemheb, the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty who had no heirs. From Ramesses' line came perhaps the greatest king of the New Kingdom of Egypt, Ramesses II. He ruled for nearly 67 years and had many children (see List of children of Ramses II).
