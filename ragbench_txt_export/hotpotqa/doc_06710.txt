Landwehr, or Landeswehr, is a German language term used in referring to certain national armies, or militias found in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe. In different context it refers to large-scale, low-strength fortifications. In German, the word means "defence of the country"; but the term as applied to an insurrectional militia is very ancient, and "lantveri" are mentioned in "Baluzii Capitularia", as quoted in Hallam's "Middle Ages", i. 262, 10th edition.
