G-Unit Films and Television Inc. is an American film and television production company founded by rapper 50 Cent and Interscope in 2003. In 2008, 50 Cent stated in an interview that he has created his own independent film production company with Randall Emmett called Cheetah Vision, technically scrapping G-Unit Films. In 2010, Jackson revived G-Unit Films, renaming the company to G-Unit Films and Television Inc. The company has joint ventures with Will Packer’s production company Will Packer Productions and Universal Television. In over 18 months, Jackson has sold projects to six different networks. Among them was "Power", a STARZ drama in which he not only co-stars but also serves as co-creator and executive producer. “Power” debuted in June 2014 and was renewed for a second season after one episode. “Power’s” August 2 season finale garnered the high ratings through the season, more than doubling the premiere and it generated 71% of the African-American viewership of any scripted premium series since 2006. Jackson serves as a co‐star, co-creator and executive television producer of the STARZ network drama where he signed a 2 year contract with representation coming from the Agency for the Performing Arts. Ratings have been a success for Starz. with the second season premiere being the highest-ever season with 1.43 million people tuning in live. Jackson also serves as an executive television producer for "Dream School" for SundanceTV, a series that follows fifteen high school dropouts as they are taught by a series of celebrity "teachers".
