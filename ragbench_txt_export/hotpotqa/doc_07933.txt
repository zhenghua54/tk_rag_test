Jeongol is a Korean-style hot pot made by putting meat, mushroom, seafood, seasoning, etc., in a stew pot, adding broth, and boiling it. It is similar to the category of Korean stews called "jjigae", with the main difference being that "jjigae" are generally made with only a single main ingredient, and named after that ingredient (such as "kimchi jjigae" or "sundubu jjigae"), while "jeongol" usually contain a variety of main ingredients. An additional difference is that "jeongol" (like "gujeolpan") was originally a dish for upper-class Koreans and members of the royal court, while "jjigae" was a simpler dish for commoners.
