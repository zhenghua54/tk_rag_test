Moravian Duets (in Czech: "Moravské dvojzpěvy" ) by Antonín Dvořák is a cycle of 23 Moravian folk poetry settings for two voices with piano accompaniment, composed between 1875 and 1881. The Duets, published in three volumes, Op. 20 (B. 50), Op. 32 (B. 60 and 62), and Op. 38 (B. 69), occupy an important position among Dvořák's other works. The fifteen duets of Op. 32 are the most famous part of the cycle. Popular interest in the "Moravian Duets" was the starting point for subsequent works which propelled Dvořák to international fame.
