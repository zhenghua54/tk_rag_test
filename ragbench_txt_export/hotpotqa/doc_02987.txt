The Goal of the Year is a competition for the best goals kicked in the VFL/AFL during that season. It is run in conjunction with the Mark of the Year competition and is currently sponsored by Coates Hire. The award is also known as the Phil Manassa Medal. The concept is thought to have been initiated as an unofficial award in 1970 by media interests after Alex Jesaulenko's famous mark. The official award was first given in 2001.
