Bruster's Ice Cream is an American chain of ice cream parlors whose ice cream and frozen yogurt is made from a milk-based mix at each individual store. Their primary operating region is in most states east of the Mississippi River. The chain is based in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bridgewater, Pennsylvania. All of the ice cream is made fresh in the stores in order to avoid ice crystal formation. The recipe book that Bruster's uses consists of over 170 recipes with many seasonal favorites. Bruster's also makes a variety of handmade ice cream cakes as well as homemade waffle cones. It recently started a Facebook site showing local deals and locations.
