Lincoln green is the colour of dyed woollen cloth associated with Robin Hood and his merry men in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The dyers of Lincoln, a cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the cloth by dyeing it with woad ("Isatis tinctoria") to give it a strong blue, then overdyeing it yellow with weld ("Reseda luteola") or dyers' broom, "Genista tinctoria". "Coventry blue" and "Kendall green" were also colours linked with the dyers of English towns.
