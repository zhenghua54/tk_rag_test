Peter Albert David Singer, AC (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher. He is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. He specializes in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He is known in particular for his book "Animal Liberation" (1975), in which he argues in favor of vegetarianism, and his essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," in which he argues in favor of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a preference utilitarian, but he announced in "The Point of View of the Universe (2014)", coauthored with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, that he had become a hedonistic utilitarian.
