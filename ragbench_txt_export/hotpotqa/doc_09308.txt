The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a 2006 Holocaust novel by Irish novelist John Boyne. Unlike the months of planning Boyne devoted to his other books, he said that he wrote the entire first draft of " The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas" in two and a half days, barely sleeping until he got to the end. As of March 2010, the novel had sold more than five million copies around the world. In both 2007 and 2008, it was the best selling book of the year in Spain, and it has also reached number one on the "New York Times" bestseller list, as well as in the UK, Ireland, and Australia. The book was adapted in 2008 as a film of the same name.
