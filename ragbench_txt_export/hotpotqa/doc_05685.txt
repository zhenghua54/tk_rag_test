Don Oliver Newland (1896–1951) was an American film director and producer whose career consisted largely of itinerant work. From the 1920s until his death, he traveled to cities throughout the United States making films that employed local citizens as stars and extras. Using a standard script, Newland personalized each film according to its location – "Belvidere's Hero", "Staunton's Hero", "Janesville's Hero", "Huntingdon's Hero", "Tyrone's Hero", "Wilmington's Hero", and so on.
