In mathematics, specifically in the theory of Markovian stochastic processes in probability theory, the Chapmanâ€“Kolmogorov equation is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process. The equation was derived independently by both the British mathematician Sydney Chapman and the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.
