The Type 88 Surface-to-Ship Missile (88式地対艦誘導弾, SSM-1) is a truck-mounted anti-ship missile developed by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in the late 1980s. It is a land-based version of the air-launched Type 80 (ASM-1) missile; in turn it was developed into the ship-launched Type 90 (SSM-1B) missile. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force bought 54 transporter erector launchers, each carrying six Type 88 missiles, for use as coastal batteries. With a range of 180 km , high subsonic speed and 225 kg warhead, it is similar to the US Harpoon missile.
