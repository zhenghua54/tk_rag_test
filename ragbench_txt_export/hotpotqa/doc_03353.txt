Roadmaster is a country rock album by Gene Clark released in 1973. The album was compiled from various unreleased recordings for A&M Records made in 1970 through 1972. Eight tracks yielded from an April 1972 recording session featuring Clarence White, Chris Ethridge, Spooner Oldham, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Byron Berline and Michael Clarke; two tracks ("One in A Hundred" and "She's the Kind of Girl") derived from an unissued single reassembling the five original Byrds prior to their 1973 reunion album; and the remaining track, "Here Tonight", had been recorded with The Flying Burrito Brothers. Initially released in the Netherlands and Germany only on the A&M subsidiary Ariola, it was reissued on compact disc for the American market in 1994.
