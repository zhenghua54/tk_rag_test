Since their recent restoration, the six organs in the Basilica of the Palace of Mafra have become widely known around the world. The six instruments - designed and built all at the same time, and designed to play together as well - were built by the two most important Portuguese organ builders of the time – António Xavier Machado e Cerveira and Joaquim António Peres Fontanes – and were completed between 1806 and 1807. The last two were inaugurated on 4 October 1807, and a substantial number of compositions involving all six organs were produced that year.
