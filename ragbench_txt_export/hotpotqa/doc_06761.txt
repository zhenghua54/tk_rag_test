The Omukama of Toro is the name given to rulers of the East African kingdom of Toro. The kingdom lasted as an independent state from the 16th to the 19th century. Although no longer the ruler of a state, the Omukama of Toro remains an important figure in Ugandan politics, especially among the Toro people of whom he is the titular head. He is closely related to the Omukama of Bunyoro.
