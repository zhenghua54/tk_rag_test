The Palace of Music ("Zenepalota") is a building in Bartók square, Miskolc, Hungary. It is the building of the Béla Bartók Secondary School and the Béla Bartók Music Institute (a faculty of the University of Miskolc.) The Palace was designed by Gyula Waelder in Neo-baroque style and was built between 1926 and 1927. The construction was financed from USA loans, just like that of the Hotel Palace in Lillafüred and the Market Hall on Búza tér.
