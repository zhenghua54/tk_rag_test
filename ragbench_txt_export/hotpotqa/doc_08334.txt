Antonino "Nino" Rotolo (born January 3, 1946) is an Italian Mafia boss from the Pagliarelli area in Palermo that traditionally was under the control of the Motisi Mafia family. Rotolo was the underboss of Matteo Motisi, but according to some pentiti he was the "de facto" leader representing the mandamento on the Sicilian Mafia Commission. In 2006, the police deduced that Rotolo - number 25 in the numbered code of Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano - had become a key figure in Cosa Nostra's hierarchy.
