The submarino (meaning ""submarine"" in Spanish) or remo (meaning ""oar"") is a beverage traditionally drunk in Argentina and Uruguay. It consists of a bar of dark chocolate melted inside a glass of hot milk and stirred with a long spoon (similar to an iced tea spoon) until the chocolate is completely dissolved.
