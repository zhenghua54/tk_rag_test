The Dubrovniks were an Australian rock band which formed in August 1986 as The Adorable Ones. Early in 1987 they changed their name, which acknowledges two of their founders, Roddy Radalj and Boris Sujdovic, birthplace in Dubrovnik, a town in Croatia. Both Radalj and fellow founder James Baker had also founded Hoodoo Gurus (as Le Hoodoo Gurus) in 1981. All three had earlier associations in the Perth punk scene of the late 1970s. The group issued four albums, "Dubrovnik Blues" (August 1989), "Audio Sonic Love Affair" (September 1990), "Chrome" (June 1992), and "Medicine Wheel" (1994), before disbanding in 1995.
