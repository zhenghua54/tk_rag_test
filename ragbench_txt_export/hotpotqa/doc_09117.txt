California Hot Rod Reunion is a gathering of drag racers, hot rod enthusiasts and street rodders held in Bakersfield, California. The event was created by Steve Gibbs, vice-president of the National Hot Rod Association, in October 1992, as a one-time event to gather some of the old drag racers together. It has since become an annual event in early October at Auto Club Famoso Raceway outside Bakersfield. It has also spawned the National Hot Rod Reunion, held each year in Bowling Green KY. Honorees are named at each year's reunion. The Honorees are pioneers in the sport of drag racing and hot rodding. The 25th annual event, presented by AAA and associate sponsor Good Vibrations Motorsports, will be held Oct 21-23, 2016.
