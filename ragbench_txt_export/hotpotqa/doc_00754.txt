Doris ( ; Δωρίς "bounty"), an Oceanid, was a sea nymph in Greek mythology, whose name represented the bounty of the sea. She was the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys and the wife of Nereus. She was also aunt to Atlas, the titan who was made to carry the sky upon his shoulders, whose mother Clymene was a sister of Doris. Doris was mother to Nerites and the fifty Nereids, including Thetis, who was the mother of Achilles, and Amphitrite, Poseidon's wife, and mother of Triton.
