Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK) (English: Armed Forces' Special Command ) is a special operations forces unit of the Norwegian Special Operation Forces (Norwegian: "Forsvarets Spesialstyrker" ). The unit was established in 1982 due to the increased risk of terrorist activity against Norwegian interests, including the oil platforms in the North Sea.
