Joey Slutman, also known as Joe Annaruma, was GWAR's second vocalist while Oderus Urungus – Dave Brockie – was the 2nd guitarist. Joey Slutman is the vocalist on the first four songs on "Let There Be GWAR". Before joining Gwar in 1985, he was guitarist for the Norfolk, VA hardcore punk band JUDICIAL FEAR from 1980–1984. As opposed to the early style of Oderus, which featured Brockie singing in his regular (non-Oderus) voice, Joey Slutman had a deep growling voice. From 1989 to 1993, he was vocalist and guitarist in the Philadelphia band Throttle, recording one cassette-only release titled "FREAKS" on Knucklehead Records in 1989, and a 7" EP titled "New Freaks on the Block" in 1991, on Heat Blast records. Throttle reformed in 2008, playing local Philadelphia shows for charity events, playing their final show in July 2010. He is currently playing in the band Man is Doomed in Philadelphia, PA.
