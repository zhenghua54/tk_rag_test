In Major League Soccer, several teams annually compete for secondary rivalry cups that are usually contested by only two teams, with the only exception being the Cascadia Cup, which is contested by three teams. Each cup or trophy is awarded to the eligible team with the better regular season record and are comparable to minor trophies played for in college football rivalries. Most cups are deliberately conceived as local derbies between teams in the same region. Rivalry cups are considered a tradition to most MLS fans and players alike. Out of the ten original MLS teams only three have not competed in these rivalry cups: Sporting K.C., New England Revolution and the defunct Tampa Bay Mutiny. Most newer local derbies such as the 401 Derby and Hudson River Derby are not contested for rivalry cups but instead for bragging rights of rival supporters groups. The only rivalry between two original MLS clubs that do not compete for a cup is the San Jose Earthquakes and the LA Galaxy in the yearly edition of the California Clasico. The Texas Derby are the only MLS cup rivalry games where the winner does not walk away with a cup trophy. Instead, the winner takes home "El Capit√°n" a replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon.
