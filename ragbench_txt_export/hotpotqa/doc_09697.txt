The Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, or Nordita (Danish: "Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk (Atom)fysik" ), is an international organisation for research in theoretical physics. It was established in 1957 by Niels Bohr and the Swedish minister Torsten Gustafsson. Nordita was originally located at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen (Denmark), but moved to the AlbaNova University Centre in Stockholm (Sweden) on 1 January 2007. The main research areas at Nordita are astrophysics, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and high-energy physics.
