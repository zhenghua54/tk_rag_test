Scott Weiland and the Wildabouts (sometimes billed simply as The Wildabouts) were a rock and roll band formed sometime around 2012 by former Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver lead singer Scott Weiland, along with bassist Tommy Baker, guitarist Jeremy Brown, and multi-instrumentalist Doug Grean. The Wildabouts were marred with several roster changes (including the death of guitarist Jeremy Brown) and ultimately disbanded after Weiland's sudden death on a tour bus in late 2015.
