Snow White's Scary Adventures is a dark ride at the Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris) theme parks, and formerly the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort. Located in Fantasyland, it is one of the few remaining attractions that was operational on Disneyland's opening day in 1955 (although the present version of the attraction opened in 1983). The ride was also one of the few rides that was operational since opening day in Walt Disney World Resort. The ride's story is based on Disney's 1937 film, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", their first animated feature film.
