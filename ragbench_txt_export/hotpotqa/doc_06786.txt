The Iliupersis (Greek: Ἰλίου πέρσις , "Iliou persis", "Sack of Ilium"), also known as The Sack of Troy, is a lost epic of ancient Greek literature. It was one of the Epic Cycle, that is, the "Trojan" cycle, which told the entire history of the Trojan War in epic verse. The story of the "Iliou persis" comes chronologically after that of the "Little Iliad", and is followed by the "Nostoi" ("Returns"). The "Iliou persis" was sometimes attributed by ancient writers to Arctinus of Miletus (see Cyclic poets). The poem comprised two books of verse in dactylic hexameter.
