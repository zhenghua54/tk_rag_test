"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh. Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that "The House at Pooh Corner" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day". That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song. The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release "Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh". "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" opens up the 2000 release of "The Tigger Movie". In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song.
