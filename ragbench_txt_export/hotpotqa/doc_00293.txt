Côtes de Gascogne is a wine-growing district in Gascony producing principally white wine. It is mainly located in the département of the Gers in the French region Midi-Pyrénées, and it belongs to the wine region South West France. The designation Côtes de Gascogne is used for a "Vin de Pays" ("country wine") produced in the Armagnac area. The decree of 13 September 1968 created the difference between a "Vin de Pays" and simpler table wine, the so-called "Vin de table". The designation "Côtes de Gascogne" obliges the producers to respect the stricter rules and production standards, which were adopted with the decree of 25 January 1982.
