Education in the British Virgin Islands is largely free and is a requirement for children ages 5 to 17. The British Virgin Islands has a total of 15 public primary schools and 4 secondary public schools. In addition to the public schools, there are 10 primary private schools and 3 secondary private schools. The School year is from September to June. The British Virgin Islands is a part of the British Overseas Territories and therefore the educational system is very similar to the traditional learning system in the United Kingdom. Primary schools are focused on establishing the basics of an academic curriculum and host students between the ages of 5 to 12. After the completion of Primary school, students move on to Secondary school. Secondary school is for students between the ages of 13 and 17. Following the completion of secondary education, students may write their Caribbean secondary education certificate examination. There are approximately 2,700 students who attend primary school for the first 7 years of their required education, however less than 1,800 students successfully finish the following 5 required years of secondary school and complete their certificate exam. Tertiary Education is by no means required in the British Virgin Islands. Students who chose to continue their education after Secondary Education may move on to an additional 2 years of schooling. After 2 years of Tertiary Education is completed, students may take their Caribbean advanced placement examinations. Passing the exams entitles students the right to continue their studies even further at the University of the Virgin Island. This University is the only tertiary education institution in the British Virgin Islands. At the University, students can obtain associate, bachelors, and master's degrees in the departments of business, education, liberal arts and social sciences, or science and mathematic.
