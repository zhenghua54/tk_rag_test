On 6 February 2017, the Sapphire Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, marking sixty-five years of her reign, occurred. The longest-reigning monarch in British history, Queen Elizabeth II was the first British monarch to have a sapphire jubilee. This Jubilee featured blue stamps from the Royal Mail, commemorative coins from the Royal Mint, and a reissue of an official 2014 portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by David Bailey. In this official portrait the Queen wears sapphire jewellery which she received as a wedding present from her father. The Jubilee also involved a gun salute at the Tower of London, a gun salute in Green Park, gun salutes in several other places around the United Kingdom, and the ringing of the bells in Westminster Abbey. Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, congratulated Queen Elizabeth II in regard to the occasion, saying in part, "I know the nation will join with me today in celebrating and giving thanks for the lifetime of service Her Majesty the Queen has given to our country and to the Commonwealth."
