The sixth season of Nouvelle Star aired from February 31 to June 13, 2008. Virginie Efira hosted her third season. Novelties of the season were brought with a change in the judging panel as André Manoukian remained as the only former jury member. Next to him, Lio, Sinclair and Philippe Manœuvre judged the contestants for the first time. Also a veto power was introduced in which the judges had the right to save an eliminated contestant which they used at their very first opportunity. A similar element was later seen in the eighth season of "American Idol".
