Shinola LLC is an American luxury lifestyle brand which specializes in watches, bicycles, and leather goods among other items. Founded in 2011, its name is a nod to the former Shinola shoe polish company that operated in the early- and mid-20th century. The current company is owned and operated by Bedrock Brands, a privately owned Texas investment group, and was launched by Tom Kartsotis, one of the founders of the Fossil Group retail conglomerate.
