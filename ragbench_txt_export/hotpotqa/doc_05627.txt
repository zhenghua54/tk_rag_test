Catherine Anahid Berberian (July 4, 1925 â€“ March 6, 1983) was an American mezzo-soprano and composer based in Italy. She interpreted contemporary avant-garde music composed, among others, by Luciano Berio, Bruno Maderna, John Cage, Henri Pousseur, Sylvano Bussotti, Darius Milhaud, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, and Igor Stravinsky. She also interpreted works by Claudio Monteverdi, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Kurt Weill, Philipp Zu Eulenburg, arrangements of songs by The Beatles, and folk songs from several countries and cultures. As a composer, she wrote "Stripsody" (1966), in which she exploits her vocal technique using comic book sounds (onomatopoeia), and "Morsicat(h)y" (1969), a composition for the keyboard (with the right hand only) based on Morse code.
