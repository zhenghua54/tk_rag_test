Natalie Sorokin (born 1926), a French woman, had affairs with Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. In June 1943 Sorokin's mother complained to the school authorities that De Beauvoir had led her daughter astray. De Beauvoir was accused of behavior leading to the corruption of a minor and her teaching license was suspended for the rest of her life. Sorokin later said her relationship with De Beauvoir and Sartre came to an end when she found this relationship serving only one part. She then started writing and worked for radio.
