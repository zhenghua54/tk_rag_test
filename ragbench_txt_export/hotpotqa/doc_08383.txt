Chaminade High School is a Roman Catholic college preparatory high school for boys in Mineola, New York, United States. The school was founded in 1930 by the Society of Mary (Marianists), an international Roman Catholic teaching order of priests and religious brothers. The school is named after William Joseph Chaminade, S.M. (1761â€“1850), who founded the Marianist order in 1817, and who was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2000. Operated by the Marianists, Chaminade is independent of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre. The student body numbers over 1,700, mostly from Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as neighboring New York City. The administration and faculty consists of both Marianists and lay men and women.
