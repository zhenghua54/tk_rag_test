Testosterone phenylpropionate (BAN) (brand name Testolent), or testosterone phenpropionate, also known as testosterone hydrocinnamate, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β phenylpropionate ester of testosterone – which was formerly marketed in Romania. It was first reported in the scientific literature in 1955 and was an ingredient of several isolated AAS commercial products, but was never widely used. Testosterone phenylpropionate was also notably a component of Sustanon and Omnadren.
