The Hitler Cabinet "de jure" formed the government of Nazi Germany between 30 January 1933 and 30 April 1945 upon the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of the German Reich by president Paul von Hindenburg â€“ contrived by the national conservative politician Franz von Papen, who reserved the office of the Vice-Chancellor for himself. Originally Hitler's first cabinet was called "the Reich Cabinet of national salvation", which was a coalition of Hitler's Nazi Party and the national conservative German National People's Party, it became an exclusively Nazi cabinet when the DNVP was intimidated into dissolving itself.
