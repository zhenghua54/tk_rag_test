Air Bud: Golden Receiver (also known as Air Bud 2) is the 1998 sequel to "Air Bud". The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is also the last of the "Air Bud" films to be released theatrically. Outside the United States the film was often titled "Air Bud 2". This film is dedicated in memory of the original Air Bud (Air Buddy), who died of Synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects soft tissue near the joints of the arm, leg, or neck in 1998, just several months before the movie's release.
