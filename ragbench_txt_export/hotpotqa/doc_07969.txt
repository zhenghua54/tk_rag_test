The Philip K. Dick Reader is a collection of science fiction stories by American writer Philip K. Dick. It was first published by Citadel Twilight in 1997. Many of the stories had originally appeared in the magazines "If", "Science Fiction Adventures", "Science Fiction Stories", "Orbit", "Fantasy and Science Fiction", "Imagination", "Future", "Galaxy Science Fiction", "Beyond Fantasy Fiction", "Satellite", "Imaginative Tales", "Fantastic Universe" and "Space Science Fiction". It is identical in content and order to the edition of volume 3 of the Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick produced by the same publisher apart from the substitution of three stories in positions 21-23 of 24 and the omission of the end notes in the Collected Stories edition. At press time, stories 21 and 24 had already been made into successful movie adaptations and stories 22 and 23 had been optioned.
