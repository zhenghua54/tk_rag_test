"Firm Biz" is the first single by the Hip hop supergroup The Firm from their singular collaborative LP "The Album". The song was produced by L.E.S, who based the song's track on a sample of Teena Marie's 1981 hit "Square Biz". "Firm Biz" also features a chorus performed by former En Vogue singer Dawn Robinson, reworked from the "Square Biz" chorus. AZ raps the first verse of the song, Nas the second, and Foxy Brown the third and final verse. The song never reached any US chart positions, but was a UK Top 20 hit in 1997. A remix of the song was released, featuring a verse from Half-A-Mill and a chorus by Mary J. Blige. The word "feds" is censored in the explicit version, in verse 2, performed by Nas, when he says "Never that though Black .4-4's for feds".
