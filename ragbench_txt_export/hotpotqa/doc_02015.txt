Flaw is an American rock band from Louisville, Kentucky. The band was formed by guitarist Jason Daunt in 1996. After a string of rough independent recordings in the 1990s, the band signed to Republic/Universal Records and released two major label albums, "Through the Eyes" in 2001 and "Endangered Species" in 2004. Breakups, line-up changes, and internal strife plagued the band for the rest of the decade, though as of 2015, the band reformed with three of their core members for touring and writing music. The band released their fourth studio album, "Divided We Fall", on August 19, 2016.
