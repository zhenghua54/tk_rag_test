"Beyond Blunderdome" is the eleventh season premiere of the American animated sitcom "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1999, and was watched in around 8.1Â million homes during the broadcast. In the episode, the Simpsons are given free tickets to a preview screening of Mel Gibson's new film, a remake of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". Gibson laments his current non-violent role and wants someone to give him criticism. When Homer sees Gibson talking with Marge, he gives him a brutal review, leading Gibson to believe that Homer is the only man brave enough to give suggestions. As a result, he hires him to create a better ending. However, when the ending proves to be too controversial, Gibson and Homer end up on the run from studio executives with the film.
