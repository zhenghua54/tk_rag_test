La fanciulla del West ("The Girl of the West") is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by and , based on the play "The Girl of the Golden West" by the American author David Belasco. "Fanciulla" followed "Madama Butterfly", which was also based on a Belasco play. The opera has fewer of the show-stopping highlights that are characteristic of other Puccini works, but is admired for its impressive orchestration and for a score that is more melodically integrated than is typical of his previous work. "Fanciulla" displays influences from composers Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, without being in any way imitative. Similarities between the libretto and the work of Richard Wagner have also been found, though some attribute this more to the original plot of the play, and have asserted that the opera remains quintessentially Italian.
