Sylvia, originally Sylvia, ou La nymphe de Diane, is a full-length ballet in two or three acts, first choreographed by Louis Mérante to music by Léo Delibes in 1876. "Sylvia" is a typical classical ballet in many respects, yet it has many interesting features that make it unique. "Sylvia" is notable for its mythological Arcadian setting, creative choreographies, expansive sets and, above all, its remarkable score.
