The Killer World Tour was a concert tour by the heavy metal band Iron Maiden from 17 February 1981 to 15 November 1981. This would be the band's first world tour, including their debut shows in North America (where they supported Judas Priest on their World Wide Blitz Tour and UFO on select dates) and Japan where they recorded the live release, "Maiden Japan". On top of this, the band moved into larger venues in the United Kingdom, including the Hammersmith Odeon, London.
