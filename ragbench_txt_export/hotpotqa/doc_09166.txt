Cyborg 2, released in some countries as Glass Shadow, is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Michael Schroeder and starring Elias Koteas, Angelina Jolie, Billy Drago, Karen Sheperd and Jack Palance. It is an unrelated sequel to the 1989 film "Cyborg", although footage from the original is used in a dream sequence. It was also Jolie's film debut in a starring role (she had previously made an earlier film, "Lookin' to Get Out", as a child actress). It was followed by the 1995 direct-to-video release "".
