Truman W. "True" Williams (March 22, 1839 â€“ November 23, 1897) was an American artist known as the most prolific illustrator to Mark Twain's books and novels. He drew all illustrations to the first edition of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" (1876) and was thus the first to illustrate such characters as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He was also sole illustrator of Twain's "Sketches, New and Old" and primary illustrator of "Roughing It" and "The Innocents Abroad". Working with a number of publishers he also illustrated works by writers Bill Nye, George W. Peck, Joaquin Miller, and others. His style in "Tom Sawyer" influenced E. W. Kemble's work in his illustrations to "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (1884).
