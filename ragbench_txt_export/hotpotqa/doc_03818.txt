Lehigh University Press is the publishing house of Lehigh University. Lehigh's university press was a member of the Associated University Presses consortium; other members included Bucknell University Press, University of Delaware Press, Susquehanna University Press and Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. When Associated University Presses ceased most new publishing in 2010, a new distribution agreement between Lehigh University Press, Bucknell University Press, University of Delaware Press, and Fairleigh Dickinson University Press was struck with Rowman & Littlefield.
