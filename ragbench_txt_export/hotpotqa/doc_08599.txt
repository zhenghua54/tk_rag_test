He was the chief developer of IFM during World War II. One of Wocke's major work was the development of the Junkers Ju 287 wing design since autumn 1942. Wocke was sent to Moscow in 1946 together with Brunolf Baade and projected the EF131 to EF150 there. In 1954 Wocke returned to the German Democratic Republic, moving to West Germany shortly afterwards and joining Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) as their chief designer. In Hamburg, Wocke completed work on the HFB-320 business jet, whose wings were forward swept, a design Wocke transferred from the Junkers Ju287 in the early 1960s.
