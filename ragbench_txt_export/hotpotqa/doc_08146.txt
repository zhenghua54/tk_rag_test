The 1990–91 NBA season was the Rockets' 24th season in the National Basketball Association, and 20th season in the city of Houston. In the offseason, the Rockets acquired Kenny Smith from the Atlanta Hawks. The Rockets continued to play .500 basketball during the first half of the season as Hakeem Olajuwon missed 26 games due to injuries. However, the Rockets showed improvement by posting a 14–1 record in March, which included a 13-game winning streak. They finished third in the Midwest Division with a 52–30 record. Smith provided a spark averaging 17.7 points per game, while Vernon Maxwell averaged 17.0 points per game and led the league with 172 three-point field goals. Head coach Don Chaney was named Coach of The Year. However, in the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets were swept by the Los Angeles Lakers in three straight games.
