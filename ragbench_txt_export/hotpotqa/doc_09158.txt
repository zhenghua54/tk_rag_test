The Thomas Mann House at 1550 San Remo Drive in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, was designed by the modernist architect JR Davidson for the exiled German writer Thomas Mann in 1941. Mann lived at the house between 1942 and 1952 before his emigration to Switzerland, where he spent the last three years of his life. The house was sold by Mann to an American lawyer and his wife, and remained in their family until its 2016 purchase by the German government. A restoration of the house is planned, and it is intended that the house will become an artist's residence, like the nearby Villa Aurora, the home of fellow German exile Lion Feuchtwanger.
