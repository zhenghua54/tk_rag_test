The Camelot Hotel/Casino was a proposed hotel and casino that was to be built in the early 1980s in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The site of the proposed project was located in the marina district, adjacent to Harrahs Resort, and was to consist of 990 hotel rooms and a 60,000 sq ft casino. Entertainer Merv Griffin was appointed as entertainment director of the company and planned to broadcast his television show from the hotel. However, because of financial, political and legal difficulties, construction of the hotel/casino was never completed and a casino license was never issued.
