Iago is a fictional supporting character in the animated "Aladdin" films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Company. He is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried and appeared in the first film as the sidekick to the main villain Jafar, and later becomes one of the protagonists for the rest of the franchise's run. The red-plumed talking scarlet macaw is an apparent homage to an identically-named red parrot in the Tintin adventure "The Castafiore Emerald".
