Giovanni Fusco (10 October 1906, Sant'Agata dei Goti, Benevento â€“ 31 May 1968, Rome) was an Italian composer, pianist and conductor, who has written numerous film scores since 1936, including those of Alain Resnais's "Hiroshima mon amour" (1959) and "La guerre est finie" (1966), as well as of most of the 1948-1964 films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, from "N.U." ("Nettezza Urbana") to "Il deserto rosso", except for "La notte" (soundtrack by Giorgio Gaslini) and some of his early short films. Two of his soundtracks, those of Antonioni's "Cronaca di un amore" and "L'avventura", won Silver Ribbon for the best film score from Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists in 1951 and 1961, respectively.
