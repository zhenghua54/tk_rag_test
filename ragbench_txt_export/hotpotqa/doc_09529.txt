"Without You" is the second single released on 13 May 2002 by Australian rock band Silverchair from their fourth album, "Diorama", issued in March that year (see 2002 in music). It was written in Db major by lead singer-guitarist Daniel Johns and was composed during the recording sessions for the band's third album "Neon Ballroom" (1999) but was not used at that time.
