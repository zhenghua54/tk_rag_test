Yakuza, known in Japan as Ryū ga Gotoku (龍が如く , "Like a Dragon") , is an open world action-adventure beat 'em up video game franchise created, owned and published by Sega. The series originated from Toshihiro Nagoshi's desire to create a game that would tell the way of life of the "yakuza". Nagoshi initially struggled to find a platform for the project, until Sony showed interest in the prospect.
