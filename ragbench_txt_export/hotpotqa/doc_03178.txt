Edward Joseph Leonski (December 12, 1917 â€“ November 9, 1942) was an American soldier and serial killer responsible for the strangling murders of three women in Melbourne, Australia. Leonski was known as the "Brownout Strangler", given Melbourne's wartime status of keeping low lighting (not as stringent as a wartime blackout). His self-confessed motive for the killings was a twisted fascination with female voices, especially when they were singing, and his claim that he killed the women to "get at their voices."
