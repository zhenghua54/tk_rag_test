ApeXtreme (pronounced 'A-peks-schreem') is a cancelled video game console that was developed by Apex Digital. While the console made a promising first appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2004, it had been cancelled by December of that year. The console was based on VIA's Glory Personal Gaming Console Platform, and would have included a keyboard, mouse, game controller and a remote control.
