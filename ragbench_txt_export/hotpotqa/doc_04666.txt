James Bateman (18 July 1811 – 27 November 1897) was a British landowner and accomplished horticulturist. He developed Biddulph Grange after moving there around 1840, from nearby Knypersley Hall in Staffordshire, England. He created the famous gardens at Biddulph with the aid of his friend and painter of seascapes Edward William Cooke. From 1865–70 he was president of the North Staffordshire Field Club, the large local club which researched in local natural history and folklore.
