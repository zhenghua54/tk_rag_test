"If You've Got Trouble" is a song written by Lennonâ€“McCartney and recorded by the Beatles on 18 February 1965 with Ringo Starr singing the lead vocal. The song was intended to be Starr's vocal appearance on the "Help!" album and the "Help!" film, but the Beatles were not happy with the recording and later chose "Act Naturally" (which is not in the film) instead. "If You've Got Trouble" remained unreleased until "Anthology 2" in 1996.
