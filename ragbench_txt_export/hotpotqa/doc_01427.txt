Within the broad movement of new-age music, neoclassical new-age music is influenced by and sometimes also based upon early, baroque or classical music, especially in terms of melody and composition. The artist may offer a modern arrangement of a work by an established composer or combine elements from classical styles with modern elements to produce original compositions. Many artists within this subgenre are classically trained musicians. Although there is a wide variety of individual styles, neoclassical new-age music is generally melodic, harmonic, and instrumental, using both traditional musical instruments as well as electronic instruments. Similar neoclassical elements can often be found within other genres besides new-age music, including electronic music, minimalist music, post-rock music and neoclassical dark wave music.
