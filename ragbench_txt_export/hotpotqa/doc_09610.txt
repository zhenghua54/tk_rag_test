Whaling in Australia commenced in 1791 when two of the ships which had brought convicts and free settlers to the penal colony of New South Wales (Australia) as part of the Third Fleet engaged in whaling and seal hunting activities before returning to England. The main varieties of whales hunted were humpback, blue, right and sperm whales.
