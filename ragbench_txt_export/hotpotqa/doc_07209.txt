La Esperanza (] ) is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibuc치, Honduras. The city of La Esperanza is merged indistinguishably with the city of Intibuc치, the head of the neighbouring municipality of Intibuc치. Intibuc치 is the older of the two cities and was originally a Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. The two cities, often called the twin cities, while distinct with separate municipal governments, are generally referred to jointly as La Esperanza and are separated only by a street that crosses town.
