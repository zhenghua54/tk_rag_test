Opéra comique (] ; plural: "opéras comiques") is a genre of French opera that contains spoken dialogue and arias. It emerged from the popular "opéra comiques en vaudevilles" of the Fair Theatres of St Germain and St Laurent (and to a lesser extent the Comédie-Italienne), which combined existing popular tunes with spoken sections. Associated with the Paris theatre of the same name, "opéra comique" is not always comic or light in nature; "Carmen", perhaps the most famous "opéra comique", is a tragedy.
