Ungod is the debut album released in 1994 on Columbia Records by the American industrial rock band Stabbing Westward. The album was recorded in six weeks of 1993 in Chiswick, England, and released on February 15, 1994. With adequate album sales and touring with the likes of Depeche Mode a second album was warranted, "Wither Blister Burn & Peel". The guitar line in the chorus of the song "Ungod" was later used in Filter's song "Hey Man, Nice Shot." Stuart Zechman, who was also playing guitar for Filter at the time, took the riff and showed it to Stabbing Westward who ended up using it as well. The song "Nothing" appeared in the "Bad Boys" movie starring Will Smith, Martin Lawrence and TÃ©a Leoni, but was not featured on the official soundtrack album. The song also accompanied the credits of the film "Johnny Mnemonic" and was included on the film's soundtrack, along with the song "Lost". "Lost", "Lies" and "Can't Happen Here" were used in the film "Mortal Kombat", but Stabbing Westward refused to include it in the official soundtrack. The "Thread Mix" of "Violent Mood Swings" was included in the Clerks soundtrack.
