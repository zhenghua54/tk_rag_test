Johnny Cage is a fictional character from the "Mortal Kombat" fighting game franchise. He debuted as one of the series' original seven characters in the first "Mortal Kombat", and has since become a staple of the series. Created as a parody of martial arts actor and famous karate practitioner Jean-Claude Van Damme, Cage is a cocky and overconfident martial arts film actor who provides the comic relief of the franchise. He became a more layered character in "Mortal Kombat X", which introduced his and Sonya Blade's daughter Cassie Cage.
