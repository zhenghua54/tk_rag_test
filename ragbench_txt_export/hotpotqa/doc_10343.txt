The 2nd Battalion (Norwegian: "2. bataljon" ; abbreviated as 2BN) is an infantry unit of the Norwegian Army, based at camp Skjold in Troms county in Northern Norway. It serves in the light infantry role specialized in Arctic warfare as part of Brigade Nord; the battalion is one of three manoeuvre battalions within the brigade, along with Telemark Battalion and Panserbataljonen. The 2nd Battalion serves two roles, primarily being organised for domestic defence; however, during Norway's contribution to the NATO forces in Afghanistan, the 2nd Battalion played a vital role. The 2nd Battalion also contributed consistently to the ISAF forces in northern Afghanistan, supporting an elite trained light infantry, organized as a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). The battalion is divided into four companies: Bravo company, Charlie company, the cavalry squadron and the support company. Bravo company and Charlie coy serves as specialized light infantry, focusing on Arctic warfare and urban warfare. The cavalry squadron is the battalion's internal intelligence unit as well as consisting of one platoon of marksmen. The support company is the largest of the four, and primarily consists of medics, anti-tank personnel, combat, service and support. The battalion uses a khaki beret, as opposed to the traditional black beret worn by cavalry units throughout the world, which symbolizes the battalion's long and proud history of producing some of Norway's most elite and well equipped soldiers.
