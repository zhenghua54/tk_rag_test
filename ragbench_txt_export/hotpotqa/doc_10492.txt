Los Kumbia All Starz are a Mexican-American cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla.

Their 2006 debut album "Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz" reached number one on United States Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart, number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, and number sixty-eight on the United States "Billboard" 200. The album spawned two charting singles, "Chiquilla" (which reached number seven on Hot Latin Tracks, number nine on Latin Regional Mexican Airplay, number twenty-six on Latin Pop Airplay and number thirty-one on Latin Tropical Airplay) and "Parece Que Va a Llover" (which reached number thirty-three on Latin Regional Mexican Airplay).
