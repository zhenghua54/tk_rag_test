Hazeldean Mall is a shopping centre located in the Kanata district of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the intersection of Eagleson Road and Hazeldean Road, where Hazeldean Road turns into Robertson Road. It was the first enclosed shopping centre constructed in Kanata. The development of the mall was approved shortly before the incorporation of the (then) City of Kanata, and its approval lead to a legal battle between the constituent parts of the new municipality over the appropriate location of what would at that time be the new city's main commercial hub.
