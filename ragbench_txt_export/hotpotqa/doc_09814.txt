Arthur Eugene "Art" Arfons (February 3, 1926 – December 3, 2007) was the world land speed record holder three times from 1964 to 1965 with his "Green Monster" series of jet-powered cars, after a series of "Green Monster" piston-engine and jet-engined dragsters. He subsequently went on to field a succession of "Green Monster" turbine-engined pulling tractors, before returning to land speed record racing. He was announced as a 2008 inductee in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame three days after his death.
