Chowder is an American animated television series created by C. H. Greenblatt for Cartoon Network. The series follows an aspiring young child named Chowder and his day-to-day adventures as an apprentice in Chef Mung Daal's catering company. Although he means well, Chowder often finds himself in predicaments due to his perpetual appetite and his nature as a scatterbrain. It is animated with both traditional animation as well as short stop motion and puppet sequences that are inter-cut into the episodes, and that run over the end credits. Stop motion sequences are produced by Screen Novelties. It is also the first Cartoon Network original series to premiere during Stuart Snyder's tenure as Jim Samples had resigned months before the series premiere.
