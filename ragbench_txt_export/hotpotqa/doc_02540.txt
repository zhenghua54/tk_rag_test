Abbalagere was previously a Tobacco growing village, but now farmers are growing more Aracanut and plantation crops. Paddy, maize, vegetables are major crops. Most of farmers in the village are medium land holders. The village is close to Shimoga city, so many employees commute daily between the city and the village for work.
