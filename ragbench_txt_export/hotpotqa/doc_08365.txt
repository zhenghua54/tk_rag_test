A race engineer is a motorsport team member whose role is to communicate with the data analyst as well as the mechanics to determine the changes to be made to the vehicle. Off the race track, the race engineer analyzes historical data to determine the initial set up for the next race event. The race engineer function includes hands-on management of the vehicle mechanics, organizing testing schedule, as well as studying the regulations. The race engineer seeks to make all these activities occur as seamlessly as possible for their driver.
