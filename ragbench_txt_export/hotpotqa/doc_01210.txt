Multiple Maniacs is a 1970 American black comedy film composed, shot, edited, written, produced, and directed by American cult filmmaker John Waters, and was his second feature film. The film features several actors who were part of the Dreamland acting troupe for Waters' films, including Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, David Lochary, Mink Stole, Edith Massey, George Figgs, and Cookie Mueller. The title pays tribute to Herschell Gordon Lewis's "2000 Maniacs", as Waters states in his book "Shock Value".
