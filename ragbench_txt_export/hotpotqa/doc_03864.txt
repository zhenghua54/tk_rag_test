15 Penn Plaza, also known as the Vornado Tower, is a proposed 68-story tower in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City planned by Vornado Realty Trust. It would have 430 units and 2,050,000 square feet (190,451 mÂ²) of floor space. The Hiller Group is the designer. Despite only having 68 floors, it would be just 10 m shorter than the Empire State Building, which has 102 floors.
