Connecticut is divided among five congressional districts from which citizens elect the state's representatives to the United States House of Representatives. After the 2008 elections, all five of Connecticut's representatives are Democrats. Christopher Shays, previously the only Republican in the state's congressional delegation as well as the only Republican member of the House from New England, lost his re-election bid in 2008.
