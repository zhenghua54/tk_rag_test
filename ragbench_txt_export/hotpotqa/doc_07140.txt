Bones #05 (born March 31, 2003) is a retired world champion bucking bull owned by Tom Teague. In 2014, he received the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Brand of Honor, the highest honor bestowed upon a bull by the PBR . He bucked on the PBR tour for four years on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) elite circuit. The Brand of Honor designation is comparable to a hall of fame induction for the PBR. Bones was also awarded the World Champion Bull title in 2008 and 2010 at the PBR World Finals. Only one other bull, Dillinger, won the title two times. Two other bulls, Little Yellow Jacket and Bushwacker, won the award three times. In 2011, the year after Bones won the 2010 World Champion Bull title, when the bull was 7 years old, Teague announced his retirement from the sport. Bones lives on Teague's ranch in his retirement.
