Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003. At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format. This box set, and the companion release "Rancho Texicano", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from "ZZ Top's First Album", "Rio Grande Mud", and "Tejas", aside from 1977's "The Best of ZZ Top" which features two tracks from "Rio Grande Mud" and one track from "First Album". "Tres Hombres" and "Fandango!" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes.
