Nirula's is India's oldest fast food restaurant chain. Based in North India and most popular in NCR Delhi, it was Delhi's first fast food restaurant, opening in Connaught Place in 1977. Today it has over 70 outlets in NCR Delhi, Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh states, offering a “Desi” version of Western fast food items. Nirula's success has led them to branch out into other ventures which include, ‘Potpourri’, an Indian cuisine, casual dining restaurant chain; ‘Nirula's 21’, ice cream parlour chain, in addition to pastry shops and two hotels in Noida and Panipat. Recently Nirula's opened its first franchise in Patna, their first outlet in the entire east zone.
