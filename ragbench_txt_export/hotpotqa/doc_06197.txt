The Super Show was the first Asia-wide live concert tour by South Korean boy band, Super Junior. The tour commenced five months after the release of the group's second studio album, "Don't Don". The concert covers most songs from the group's first two studio albums, including their hit single, "U," and also subgroup hits from Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior-T, and Super Junior-M. The tour kicked off with three stops in South Korea and expanded its routes to Thailand and China.
