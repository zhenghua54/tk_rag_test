Brian O'Nolan (Irish: "Brian Ó Nualláin" ; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966) was an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist, considered a major figure in twentieth century Irish literature. Born in Strabane, County Tyrone, he is regarded as a key figure in postmodern literature. His English language novels, such as "At Swim-Two-Birds", and "The Third Policeman", were written under the "pen name" Flann O'Brien. His many satirical columns in "The Irish Times" and an Irish language novel "An Béal Bocht" were written under the name Myles na gCopaleen.
