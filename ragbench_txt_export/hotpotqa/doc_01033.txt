Caesalpinia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Historically, membership within the genus has been highly variable, with different publications including anywhere from 70 to 165 species, depending largely on the inclusion or exclusion of species alternately listed under genera such as "Hoffmannseggia". It contains tropical or subtropical woody plants. The generic name honors the botanist, physician, and philosopher Andrea Cesalpino (1519â€“1603).
