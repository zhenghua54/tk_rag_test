Andrew G. Kaufman (January 17, 1949 â€“ May 16, 1984) was an American comedian, actor, writer, performance artist and professional wrestler. While often referred to as a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a "song and dance man." He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in a rare introspective interview, "I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. ... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can."
