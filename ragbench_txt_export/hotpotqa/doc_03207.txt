The Johnny Cash Family Christmas is the 41st overall and second Christmas album by country singer Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in 1972). It is his second Christmas album, the first one being the 1963 release entitled "The Christmas Spirit". The album includes less original Cash material than its predecessor and contains narrations and dialogue featuring his family and friends, between tracks. In all, three songs were written or co-written by Cash, while two, "Christmas as I Knew It" and "Silent Night", had been featured on "The Christmas Spirit" ("Silent Night" would, in fact, be featured on all four Johnny Cash Christmas albums). June Carter Cash, Marshall Grant, Tommy Cash, Harold Reid, Larry Butler (who was both Cash's piano player and record producer at this time), Maybelle Carter, Anita Carter, Carl Perkins and Lew DeWitt are among those featured on the album.
