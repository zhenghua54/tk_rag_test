The 2004–05 NBA season was the Grizzlies' tenth season in the National Basketball Association, and their fourth season in Memphis. Coming off their first playoff appearance in franchise history, the Grizzlies had a new look and moved into their new arena, the FedExForum. However, the team struggled with a 5–7 start as 71-year old Hubie Brown retired from coaching due to "unexpected health problems". The Grizzlies would lose their next four games under Lionel Hollins before replacing him with TNT analyst Mike Fratello. Under Fratello, the Grizzlies would win 12 of their 15 games in January climbing back into playoff connection. Despite losing five of their last six games, the Grizzlies finished fourth in the Southwest Division with a 45–37 record, making their second consecutive trip to the playoffs.
