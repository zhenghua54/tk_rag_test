The season produced twenty-three tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical storms and sixteen further intensified to become hurricanes, which broke the record holding the most number of hurricanes within the basin tied with the 1990 and 1992 seasons. The first named storm of the season, Amanda, developed on May 22 before intensifying into a hurricane on May 24. At 0300 UTC on May 25, it intensified into Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the second-earliest major hurricane on record, behind 2012's Hurricane Bud. At 1500 UTC, Amanda reached its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), becoming the strongest May hurricane on record in the eastern Pacific. In mid-June, Hurricane Cristina intensified to become the earliest second major hurricane on the record in the East Pacific, beating the previous record set by Hurricane Darby in 2010. On August 24, Hurricane Marie became the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Celia in 2010, and it was the sixth most intense Pacific hurricane on record in terms of minimum atmospheric pressure.
