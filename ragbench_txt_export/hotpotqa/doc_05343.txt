"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet", in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her rival's house of Montague, that is, that he is named "Montague." The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language, seen underlined below. This scene is called the balcony scene by many people. Juliet not only makes the statement above but compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he wasn't named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's Love. Also as said before this states that if he wasn't Romeo, then he wouldn't be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.
