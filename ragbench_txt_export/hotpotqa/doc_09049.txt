Fruit Chan Gor (; born 15 April 1959) is an independent Hong Kong Second Wave screenwriter, filmmaker and producer, who is best known for his style of film reflecting the everyday life of Hong Kong people. He is well known for using amateur actors (such as Sam Lee in "Made in Hong Kong", Wong Yau-Nam in "Hollywood Hong Kong") in his films. His name became familiar to many Hong Kongers only after the success of the 1997 film "Made in Hong Kong", which earned many local and international awards. Chan was deeply influenced by the era of sixties film in Japan, for the reason that they were not afraid to produce realistic movies that addressed society's problems. In particular, Nagisa Oshima, a Japanese director during the sixties was someone who Chan looked up to and thought of when directing Made in Hong Kong.
