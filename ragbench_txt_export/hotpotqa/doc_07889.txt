The FIFA Women's World Cup is an international football competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of "Fédération Internationale de Football Association" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The competition has been held every four years since 1991, when the inaugural tournament, then called the Women's World Championship, was held in China.
