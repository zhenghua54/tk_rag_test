Roberta Kalechofsky (born May 11, 1931) is an American writer, feminist and animal rights activist, focusing on the issue of animal rights within Judaism and the promotion of vegetarianism within the Jewish community. She is the founder of Jews for Animal Rights and runs Micah Publications or Micah Books, which specializes in the publication of animal-rights, Jewish vegetarian, and Holocaust literature. She is married to Dr. Robert Kalechofsky, a retired mathematics professor from Salem State University, author of several books on theoretical mathematics, and a long-time long-distance runner, despite three knee replacements. They appear together representing Micah Books at publisher, writer, vegetarian, and animal rights events around North America, including the Boston Vegetarian Society's annual Boston Vegetarian Food Festival. She is a popular speaker in vegetarian groups, though she is not considered 'standard fare' for such groups.
