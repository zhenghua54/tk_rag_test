Mystechs (sometimes referred to as The Mystechs) is an electronic/punk music group formed in 1998 in Chicago, Illinois. The band's lineup consists of keyboardist/songwriter Emil Hyde joined by a host of other musicians and collaborators. Their music covers a wide range of genres from indie rock to new wave, hip hop and heavy metal. The Mystechs began as an electronica group, gradually incorporating other genres to their sound. Hyde says of the band, "Mystechs began as a nice, normal, female-fronted trip-hop group like Portishead or Esthero".
