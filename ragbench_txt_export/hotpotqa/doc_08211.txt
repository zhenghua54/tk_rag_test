Namak Haram Deorhi (also known as the "Traitor's Gate", "Jafarganj Deorhi" or "Jufarganj Palace") was the palace of Mir Jafar. It is located just opposite to the Jafarganj Cemetery in the "Lalbagh" area of the town of Murshidabad and near Mahimapur in the Indian state of West Bengal. Namak Haram Deorhi refers to both the place of Mir Jafar and the main gate which leads to the palace. This building was used as the residence of Mir Jafar, before he ascended the "musnad" of Bengal or when he was the Commander-in-Chief of the "subha".
