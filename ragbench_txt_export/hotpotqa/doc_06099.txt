The 1952-53 NBA season was the Bullets' 6th season in the NBA. The team featured Hall of Fame center Don Barksdale. With a .229 winning percentage, the team was selected by Nate Silver as the worst team to have ever advanced to the post-season in the NBA, NFL, NHL, or MLB. The Bullets never again made the playoffs, and the franchise folded midway through the 1954-55 season.
