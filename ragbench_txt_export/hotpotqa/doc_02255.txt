The 2000–01 NBA season was the Hawks' 52nd season in the National Basketball Association, and 33rd season in Atlanta. Under new head coach Lon Kruger, the Hawks got off to a bad start losing their first seven games, but then posted a 7–7 record in December. In January, they traded Jim Jackson to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Brevin Knight. After playing in the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, Dikembe Mutombo was traded at midseason along with Roshown McLeod to the Philadelphia 76ers for Theo Ratliff, Toni Kukoč and Nazr Mohammed. However, Ratliff injured his shooting hand prior to the trade, and was out for the remainder of the season. Mutombo would later on be named Defensive Player of the Year with the Sixers, who went on to lose in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.
