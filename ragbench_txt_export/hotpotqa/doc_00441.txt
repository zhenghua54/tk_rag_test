Liquorice Stick ( ) or alternatively spelled Licorice Stick, also known as a "Regaliz," is a highball (cocktail) made of cola, anisette or absinthe, and black licorice as a garnish. It originated in Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal where it was called a "pauzinho de alca√ßuz" as an alternative to the rum and cola drink called a "cuba libre". In Spain it is called a "palito de orozuz". It was introduced into the U.S. through the Portuguese communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
