Cottrell James "C. J." Hunter III (born December 14, 1968) is an American former shot putter and coach. He was the 1999 World Champion, but is perhaps best known for his involvement in the BALCO scandal and as the onetime spouse of sprinter Marion Jones. His personal best was 71' 9", (21,87 m) thrown during a 2nd-place finish in the 2000 US Olympic Trials. A month later he was tested positive for the performance-enhancing steroid Nandrolone at the Bislett Games, which was revealed before he had been scheduled to compete in the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. He had previously competed at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, finishing seventh.
