True is the debut studio album by Swedish DJ Avicii. It was released on 13 September 2013 on compact disc and audio cassette through PRMD Music, Lava Records and Sony Music Entertainment's Columbia Records. Avicii said that sonically, the album would move away from his electronic dance and house music sound on previous records, by incorporating elements of other genres such as country music. "True" was preceded by the release of the Aloe Blacc-assisted and Aileen Marie Quinn-written "Wake Me Up!" that featured a rare Marantz Enhanced Digital Stereo audio track and topped several charts around the world, and "You Make Me", which features vocals from Swedish artist Salem Al Fakir.
