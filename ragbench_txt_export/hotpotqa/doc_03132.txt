"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)" is a song performed by American girl group The Pussycat Dolls for their second studio album "Doll Domination" (2008). It was released on February 23, 2009, by Interscope Records as the fourth single from the record. After watching "Slumdog Millionaire" record executives Jimmy Iovine and Ron Fair wanted to turn "Jai Ho" into a "pop record without deviating from the original melody" and asked Scherzinger to do her own interpretation of the song. The song was credited as ""A. R. Rahman and The Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger"".
