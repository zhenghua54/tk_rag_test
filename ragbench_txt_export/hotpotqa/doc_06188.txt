Government Center is a district in Downtown Miami, Florida. Bounded roughly by I-95 and NW 3rd Avenue to the west, SW 1st Street to the south, NW 5th Street to the north, and NE 1st Avenue to the east, Government Center is located on the western edge of downtown. The area includes several courthouses, including the historic Miami-Dade County Courthouse and a US district court, the City of Miami police headquarters, city, county, and state offices. The eponymous and most used county transit station, Government Center, serving Metrorail, Metromover, and Metrobus, is located in the bottom of the Stephen P. Clark Government Center building. Directly south of this is the main branch of the Miami-Dade Public Library System, as well as the HistoryMiami museum. Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad owns roughly nine acres in the middle of Government Center, the site of its former Miami station, which spans several blocks. While the station was destroyed in 1963 and the site had been used as surface parking lots in the decades following, the railroad never gave up ownership of the property. In mid 2014, the lots were closed down for construction of a new Downtown Miami intercity rail station, as part of their All Aboard Florida system.
