The Italian Peninsula or Apennine Peninsula (Italian: "Penisola italiana" , "Penisola appenninica") extends 1000 km from the Po Valley in the north to the central Mediterranean Sea in the south. The peninsula's shape gives it the nickname "lo Stivale" (the Boot). Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (the "toe"), Salento (the "heel") and Gargano (the "spur").
