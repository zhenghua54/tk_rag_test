Girl was a weekly comic magazine for girls published from 1951 to 1964. It was launched by Hulton Press on 2 November 1951 as a sister paper to the "Eagle", and lasted through Hultons' acquisition by Odhams Press in 1959 and Odhams' merger into IPC in 1963. Its final issue was dated 3 October 1964, after which it was merged into "Princess". Another comic of the same name was published by IPC from 1981 to 1990, during which time "Dreamer" and "Tammy" were merged into it.Girl was very much an "educational" magazine whose heroines, including those who got into scrapes, became involved in tales which had a moral substance. A considerable number of pages were also dedicated to real life tales of heroic women in various fields.
