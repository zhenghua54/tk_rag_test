Mimosa is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs, in the mimosoid clade of the legume family Fabaceae. The generic name is derived from the Greek word μιμος ("mimos"), an "actor" or "mime," and the feminine suffix –"osa", "resembling", suggesting its 'sensitive leaves' which seem to 'mimic conscious life'.
