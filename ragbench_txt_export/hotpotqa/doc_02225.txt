A Reverse Willie Horton is either the debut album, or an early bootleg album, by the New York City-based Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Few (500) copies of the album were produced; however, some songs are featured on the group's next two albums, 1992's The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and 1993's Crypt Style, albeit in a different mix or recording altogether. However, sound of the recording is closer to the Crypt Style LP. All three albums are made up of tracks recorded in 1991 by producer/engineer Kramer and Steve Albini (in separate sessions).
