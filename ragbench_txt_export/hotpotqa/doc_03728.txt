Malcolm is a character in William Shakespeare's "Macbeth" (c. 1603â€“1607). The character is based on the historical king Malcolm III of Scotland, and is derived largely from the account in "Holinshed's Chronicles" (1587), a history of Britain. He is the elder son of King Duncan, the heir to the throne, and brother to Donalbain. In the end, he regains the throne after mustering support to overthrow Macbeth.
