Alcator C-Mod was a tokamak, a magnetically confined nuclear fusion device, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). In 2016 it achieved the highest yet magnetic field strength and highest plasma pressure, which is notable because it does not use superconducting magnets. It was one of the major fusion research facilities in the United States.
