The Zen Center of Syracuse (or, Syracuse Zen Center), temple name Hoen-ji, is a Rinzai Zen Buddhist practice center in Syracuse, New York, one of the oldest continuously running Zen centers in the United States. Founded in 1972, the center is currently led by Roko Sherry Chayat . Originally located at 111 Concord Place, the center is located in both the former carriage house and home of Joshua Forman (the first mayor of Syracuse) and offers Zen practice for laypeople. It began as a group of graduate students from Syracuse University, with Chayat eventually becoming the center's leader. In addition to Zen practice, the center also provides some instruction in Tibetan Buddhism. According to "The Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America", "The Syracuse Zen Center also leads meditation at Syracuse University, Syracuse area schools, recovery and justice system institutions, hospitals and corporations." The center also won two awards for their restoration of The Forman House from the Preservation Association of Central New York . This house was instrumental during the War of 1812 and the American Civil War, for it was a bandage assembly area for wounded troops.
