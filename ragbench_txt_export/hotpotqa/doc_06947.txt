Holland Park is a park in the city of Surrey, British Columbia, located within the town centre of Whalley beside the Central City Shopping Centre. It is 10 hectare (25 acres) in size and although it is not the largest park in the city, it has been called the "Central Park" of Surrey city centre. Originally a piece of land that was unused and not landscaped, the city of Surrey designated the area as an urban park and was transformed in the mid 2000s.
