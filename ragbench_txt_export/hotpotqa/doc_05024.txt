Under an Hour is the second full-length album from Portland-based experimental pop/rock group Menomena. The album was originally composed and performed as accompaniment for a performance by Portland dance company Monster Squad. Consisting of three instrumental tracks, the album is considered to be an experimental soundtrack along the lines of Peter Gabriel's or Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack for "About a Boy".
