Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC is the holding company of Jaguar Land Rover Limited, a British multinational automotive company with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, United Kingdom, and a subsidiary of Indian automaker Tata Motors. The principal activity of Jaguar Land Rover Limited is the design, development, manufacture and sale of vehicles bearing the Jaguar and Land Rover (including Range Rover) marques. Both marques have long and complex histories prior to their merger, going back to the 1940s, first coming together in 1968 as part of the ill-fated British Leyland conglomerate; and later existed independently of each other as subsidiaries of BMW (in the case of Land Rover), and Ford Motor Company (in the case of Jaguar); Ford later acquired Land Rover from BMW in 2000 following the break-up of the former Rover Group; which was effectively the remainder of British Leyland.
