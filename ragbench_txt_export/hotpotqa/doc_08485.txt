The 2002–03 NBA season was the 14th season for the Orlando Magic in the National Basketball Association. During the offseason, the Magic signed free agent All-Star forward Shawn Kemp. The rise of Tracy McGrady into a superstar was completed as he won his first scoring title with 32.1 points per game, while being selected for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. However, with Grant Hill playing just 29 games due to injury, and Horace Grant only playing just five games with a sore left knee, it seemed as if he was all alone again. Midway through the season, the Magic traded Mike Miller to the Memphis Grizzlies for rookie Drew Gooden as they finished fourth in the Atlantic Division with a record of 42–40. However, in the first round of the playoffs, they lost to the top-seeded Detroit Pistons four games to three after taking a 3–1 series lead. Following the season, Kemp retired, Darrell Armstrong signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Hornets, and Grant re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.
