Libertad y Desarrollo, abbreviated to LyD, is a Chilean think tank focused on liberal, free market economic studies. Founded in 1990, the think tank defines itself as a "center for studies and private research, independent of any political, religious, business, or governmental organization, that is dedicated to the analysis of public affairs promoting the values and principles of a free society". The think tank is the Chilean representative of RELIAL, the Liberal Network of Latin America ("Red Liberal de America Latina"). The center is divided into 7 programs: Economic Program, Social Program, Society and Politics Program, Legislative Program, Environmental Program, and the Justice Program. The group's goal is to respond to these various issues with a liberal, free market perspective and to make public policy recommendations specific to Chile for legislators, but not to participate in government directly. Economists Hernan Büchi, Luis Larraín, Cristián Larroulet are affiliated with the think tank.
