Leviathan was a New Left radical underground newspaper published in a tabloid newspaper format and distributed through the underground press network in the US in the years 1969-1970. Fairly serious in content with a focus on radical organizing issues, it was loosely aligned with the SDS movement. The first issue was dated March, 1969, with two editorial offices in New York, where Carol Brightman, Beverly Leman, and Kathy McAfee were listed on the first masthead, later to be joined by a number of others including Marge Piercy and Sol Yurick; and San Francisco, where the collective included Peter Booth Wiley, Carole Deutch, Danny Beagle, Bob Gavriner, Al Haber, Bruce Nelson, and David Wellman. Part of the inspiration for the paper was a desire to fill the gap created by the demise of the influential New Left organ "Studies on the Left", and the core group included people from the antiwar newsletter "Viet Report".
