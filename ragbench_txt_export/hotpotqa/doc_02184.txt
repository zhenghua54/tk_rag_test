The Rake's Progress is an opera in three acts and an epilogue by Igor Stravinsky. The libretto, written by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings "A Rake's Progress" (1733â€“1735) of William Hogarth, which Stravinsky had seen on 2 May 1947, in a Chicago exhibition.
