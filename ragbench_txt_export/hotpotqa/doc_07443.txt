The Data Recall Diamond One was a word processing typewriter, designed and built by Data Recall Ltd at Dorking, Surrey, England in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The machine drove a Qume daisy wheel printer via a serial interface at 35â€“55 characters per second, and used an 8-inch floppy disc drive capable of holding 250,000 characters. It was user programmable. Later models included the Diamond III, the Diamond Five (a.k.a. Diamond V), and the Diamond 7.
