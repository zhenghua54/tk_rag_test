Aneroid Lake is a large tarn located on Aneroid Mountain in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of northeastern Oregon. It is situated in between Roger Lake and Dollar Lake. It is not accessible by any kind of motor vehicle. However, there is a popular hiking trail that leads to the lake. There is a small group of private cabins near the south end and Pete's Point is clearly visible from the lake.
