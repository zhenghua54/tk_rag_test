Michael Wynne is an English playwright born in Birkenhead on 3 August 1972. While reading for a Politics degree in London, he entered a competition for new young writers run by the Royal Court Theatre. He won this with his first play "The Knocky" - an award-winning comedy, set on a Birkenhead council estate. It was produced at the Royal Court in 1995 and subsequently performed at Liverpool's Everyman Theatre in 1997. In 2010, Wynne won the Olivier Award for Best New Comedy for "The Priory". In 2011, Wynne wrote the BBC Christmas show, "Lapland". A series was later announced, entitled "Being Eileen", again written by Wynne, which began to air on 4 February 2013.
