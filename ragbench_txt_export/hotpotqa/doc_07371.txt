The NWA World Welterweight Championship (Spanish: "Campeonato Mundial Welter de NWA" ) is a professional wrestling championship governed by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and currently promoted by NWA Mexico. The championship was originally created by the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in 1946. The promotion had control of the championship from 1946 until 1996 and again from 2007 until 2010. From 1996 until 2007 the championship was promoted mainly in Japan, first as one of eight championships that made up the New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) J-Crown Championship. After the J-Crown was discontinued the title remained in Japan being promoted by the Toryumon promotion up until 2007 when it returned to Mexico and CMLL. CMLL was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance up until the late 1980s but chose to keep the championship and the NWA prefix after leaving the NWA. As it is a professional wrestling championship, its holders are determined by promoters or promotions, not by athletic competition. The official definition of the welterweight weight limit in Mexico is 70 kg to 78 kg , but promotions have ignored the weight limit at times and crowned champions both heavier and lighter than the rules defined.
