The Butte de Warlencourt is an ancient burial mound off the Albert–Bapaume road, north-east of Le Sars in the Somme "département" of northern France. It is located on the territory of the commune of Warlencourt-Eaucourt and slightly north of a minor road to Gueudecourt and Eaucourt l'Abbaye. During the First World War, the Germans constructed deep dugouts throughout the butte and surrounded it by several belts of barbed wire, making it a formidable defensive position in advance of "Gallwitz Riegel" (the Gird Trenches). After the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September 1916), the view from the butte dominated the new British front line and was used by the Germans for artillery observation.
