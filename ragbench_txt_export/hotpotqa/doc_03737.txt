The Oracle was the fictional High School newspaper in the "Sweet Valley High" book series. It was well-run and mostly very informative. Elizabeth Wakefield was the most dedicated staff member and most of her friends worked with her. The editor-in-chief was Penny Ayala, who saw this as a step to being an editor of an international newspaper, and it was because of that reason that she and Elizabeth were close friends. Other staff members included Arts editor Olivia Davidson; John Pfeifer, who was sports editor until he pursued a vicious vendetta against Lila Fowler; Abbie Richardson who was the staff cartoonist (she created and drew the comic strip, "Jenny"); and Jeffrey French who was one of several photographers along with Penny's younger sister, Tina Ayala and Allen Walters.
