As an actress, Brandy has appeared in feature films and television shows. She made her television debut in 1993 in the ABC sitcom "Thea", as the daughter of a single mother (Thea Vidale). Broadcast to low ratings, the series ran for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. In 1996, her short-lived engagement on "Thea" led Brandy to star in her own show, the UPN-produced sitcom "Moesha", in which she played the title role of Moesha Mitchell, a Los Angeles girl coping with a stepmother as well as the pressures and demands of becoming an adult. The program debuted on UPN in January 1996, and soon became their most-watched show. The network decided to cancel the show after six seasons on the air, leaving it ending with a cliffhanger for a scrapped seventh season. Brandy was awarded an NAACP Image Award for her performance. In 1997, Brandy was hand-picked by producer Whitney Houston to play the title character in Rodgers and Hammersteinâ€™s television version of "Cinderella" featuring a multicultural cast that also included Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, and Houston. The two-hour "Wonderful World of Disney" special garnered an estimated 60 million viewers, giving the network its highest ratings in the time period in 16 years, and won an Emmy Award the following year.
