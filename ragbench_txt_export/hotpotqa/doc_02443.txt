Poutine ( ; ) is a Quebecois–Canadian dish originally made with French fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. The dish emerged in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec area. For most of its existence, poutine was negatively perceived and mocked, which is in drastic contrast with its later popularity. In the past, poutine was even used as a means of stigmatization against the Quebec society. Today, poutine is celebrated both within and outside Quebec borders. Poutine festivals are held in Drummondville, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto and Ottawa, as well as in other places, including some outside of Canada: Chicago and New Hampshire. Poutine is now served using different toppings and ingredients beyond the original French fries, cheese curds, and brown gravy. Nicolas Fabien-Ouellet, the author of "Poutine Dynamics" (a peer-reviewed article published in CuiZine), suggests that with its increasing variations, poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, just like sandwiches, dumplings, soups, flatbreads.
