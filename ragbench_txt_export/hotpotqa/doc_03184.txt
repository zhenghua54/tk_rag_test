The Kamp Store is a historic general store building located at the northeast corner of Oak and Broadway in Kampsville, Illinois, United States. Joseph Kamp, the son of the founder of Kampsville, opened the store in 1902. The two-story wood frame building features a false front with decorative metalwork. The store provided Kampsville residents with a wide variety of goods, ranging from small household items to automobiles and heavy farming equipment. St. Louis-based suppliers shipped the store its goods via Mississippi River barges. Kamp operated the store until his death in 1952; the store served as a grocery store until the 1970s and later became a carpet store. The Center for American Archeology purchased the building in 1991 and now uses it as its Visitor's Center and Museum.
