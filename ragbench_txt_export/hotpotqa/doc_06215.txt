The Nissan Armada is Nissan's full-size SUV. It shares its body-on-frame "F-Alpha" platform with the Nissan Titan pickup truck, Nissan Xterra SUV, Nissan Frontier pickup truck, and Nissan Pathfinder SUV. An upscale version of the Armada was sold as the Infiniti QX56 from 2004 to 2010, when it switched to a platform based on the Nissan Patrol. From 2003 to 2015 the Armada was assembled in Canton, Mississippi. From mid-2016 onwards, the Armada is currently built in Yukuhashi, Kyushu, Japan and share the same platform as the Patrol, with American-specific modifications, and went on sale in late Summer 2016 as a 2017 model.
