Puma is a genus in Felidae that contains the cougar (also known as the puma, among other names) and the jaguarundi, and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives (for example, "Puma pardoides", or "Owen's panther," a large cougar-like cat of Eurasia's Pliocene). In addition to these potential Old World fossil there are a couple of New World fossil representatives such as "Puma pumoides" and possibly the two species of the so-called "American cheetah".
