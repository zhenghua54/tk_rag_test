Qualifying for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup to be held in Spain began in earnest on the 2011 Caribbean Championships, a qualifier to the 2012 Centrobasket, which is in itself a qualifier to the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship. The winners of the 2012 Olympic basketball tournament, the United States, qualified outright. The USA joined the host nation Spain, which was earlier elected to host the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in July 2009.
