Bognera is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. The single species that makes up the genus is Bognera recondita. The word "recondita" means "hidden" referring to the fact that the plant is only found in remote areas of Amazonian Brazil near the Peruvian border. The species was discovered in the late 1970s and was originally placed in the genus "Ulearum". In 1984 a new genus, "Bognera" named after the German Aroid specialist Josef Bogner, was created for it. "Bognera" is believed to be closely related to "Dieffenbachia".
