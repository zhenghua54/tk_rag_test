Traugott Martin von Sauberzweig (October 28, 1863 to April 14, 1920 in Kassel) was a Prussian "Generalleutnant" (Lieutenant General) who served on both the Eastern and Western Front in the German Army during World War I. In 1915 he had been Military Governor of Brussels in the days of Edith Cavell's execution, and in connection with this tragedy his name was prominently mentioned. The Cavell case was the reason that von Sauberzweig was supplanted. Among those who had to suffer under his following anger had been Herbert Hoover and his Commission for Relief in Belgium as von Sauberzweig was close to interrupt the services of this organisation. He served as chief of staff on the 8th Army in the Ukraine in 1916 and was awarded the "Pour le MÃ©rite" on 6 September 1917.
