Anne of Ingleside is a children's novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery. It was first published in July 1939 by McClelland and Stewart (Toronto) and the Frederick A. Stokes Company (New York). It is the tenth of eleven books that feature the character of Anne Shirley, and Montgomery's final published novel. (Two novels that occur later in the "Anne" chronology were actually published years earlier. As well, the short story collection "The Blythes Are Quoted", written in 1941/42, but not published until 2009, concludes the Anne chronology.)
