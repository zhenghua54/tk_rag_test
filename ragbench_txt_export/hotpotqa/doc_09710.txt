"All 4 Love" (also known as "All for Love") is a number-one single by the music group Color Me Badd released in 1991 as the third single from their debut album "C.M.B." As a number-one single, it replaced Michael Jackson's "Black or White" and was then replaced by Elton John and George Michael's "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" in early 1992. It was the band's second number-one single in the US, and also their last one. The recording contains elements and/or samples of the 1966 minor R&B hit "Patch My Heart" by The Mad Lads. In 2002, Stevie Brock covered it as his first single.
