Mark Robert Bowden (born July 17, 1951) is an American writer and author. He is a National Correspondent for The Atlantic and a contributing editor at "Vanity Fair". Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he is a 1973 graduate of Loyola University Maryland. While at Loyola, he was inspired to embark on a journalistic career by reading Tom Wolfe's book "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test". In 2010, in his acceptance speech for a lifetime achievement award at the National Book Awards, Wolfe called Bowden one of the two "writers to watch" (along with Michael Lewis).
