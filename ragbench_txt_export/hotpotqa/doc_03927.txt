The 1989 Baltimore Orioles season was a season in American baseball. It involved the Orioles finishing 2nd in the American League East with a record of 87 wins and 75 losses. The team was known as the Comeback Kids as they rebounded from the 54 wins and 107 losses of the 1988 season. The season also took on the "Why Not?!" promotional slogan as the team's pursuit of the pennant went down to the final series of the season. The Orioles went into the 3 game season finale with the first place Toronto Blue Jays down by 1 game in the AL East standings and needing either a sweep for the pennant or 2 wins to force a one-game playoff for the pennant. The Blue Jays won the first two games of the series, clinching the pennant on the penultimate game of the season.
