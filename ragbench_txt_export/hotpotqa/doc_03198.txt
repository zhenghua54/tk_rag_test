The 1962 Minnesota Vikings season was the second year of season play for the Minnesota Vikings and the 43rd regular season of the National Football League. The Vikings finished with a record of two wins, 11 losses, and one tie under head coach Norm Van Brocklin. The 2-11-1 record still stands as the Vikings' worst season record by terms of winning percentage, both by today's standards (.179) and back then (.154), where ties weren't counted as games played. The Vikings have won at least three games in every season since.
