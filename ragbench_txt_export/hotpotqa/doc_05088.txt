Dirt track racing is a type of auto racing performed on clay or dirt surfaced oval tracks. It began in the United States before World War I and became widespread during the 1920s and 1930s. Two different types of race cars dominatedâ€”open wheel racers in the Northeast and West and stock cars in the South. While open wheel race cars are purpose-built racing vehicles, stock cars (also known as fendered cars) can be either purpose-built race cars or street vehicles that have been modified to varying degrees.
