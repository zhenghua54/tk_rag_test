Rock and Roll Over Tour is a concert tour by the American hard rock group Kiss. It began November 24, 1976 (shortly after the release of the Rock and Roll Over album) and ended April 4, 1977. It was on this tour where the band performed for the first time at Madison Square Garden on 2/18/77 - a venue all four members of the band had long dreamed of playing (February 18, 1977). The band also performed in Japan for the first time on this tour. They played Budokan Hall four nights in a row breaking the previous concert attendance record set by The Beatles. On December 12, 1976 Ace Frehley suffered a severe electrical shock on stage which delayed the concert. The delay lasted about fifteen minutes and then resumed; Ace was able to finish the show despite having lost feeling in one of his hands. Being inspired by the event, Ace wrote the song "Shock Me" which appeared on Kiss' next album release Love Gun (1977). It is the first Kiss song in which Ace sings lead vocals. This was the first tour on which "Beth" was performed live; instead of being played by the entire band, it was sung solo by drummer Peter Criss to a recording of the instrumental track from the Destroyer album.
