Ice Cream Man is a 1995 horror comedy film produced and directed by Norman Apstein, in his first and only attempt at mainstream filmmaking, written by Sven Davison and David Dobkin (who later wrote and directed the films "Wedding Crashers" and "Fred Claus"), and stars Clint Howard. The film made for an estimated $2 million budget, disappeared quickly after its release, but in recent years has developed a cult following among viewers who see it as an unintentional comedy, and enjoy it for its unintentionally campy production values. Joe Bob Briggs hosted the film on TNT, when it was shown on MonsterVision and Howard made an appearance, discussing the film with Briggs. It was released on DVD in 2004.
