English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding has recorded songs for three studio albums and guest features. After signing a contract with record label Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding began to work on her debut studio album, "Lights", which was ultimately released in February 2010. The first single released from the album was "Under the Sheets", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith. Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer. Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles "Starry Eyed" and "The Writer", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on "Your Biggest Mistake". In November 2010, the singer re-released "Lights" as "Bright Lights", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs. She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on "Lights" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's "Your Song". At this time, Goulding also contributed guest vocals on the song "Wonderman" for Tinie Tempah's debut studio album "Disc-Overy" (2010).
