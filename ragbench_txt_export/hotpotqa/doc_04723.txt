Wincenty Antonowicz (May 1, 1891 – 1984), along with his wife Jadwiga (1896–1942) and daughter Lucyna Antonowicz-Bauer (b. 1927), were the Polish family from Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania) who sheltered the 20-year-old Jewish woman Bronisława Malberg (b. 1917) in their house after the liquidation of the Wilno Ghetto during the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II, as well as two other Jewish families including Henia and Adi Kulgan. For their heroism, Wincenty and his wife Jadwiga were posthumously bestowed the titles of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem on June 14, 1998, followed by their daughter Lucyna, who herself received the same medal with diploma (dated August 19, 1998) on January 14, 1999 at the age of 72, during a ceremony in Warsaw.
