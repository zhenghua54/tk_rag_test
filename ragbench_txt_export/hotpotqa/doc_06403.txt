José Otavio , or Zé Otavio, is the given name of a Brazilian bodyboarder. He was born in the landlocked state of Minas Gerais. He started to surf in Guriri, Espírito Santo, and developed his skills as a bodyboarder on the beaches of Niterói, (in the state of Rio de Janeiro). Otavio has continued his career by surfing Brazil's most sought after bodyboarding waves at Itacoatiara beach. He was the first bodyboarder to execute a 720° reverse air spinner caught on tape, which can be seen in the bodyboarding video movie "QUE! Mutação".
