Utopia University, known in Chinese as Datong or Tatung University, was a private university in Shanghai. It was established in March 1912 by a group of former Tsinghua faculty members led by Hu Dunfu, and became one of the most reputable private universities in China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist government closed Utopia along with many other private universities in 1952. Its departments, faculty members, and students were divided and merged into various universities in Shanghai.
