"The Age of Not Believing" is a song written by Robert and Richard Sherman for the 1971 Walt Disney musical film production "Bedknobs and Broomsticks". Angela Lansbury sings the song in the motion picture. In the lyrics, Lansbury's character Eglantine expresses how as children grow up, they lose their belief in magic and doubt themselves. The song works on two levels, both on a personal, human level and thematically for the whole film- a Britain grown cynical from the pressures of war must learn to borrow from its own past magic in order to overcome the tremendous challenge which lies before it, while the characters in the film must finally learn to trust in Eglantine's magic to achieve their goals and save Britain from the Nazis.
