Apium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels. Some species are edible, notably "Apium graveolens", which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. "Apium bermejoi" from the island of Menorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.
