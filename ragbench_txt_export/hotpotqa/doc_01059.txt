Norwood, Ohio v. Horney 110 Ohio St.3d 353 was a case brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in 2006. The case came upon the heels of "Kelo v. City of New London", in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that commercial development justified the use of eminent domain. "Kelo" had involved the United States Constitution, while the issue in "Norwood" was the specific limitations of the Ohio State Constitution.
