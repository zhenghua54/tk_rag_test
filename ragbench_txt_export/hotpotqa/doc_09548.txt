Myron F. Diduryk (July 15, 1938 to April 24, 1970) was a Ukrainian-American United States Army Major, who played a key role as an infantry company commander in the Battle of Ia Drang, the first major battle of the Vietnam War. His exploits in that battle were described by Hal Moore in, "We Were Soldiers Once and Young". Moore said that Diduryk was, “… the finest battlefield company commander I had ever seen, bar none.” Diduryk was killed in action on his second tour in Vietnam.
