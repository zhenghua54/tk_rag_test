The SS Principessa Mafalda was an Italian transatlantic ocean liner built for the Navigazione Generale Italiana (NGI) company. Named after Princess Mafalda of Savoy, second daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III, the ship entered NGI's South American service between Genoa and Buenos Aires in 1909. At the time of her completion she was the largest Italian passenger ship afloat. The "Mafalda" was known for her luxury and was the preferred mode of travel for such celebrities of the day as Carlos Gardel.
