Prataprudra Deva (Odia: ପ୍ରତାପରୁଦ୍ର ଦେବ) was the last Gajapati emperor of Odisha from the Suryavamshi dynasty started by his grandfather Kapilendra Deva Routaraya. He ruled from the year 1497 to 1540 A.D. Besides being a ruler, he was a devout Vaishnava and adherent of the famous saint, Sri Chaitanaya who arrived in Odisha during is rule. His life was extremely occupied with overwhelming military campaigns in defense of his inherited territory from three frontal invasions by the enemy states Vijayanagar, Hussain Shahi dynasty of Bengal and Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golconda. He lost large portions of his territory to the neighboring enemy states initiating the dissolution of Odisha's military hegemony and imperial status that continued for nearly a period of 600 years before him.
