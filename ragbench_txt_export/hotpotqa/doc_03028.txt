The Jeep Wagoneer is the first luxury 4x4, sold and produced for Jeep through numerous marques from 1963 to 1991. A "sport utility vehicle" (SUV) for decades before the term was coined, the 4WD Wagoneer saw only minor mechanical changes during its 28-year plus production run, the third longest in U.S. automotive history.
