The New York Shipbuilding Corporation (or New York Ship for short) was an American shipbuilding company that operated from 1899 to 1968, ultimately completing more than 500 vessels for the U.S. Navy, the United States Merchant Marine, the United States Coast Guard, and other maritime concerns. At its peak during World War II, NYSB was the largest and most productive shipyard in the world. Its best-known vessels include the destroyer  , the cruiser  , the aircraft carrier  , the nuclear-powered cargo ship NS "Savannah", and a quartet of cargo-passenger liners nicknamed the "Four Aces".
