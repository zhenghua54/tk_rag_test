The statue is a focal point of Rawlins Park, a small public park in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It was installed in 1874, but relocated several times between 1880 and 1931. The statue was sculpted by French-American artist Joseph A. Bailly, whose best known work is the statue of George Washington in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.
