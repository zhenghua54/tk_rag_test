Barbara Anne Macdonald ("nee" Charles, September 11, 1913 â€“ June 15, 2000) was a social worker, lesbian feminist and ageism activist. Macdonald believed that ageism was a "central feminist issue" and made it the core of her activism. At the time, she was a "lone voice" fighting against and talking about ageism. Macdonald felt that ageism divided women and that the stigma of aging became a trap. In addition, Macdonald felt that defining women by their familial roles was the central contributor to ageism. She felt that older women tend to be seen as caretakers and mother-figures instead of as individuals. Macdonald used her anger to fuel her activism and through her anger, she identified many aspects of age-related issues that affect older women, such as poverty, physical challenges caused by age, violence against older women, and health issues: all of which she felt were not adequately addressed by younger feminists. Macdonald's activism inspired the formation of the group Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, which works in the United States to fight ageism.
