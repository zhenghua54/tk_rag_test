Bokor Hill Station (in Khmer: កស្ថានីយភ្នំបូកគោ "Kosthany Phnom Bokor") refers to a collection of French colonial buildings (hotel & casino, church, royal residence etc. ), constructed as a temperate mountain luxury resort and retreat for colonial residents in the early 1920s atop Bokor Mountain in Preah Monivong National Park, about 37 km west of Kampot in southern Cambodia. Abandoned for long periods of time, modern infrastructure has made the location easily accessible as re-development is taking place. It was used as the location for the final showdown of the movie "City of Ghosts" (2002) and the 2004 film "R-Point". To the north-east are the Povokvil Waterfalls.
