Sowar (Hindi: सवार, ਸਵਾਰ, also "siwar" meaning "the one who rides" or "rider", from Persian "sawār"), was originally a rank during the Mughal, Maratha period. Later during the British Raj it was the name in Anglo-Indian usage for a horse-soldier belonging to the cavalry troops of the native armies of British India and the feudal states. It is also used more specifically of a mounted orderly, escort or guard. It was also the rank held by ordinary cavalry troopers, equivalent to sepoy in the infantry - this rank has been inherited by the modern armies of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
