The 1996–97 NBA season was the Spurs' 21st season in the National Basketball Association, and 30th season as a franchise. During the offseason, the Spurs signed free agent and former All-Star Dominique Wilkins, who played in Greece last season, while re-signing free agent Vernon Maxwell. However, without All-Star center David Robinson, who played just six games due to back and foot injuries, and Chuck Person, who was out for the entire season with an offseason back injury, the Spurs struggled losing 13 of their first 15 games in November. After 18 games, head coach Bob Hill was fired and replaced with General Manager Gregg Popovich. Wilkins appeared in 63 games and led the team with 18.2 points per game. However, it would not be nearly enough as the Spurs finished sixth in the Midwest Division with an awful 20–62 record.
