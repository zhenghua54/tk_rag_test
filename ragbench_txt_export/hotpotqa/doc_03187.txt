Cliven D. Bundy (born April 29, 1946) is an American cattle rancher from Bunkerville, Nevada who is currently federally incarcerated and awaiting trial with bail denied for his role in the 2014 Bundy standoff. He vocally advocated a philosophy opposed to what he views as federal government overreach. He is known for having participated in the 2014 Bundy Standoff in Nevada, an armed standoff with federal and state law enforcement over defaulted grazing fees. Some viewed him as a hero for having led a movement of ranchers to encourage more ranchers to join him in defaulting on their grazing fees as per their federal grazing contracts. Some considered him to be dangerously provocative. He is the father of Ammon Bundy, who in 2016 also led another armed standoff against the government, the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.
