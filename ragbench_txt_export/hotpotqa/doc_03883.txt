Commedia all'italiana (i.e. "Comedy in the Italian way"; ] ) or Italian-style comedy is an Italian film genre. It is widely considered to have started with Mario Monicelli's "I soliti ignoti" ("Big Deal on Madonna Street") in 1958 and derives its name from the title of Pietro Germi's "Divorzio all'italiana" ("Divorce Italian Style", 1961).
