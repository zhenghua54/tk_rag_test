The 1985â€“86 New York Knicks season was the 40th season of NBA basketball in New York City, New York. The Knicks had won the first overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft in the league's first ever draft lottery, which they used to select Patrick Ewing out of Georgetown, who was regarded as the most sought-after prospect since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1969 by "The New York Times". He was signed to a six-year $17 million deal, the richest ever for an NBA rookie.
