The Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science was a museum of math that was open from 1980â€“2006 in Long Island, New York. The museum was named after mathematics teacher Bernhard Goudreau, who had died in 1985, and featured many of the 3-dimensional solid models, oversized wooden math games, and puzzles built by Goudreau and his former students. After the museum closed, Glen Whitney, a former math professor, decided to open the Museum of Mathematics in Manhattan (New York City), which opened in December 2012.
