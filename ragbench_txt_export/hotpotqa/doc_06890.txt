As Ugly as It Gets: The Very Best of Ugly Kid Joe is a 1998 compilation album by Ugly Kid Joe. It included select songs from the band's previous releases as well as a cover of the Black Sabbath song "N.I.B." (previously included on the tribute album "Nativity in Black"). Although this compilation album was released after "Motel California", it contains none of the singles from that album as Ugly Kid Joe had switched record labels by that time.
