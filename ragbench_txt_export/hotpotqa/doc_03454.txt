Parma Associazione Calcio did not manage to compete for a much-vaunted first Serie A title, which still proved elusive. In the summer following the end of the season, star striker Hernán Crespo ran out of patience, and signed with champions Lazio for a then-world record transfer fee, in a deal that saw Matías Almeyda and Sérgio Conçeicão join Parma. Parma did manage to hold on to Lazio targets Gianluigi Buffon and Lilian Thuram, maintaining hope that the club could break its duck in 2000–01.
