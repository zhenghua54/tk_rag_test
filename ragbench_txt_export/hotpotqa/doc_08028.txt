Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute (LHPAI) is an arts venue in Seattle, Washington, USA, operated by City of Seattle Office of Arts and Culture and named after African-American writer Langston Hughes. The building has Seattle landmark status. Dating from 1915, it was originally a synagogue, designed by B. Marcus Priteca for the Orthodox Jewish congregation Chevra Bikur Cholim, now Bikur Cholim Machzikay Hadath. As of 2009, it will soon undergo a US$2.5 million upgrade, including its second round of seismic retrofitting.
