"Wizard in Black" is the second track on doom metal band Electric Wizard's second album, Come My Fanatics.... On the original version of the CD, the beginning of the song features a sample from the 1974 zombie film "Let Sleeping Corpses Lie" (aka "The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue"), in which the Inspector (a character in the film) tells George (one of the teenage protagonists), "You're all the same, the lot of you, with your long hair and faggot clothes. Drugs, sexâ€¦every sort of filth. And ya hate the police, don't ya?" This is followed by George's reply, "You make it easy."
