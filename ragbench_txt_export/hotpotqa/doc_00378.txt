The National Convention Party (NCP) is a political party in Gambia. It was the main opposition party between 1975 and 1994. It was originally founded on 7 September 1975 when it first launched at Busumbala by former vice-president Sheriff Mustapha Dibba two weeks after his expulsion from the People's Progressive Party (PPP). It initially welcomed the 1994 coup but was banned from participating in elections in August 1994. Prior to the 1992 elections, the party faced a series of setbacks as many of its leaders rejoin the PPP. Its candidate at the presidential elections of 18 October 2001, Sheriff Dibba, came fourth with 3.77% of the popular vote.
