Robert George Mallaby Carter (born 11 July 1937), known as Bob, is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket for Worcestershire. He was capped by the county in 1965, and was awarded a benefit season in 1973, which raised about £7,000. All but two of his 523 first-class wickets came for Worcestershire; the others were obtained for MCC in the very last game of his career. Carter’s batting was generally extremely poor, as evidenced by his career batting average of under five in both forms of the game, although he did play one significant – if ultimately fruitless – innings. In the 1963 Gillette Cup final against Sussex at Lord's, he came to the wicket with Worcestershire 133/9, needing 35 runs to win. In fading light, he and wicket-keeper Roy Booth added 21 before Carter was run out to end the match. Carter also played in a critical close finish the following season against Nottinghamshire, where he and Flavell managed to get home by a single wicket and virtually seal the county’s first Championship title.
