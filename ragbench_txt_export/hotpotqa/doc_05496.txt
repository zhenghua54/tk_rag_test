John (Boss) Murphy (1875–1955) from The Leap, Churchtown, Co. Cork was a former farmer by profession, but possessed a keen interest in fiddle playing, and was renowned locally for his ability on the instrument. His father, William Murphy (1829–1911), was both a fiddle player and maker, indeed John was the proud owner of an instrument that had been made by his father. John’s father was his first fiddle teacher. His siblings, a brother and three sisters, also played the instrument but their interest in music waned as they reached adulthood and they did not continue to play. John’s musical literacy was also gained primarily from his father, who had learnt to read music at a hedge school at Ballygrace in the locality taught by a Thomas Croke. The same Thomas Croke, many years later, stayed for long periods of time in the Murphy household and would undoubtedly also have taught the young John directly.
