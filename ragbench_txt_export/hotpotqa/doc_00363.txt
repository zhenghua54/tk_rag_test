The 1986 WAFU Club Championship was the ninth football club tournament season that took place for the runners-up of each West African country's domestic league, the West African Club Championship. It was won again by Africa Sports after defeating Asante Kotoko from Ghana 6-5 in penalty shootouts as both clubs had two goals each in its two matches. A total of 45 goals were scored. Originally a 22 match season, as Sierra Leone's Real Republicans and ASC Police from Nouakchott, Mauritania withdrew, Asante Kotoko and Universit√© du Benin FC (or University of Benin FC) automatically qualify in the quarterfinals.
