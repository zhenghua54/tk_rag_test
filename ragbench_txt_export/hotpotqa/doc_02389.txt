Di'Anno is the 1984 self-titled album of the band of the same name. The lead singer Paul Di'Anno had been the frontman of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden for three years, before being dismissed for his erratic behaviour. The band bearing his name and playing very commercial heavy rock was his first and short-lived solo project.
