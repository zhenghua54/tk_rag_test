Contact, l'encyclopédie de la création is a television series originally broadcast by Quebec's public broadcaster Télé-Québec. Each one-hour program offers an up-close personal portrait of a thinker or creator. This new incarnation of the series is the brainchild of broadcaster Stéphan Bureau who initially created under the title "Contact" in the early 1990s. Each episode, which is usually shot over the course of two or three days, centers on interviews conducted by Bureau with the featured creator. The complete program is shot on location in settings that are meaningful to the subject.
