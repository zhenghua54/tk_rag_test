"Leslie and Ron" is the fourth episode of the American comedy television series "Parks and Recreation"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s seventh season, and the 116th overall episode of the series. It aired with the previous episode, "William Henry Harrison" , on the same day. The story picks up right where "William Henry Harrison" left off: the Parks & Recreation gang finds Leslie and Ron's rivalry cumbersome and locks them in a room together to hash things out. Because most of the episode only covers a short period of time, time cards appear during various points during Leslie and Ron's entrapment.
