Chach (c. 631-711 CE) (Sindhi: چچ‎ ) was a Brahmin who reigned as king of Sindh in the mid-7th century CE. A former prime minister to the king Rai Sahasi II, Chach ascended to the throne by marrying the king's widow. The Brahmin dynasty under Chach expanded the kingdom of Sindh, and his successful efforts to subjugate surrounding monarchies and ethnic groups into an empire covering the entire Indus valley and beyond were recorded in the "Chach Nama".
