Crucial FM was a fictional pirate radio station on the Lenny Henry comedy TV series on BBC 1. Henry played the character "Delbert Wilkins", a D.J who broadcast his shows from the back of a kebab shop in Brixton. The opening credits of the programme started with a mock jingle which sang "Brixton Broadcasting Corporation", thus mimicking the BBC.
