Live in Boston (a.k.a. "Boston Live" and "Jumping at Shadows") is a live album by British blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac. It was recorded over three nights at the Boston Tea Party venue in Boston, between 5 and 7 February 1970. The recordings were made for a proposed live album which was to have been released during 1970, but the project was shelved and the tapes remained unreleased until Shanghai Records issued seven songs from the performances as "Live in Boston" in February 1985. The album was reissued a few months later as "Jumping at Shadows" by Varrick Records and was re-released again in 1989 as "Boston Live" by Castle Communications. In addition, a number of other compilations featuring material dating from Fleetwood Mac's February 1970 residency at the Boston Tea Party appeared during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
