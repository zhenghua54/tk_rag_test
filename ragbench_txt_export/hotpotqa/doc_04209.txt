The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974 (No. 7/1974) was a law in Ireland which provided for parliamentary constituencies for the 21st Dáil Éireann. It was a review of parliamentary constituencies passed in Ireland by the governing Fine Gael–Labour Party National Coalition. It was intended to secure their re-election, but instead backfired disastrously resulting in a landslide victory for their main opponents in Fianna Fáil. Consequently, the word "Tullymander" – combining the name of the minister James Tully with the word "gerrymander" – was coined.
