Rome ( ; Italian: "Roma" ] , Latin: "R≈çma" ) is the capital of Italy and a special comune (named "Comune di Roma Capitale"). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With 2,877,215 residents in 1285 km2 , it is also the country's most populated comune. It is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the center of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4.3 million residents. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.
