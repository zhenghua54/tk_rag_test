Hella Kemper (born 2 February 1959 in Gummersbach) known by her stage name Hella von Sinnen (lit. "Hella out of [her] mind", making pun of the aristocratic "von") is a German entertainer. She had several TV shows on German private channels (mainly RTL Group). Since the show's first air date on 11 January 2003, she has formed (together with Bernhard Hoëcker) the two permanent panel members of the award-winning weekly Sat.1 improvisational comedy show "Genial daneben" (lit. "ingeniously off the mark") presented by her main TV partner Hugo Egon Balder. In this show, von Sinnen, Hoëcker and three varying comedians try to answer strange questions sent in by the audience. Her stage name is a pun on the German "von" preposition denoting noble descent; "von Sinnen" is a German expression for "mad or insane".
