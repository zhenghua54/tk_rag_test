Goats Head Soup is the 11th British and 13th American studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in August 1973. Like its predecessor, "Exile on Main St.", the band composed and recorded it outside of the United Kingdom due to tax issues. "Goats Head Soup" was recorded in Jamaica and the Netherlands. The album contained 10 tracks, all written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, including lead single "Angie", which went to No. 1 as a single in the United States and top 5 in the UK. "Goats Head Soup" received positive reviews and achieved number one chart positions in the UK, US, and several other World markets. The album was remastered and released in 1994 and again in 2009 by Virgin Records and Universal Music respectively.
