Yseult Island is a small rocky island 0.7 nmi east of Tristan Island and 0.4 nmi north of the east point on Cape Jules. Photographed from the air by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946-47. Charted by the French Antarctic Expedition under Barre, 1951â€“52, and so named because of its twin relationship with Tristan Island. Yseult is the French spelling of Isolde, legendary heroine incorporated into Arthurian legend and later popularized by Richard Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde".
