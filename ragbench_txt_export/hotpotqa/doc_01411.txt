UFC Fight Pass is a subscription-based video streaming service owned by the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The UFC Fight Pass consists of both a 24-hour linear streaming channel and on-demand programming from UFC's library. UFC on-demand content launched for Xbox 360 on December 20, 2011. Subscribers are able to view pay-per-view events in high definition, connect with friends to predict fight results, and have the ability to compare fighter statistics and records. The UFC Fight Pass application was also planned for PlayStation 4 in early 2015.
