Final Fantasy XII (ファイナルファンタジーXII , Fainaru Fantajī Tuerubu ) is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 home video console. Released in 2006, it is the twelfth title in the mainline "Final Fantasy" series. The game introduced several innovations to the series: an open world split into zones, a seamless battle system, a controllable camera, a customizable "gambit" system which lets the player control the artificial intelligence (AI) of characters in battle; and a "license" system that determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters. "Final Fantasy XII" also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as Chocobos and Moogles.
