Troubadour is the twenty-fifth studio album by American country music singer George Strait. It was released on April 1, 2008 (see 2008 in country music) on MCA Nashville Records. The album comprises twelve tracks, including two duets. The lead-off single, "I Saw God Today", was the highest-debuting single of Strait's career, and his forty-third Number One on the "Billboard" country charts. The album has been certified platinum by the RIAA. At the 51st Grammy Awards, "Troubadour" earned the Grammy Award for Best Country Album, the first Grammy win of Strait's career. The album was intended to include the song "Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven", but after Strait decided not to include it on the album, it was later recorded by Kenny Chesney, and was released as the first single from his album "Lucky Old Sun".
