Quaker Ridge is a former railroad station on the White Plains branch of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway in the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. The station is named for the Quaker Ridge section of northern New Rochelle along the Scarsdale Town border. It was constructed by the New York, Westchester & Boston commuter railroad which linked Manhattan with the less populous northern Bronx section of New York City and the primarily undeveloped countryside of Westchester County.
