The Zimmerman House is a house located at 223 Heather Street, in a residential area of the north end of Manchester, New Hampshire. It is a usonian house designed in 1950 by Frank Lloyd Wright for Dr. Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman. It is a single-story structure, organized around a large L-shaped central chimney, and covered by a deeply overhanging roof. The rooms are arranged in a single line (except one). Wright redesigned the house around a rock just outside the front entrance. Most of its Wright-designed interior features are intact, including concrete floors, cypress woodwork finishes, and fabrics. Wright designed a special music stand for four musicians. Tours through the building are operated by the Currier Museum of Art.
