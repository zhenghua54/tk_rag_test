OSRIC, short for Old School Reference and Index Compilation, is a fantasy role-playing game system. "OSRIC" is a recreation of the first edition of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons", and one of the most successful retro-clones. "OSRIC" describes itself as "a compilation of rules for old school-style fantasy gaming...intended to reproduce underlying rules used in the late 1970s to early 1980s". OSRIC uses the Open Gaming License and the System Reference Document of "Dungeons & Dragons" 3rd edition to create a new artistic presentation of the underlying rules set.
