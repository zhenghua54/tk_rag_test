Nicaragua Airways is the potential future national flag carrier of Nicaragua. Its main base is Augusto C. Sandino International Airport, Managua. It is the first time in 20 years that Nicaragua will have a national flag carrier, after Aeronica ceased operations in 1991. Since then, the flag carrier status was awarded to Nicaragüense de Aviación also known as NICA Airlines. Several airlines had tried to become the Nicaraguan flag carrier like CAAL (Central American Airlines), SANSA (Servicios Aereos Nicaraguenses S.A.) but none of these survived a year. Today even NICA Airlines (6Y) is registered as the national airline of Nicaragua, the only international flight it operated once (Managua to Miami) and is done under the TACA code (TA) as a full TACA Airlines flight.
