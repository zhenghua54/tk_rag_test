USS "Daedalus" (ARL-35) was one of 39 "Achelous"-class landing craft repair ships built for the United States Navy during World War II. Named for Daedalus (in Greek mythology, an exiled Athenian who served in the courts of Minos and Kokalos, regarded as representative of artists and artisans of the later Minoan or Mykenaian age; imprisoned by Minos, he made wings to escape), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.
