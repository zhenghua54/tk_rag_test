The ride was planned to be 160 ft high, but the park's executives rejected this and the height was changed to 200 ft . SheiKra reaches a maximum speed of 70 mph and has a total track length of 3188 ft . It first opened on May 21, 2005, and was converted to a floorless roller coaster on June 16, 2007, following the opening of its sister Dive Coaster Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg that year.
