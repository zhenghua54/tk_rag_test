The 8×68mm S rebated rim bottlenecked centerfire rifle cartridge (the S denoting it is intended for 8.2 mm (.323 in) groove diameter bullets) and its necked-down sister cartridge, the 6.5×68mm (no S, or other modifier required), were developed in the 1930s by August Schüler of the "August Schüler Waffenfabrik, Suhl, Germany" as magnum hunting cartridges that would just fit and function in standard-sized Mauser 98 bolt-action rifles. This is one of the early examples where a completely new rifle cartridge (the 8×68mm S and 6.5×68mm have no other cartridge as parent case) was developed by a gunsmith to fit a specific popular and widespread type of rifle.
