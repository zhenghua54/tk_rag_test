In Norse mythology, Sága (] , possibly meaning "seeress") is a goddess associated with the wisdom Sökkvabekkr (] ; "sunken bank", "sunken bench", or "treasure bank"). At Sökkvabekkr, Sága and the god Odin merrily drink as cool waves flow. Both Sága and Sökkvabekkr are attested in the "Poetic Edda", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the "Prose Edda", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess and her associated location, including that the location may be connected to the goddess Frigg's fen residence Fensalir and that Sága may be another name for "Frigg".
