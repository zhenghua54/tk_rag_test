Tokyo-Ga is a 1985 documentary film (shot in spring 1983) directed by Wim Wenders ostensibly about filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu. The film ranges from explicit focus on Ozu's filmmaking—Wenders interviews Ozu’s regular cinematographer, Yuharu Atsuta, and one of Ozu’s favorite actors, Chishū Ryū—to scenes of contemporary Tokyo such as pachinko and plastic food displays. Wenders introduces the film as a "diary on film." It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.
