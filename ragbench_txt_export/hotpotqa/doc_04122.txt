The Blackfin is a family of 16- or 32-bit microprocessors developed, manufactured and marketed by Analog Devices. The processors have built-in, fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) functionality supplied by 16-bit Multiplyâ€“accumulates (MACs), accompanied on-chip by a small microcontroller. It was designed for a unified low-power processor architecture that can run operating systems while simultaneously handling complex numeric tasks such as real-time H.264 video encoding. There are several hardware development kits for the Blackfin. Open-source operating systems for the Blackfin include uClinux.
