Form: The form used in On the Pleasure of Hating is a nonfiction essay. A nonfiction essay is a short, nonfiction narrative work of prose literature that is analytic, speculative, or interpretive in nature, dealing with or offering opinions or conjectures upon facts and reality, and written from the author’s point of view. On the Pleasure of Hating is seen as an essay because it is written to express Hazlitt’s point of view on the lack of sympathy that people have. For example, on page 189, Hazlitt proceeds to explain that,“We learn to curb our will and keep our overt actions within the bounds of humanity, long before we can subdue our sentiments and imaginations to the same mild tone.”Hazlitt gives this example as he is about to kill a spider. Hazlitt comes to the realization that the spider has done nothing to harm him. Why should he kill the innocent spider if the spider just means to be crawling from one place to another? Hazlitt tries to make the reader comprehend that society is the one that has placed pressure on hating things just to avoid us from hating ourselves.
