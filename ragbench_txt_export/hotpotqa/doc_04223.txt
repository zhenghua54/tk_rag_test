Marvel One-Shots are a series of direct-to-video short films produced by Marvel Studios, set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), released from 2011 to 2014. They are included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. Each of the films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for television series set in the MCU.
