Donald William Ashworth (born March 16, 1931) is a musician who was a member of "The Tonight Show Band" for thirty years before retiring in 1995. Ashworth played woodwind instruments with the group starting from Johnny Carson's first week as host of "The Tonight Show" in October 1962 (when the band was referred to generically as "The NBC Orchestra") until his final show on May 22, 1992. For its first 10 years, Carson's "Tonight Show" was based in New York City with occasional trips to Burbank, California; in May 1972, Ashworth moved from New York City to Southern California when the show moved permanently to Burbank. He was often seen on the show when Carson played "Stump the Band", where studio audience members asked the band to try to play obscure songs given only the title.
