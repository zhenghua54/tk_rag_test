Friday the 13th is an American horror franchise that consists of twelve slasher films, a television show, novels, and comic books. The main villain in the series is Jason Voorhees, who drowned at Camp Crystal Lake as a boy due to the negligence of the teenage counselors. Decades later, the lake is rumored to be "cursed" and is the setting for a series of mass murders. Jason is featured in all of the films, either as the killer or as the motivation for the killings. Each entry in the series features a different cast of characters, including a final girl who defeats the killer in the end. Recurring characters in the series include Jason's vengeful mother Pamela Voorhees, Alice Hardy, Tommy Jarvis and Crazy Ralph.
