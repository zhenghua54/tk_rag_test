The Kingdom of Bohemia, sometimes in English literature referred to as the Czech Kingdom (Czech: "České království" ; German: "Königreich Böhmen" ; Latin: "Regnum Bohemiae" , sometimes Latin: "Regnum Czechorum" ), was a medieval and early modern monarchy in Central Europe, the predecessor of the modern Czech Republic. It was an Imperial State in the Holy Roman Empire, and the Bohemian king was a prince-elector of the empire. The kings of Bohemia, besides Bohemia, ruled also the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which at various times included Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia and parts of Saxony, Brandenburg and Bavaria.
