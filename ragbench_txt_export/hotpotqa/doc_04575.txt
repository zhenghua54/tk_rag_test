Post is the second solo studio album by Icelandic musician Björk. The album was released in June 1995 through One Little Indian in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Unlike her previous release "Debut"—which was almost entirely produced by Nellee Hooper—"Post" is characterised by more collaborative efforts, including production by Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. Moreover, Björk co-produced every song on the album. "Post" received widespread critical acclaim from reviewers and was a commercial success, charting at number 2 in the United Kingdom and 32 in the United States. It was certified gold in New Zealand and Sweden, and platinum in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. "Telegram", a remix album of songs from "Post", was released in 1996.
