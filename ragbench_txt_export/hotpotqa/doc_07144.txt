Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions. Common names include tarul, karkala ko ganu, elephant-ear, taro, cocoyam, dasheen, chembu, champadhumpa, shavige gadde, and eddoe. Elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved genera in the Araceae, notably "Xanthosoma" and "Caladium". The generic name is derived from the ancient Greek word "kolokasion", which in the Greek botanist Dioscorides (1st century AD) meant the edible roots of both "Colocasia esculenta" and "Nelumbo nucifera". It is thought that the edible roots of "Colocasia esculenta" have been cultivated in Asia for more than ten thousand years. The species "Colocasia esculenta" is an invasive species in wetlands along the American Gulf coast, where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.
