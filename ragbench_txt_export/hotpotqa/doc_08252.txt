The "Happy Fun Ball" was the subject of a series of parody advertisements on "Saturday Night Live". Described as a "classic that can sit right up there with Dan Aykroyd's Bass-o-Matic", it originally aired February 16, 1991 on NBC and was brought back for several "Best Of" specials. The topic of the skit is a toy rubber ball, the advertisement for which is accompanied by a long series of bizarre disclaimers and warnings, including "Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball".
