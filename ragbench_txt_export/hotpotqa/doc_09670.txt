Michael Romanoff, pseudonym for Harry F. Gerguson, born Hershel Geguzin, (February 20, 1890 â€“ September 1, 1971) was a Hollywood restaurateur, conman, and actor born in Lithuania. He is perhaps best known as the owner of the now-defunct Romanoff's, a Beverly Hills restaurant popular with Hollywood stars in the 1940s and 1950s.
