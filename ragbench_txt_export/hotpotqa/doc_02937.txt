Marie Antoinette syndrome is a sudden whitening of the hair. The event that named the syndrome was the observation that the hair of Queen Marie Antoinette of France turned stark white after her capture following the ill-fated Flight to Varennes during the French Revolution. Witnesses have alleged that Antoinette's hair suddenly turned white on three separate occasions. In the novel 'One hundred and One Dalmatians', by Dodie Smith, after the Dalmatians destroy Cruella de Vil's stock of furs, the shock renders her black hair white (and her white hair green). In Victor Hugo's novel 'Les Miserables' Jean Val-Jean's hair also goes pure white after the trauma of appearing in court in Arras. Other examples can be found in George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" series, where the character Theon Greyjoy's hair turns white and brittle from extended brutal torture.
