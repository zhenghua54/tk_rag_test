Basil Herbert Dean CBE (27 September 1888 â€“ 22 April 1978) was an English actor, writer, film producer/film director and theatrical producer/director. He is perhaps best remembered for the Entertainments National Service Association or ENSA, an organisation set up in 1939 by Dean and Leslie Henson to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during World War II.
