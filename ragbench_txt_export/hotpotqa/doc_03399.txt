Trot (Korean 트로트 "teuroteu"; sometimes called 뽕짝 "ppongjjak" due to its distinctive background rhythm) is a genre of Korean pop music, and is recognized as the oldest form of Korean pop music. Formulated during the Japanese rule in the early 1900s, the genre has been influenced by Japanese, Western and Korean musical elements. Also, the genre has adopted different names, such as "yuhaengga", "ppongjjak", and most recently "teuroteu" (the Korean pronunciation of the word trot). While the genre’s popularity declined during the 1990s, most recently, it has been subject to revivals by contemporary South Korean pop artists such as Jang Yoon Jeong, Super Junior-T, BIGBANG member Daesung, Red Velvet member Joy, and Trot Queen Hong Jin-young.
