Pentastar: In the Style of Demons is the third full-length studio album by the drone doom band Earth. It has a more rock-oriented sound than their earlier drone doom work, although in a very minimalist style. "Peace in Mississippi" is a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song. The original vinyl release of this album has an alternative take of "Peace in Mississippi". The car depicted on the cover is a "Sassy Grass Green" Plymouth Barracuda with the car's iconic hockey-stick decal saying "Earth." The "Pentastar" named in the album title is an apparent reference to the brand logo of Chrysler, parent company of Plymouth and also a reference to the fact that this is the fifth CD by Earth (its predecessor being 1995's Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars).
