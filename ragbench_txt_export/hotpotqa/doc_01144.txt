Socks Clinton (Spring 1989 â€“ February 20, 2009) was the pet cat of U.S. President Bill Clinton's family during his presidency. As an adopted stray cat, he was the only pet of the Clintons during the early years of the administration, and his likeness hosted the children's version of the White House website. After Clinton left office, Socks resided with former Clinton secretary Betty Currie and her husband, owing to continuing conflicts with Clinton's dog Buddy.
