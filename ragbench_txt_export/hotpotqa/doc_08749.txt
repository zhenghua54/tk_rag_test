"Doctor Jones" is a song by Danish dance-pop group Aqua. Released as the band's fifth single overall, it was the follow-up to their most successful song "Barbie Girl" in many regions. "Doctor Jones" was a similarly pop-oriented hit which sold well across the globe and ended the assumptions that Aqua would be a one-hit wonder; although they would remain so in America as "Barbie Girl" was their only hit there until "Lollipop (Candyman)" was released and hit the top 40 on the Hot 100.
