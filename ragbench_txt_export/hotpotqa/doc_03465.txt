Miyako Bay (宮古湾 , Miyako-wan ) is a bay in Iwate Prefecture, in the northern Tōhoku region of northern Japan. It is a long and narrow, roughly triangular body of water extending southwest to northeast where it opens to the Pacific Ocean. The Omoe Peninsula (重茂半島 , Omoe-hantō ) forms its southern border and Cape Anegasaki (姉ヶ崎 , Anegasaki ) forms its southern border. This gives it an area of approximately 24 km2 .
