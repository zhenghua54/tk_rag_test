The Intel 8088 (""eighty-eighty-eight"", also called iAPX 88) microprocessor is a variant of the Intel 8086. Introduced on July 1, 1979, the 8088 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086. The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range were unchanged, however. In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit (EU)â€”only the bus interface unit (BIU) is different. The original IBM PC was based on the 8088.
