"Postcards from the Wedge" is the fourteenth episode of "The Simpsons"<nowiki>'</nowiki> twenty-first season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 14, 2010. In the episode, Homer and Marge once again try to discipline Bart after Mrs. Krabappel tells them that Bart has not been doing his homework, but Bart has a plan to manipulate Homer's strictness and Marge's sympathetic ear, which backfires when Homer and Marge see through the plan and decide to ignore Bart. These themes had been seeded in the previous season (e.g. "Double, Double, Boy in Trouble", and "The Good, the Sad, and the Drugly"), would culminate in the show's first ever true grounding, and the first to stand for the rest of the episode. It would also be the last episode to feature a grounding, until "The Marge-ian Chronicles" in Season 27, six years later (also written by Brian Kelley).
