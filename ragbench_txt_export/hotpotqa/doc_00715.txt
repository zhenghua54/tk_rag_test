Allen Norton was an American poet and literary editor of the 1910s and 20s. He and his wife Louise Norton edited the little magazine "Rogue", published from March 1915 to December 1916. The periodical, partly financed by Walter Conrad Arensberg, served as an early showcase for the work of Arensberg himself, Wallace Stevens, Mina Loy, and Alfred Kreymborg. Norton's 1914 volume of verse, "Saloon Sonnets With Sunday Flutings", was published by Donald Evan's Claire Marie Press. Heavily influenced by fin-de-si√®cle aestheticism, Alice Corbin Henderson remarked that his work, along with the poetry of Evans himself, represented something of a revival of that style. Poems in the volume included "Impressions of Oscar Wilde", "Modern Love" and "Mrs. Eddy: a Mask".
