Shaqtin' a Fool is a weekly segment from the television show "Inside the NBA", the postgame show of "NBA on TNT" following the conclusion of National Basketball Association (NBA) games airing on cable TV channel TNT. It first aired during the 2011â€“12 NBA season, when retired NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal voiced it upon joining the show and was created by Turner Sports producer Mike Goldfarb. It highlights humorous and uncommon basketball plays that have occurred during NBA games in the past week. O'Neal is the host and presenter, while the other analysts in studio react and provide commentary. Most often, those have been fellow "Inside" regulars Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley, but other "Inside" hosts have also participated, including Chris Webber, Grant Hill, Steve Smith and Matt Winer.
