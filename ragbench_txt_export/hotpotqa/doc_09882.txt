Hector Luis Fautario was a retired Argentine Air Force general. He was the General Commander of the Argentine Air Force from 1973 to 1975. Shortly prior to the 1976 Argentine coup d'Ã©tat, he was the government's only remaining loyal officer. He had drawn harsh criticism towards himself from the Army and Navy due to his vehement opposition to their repressive plans, and for his refusal to mobilize the Air Force against the guerrillas' strongholds in the north. He was General Jorge Rafael Videla's last obstacle on the way to power.
