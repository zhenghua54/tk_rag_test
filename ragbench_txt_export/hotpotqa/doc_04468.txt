Once Upon a Time is a nighttime spectacular at Tokyo Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. Similar to "Celebrate the Magic" and "Disney Dreams!", the Tokyo show premiered on May 29, 2014, and utilizes fireworks, lasers, fire, projection mapping, and searchlights during the 19-minute presentation. The Magic Kingdom version is shorter and excludes the use of fire and lasers.
