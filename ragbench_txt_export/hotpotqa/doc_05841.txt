The A. H. Bulbulian Residence is a house located at 1229 Skyline Drive, Rochester, Minnesota, United States. It was designed by noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright for Arthur H. Bulbulian, a pioneer in the field of facial prosthetics. It is down the street from the Thomas Keys House and not far from the James McBean Residence, all three examples of Wright's Usonian genre of architecture. The Bulbulian Residence is a one-story house built with one 120-degree angle, and is constructed of cement brick and cypress. The house has recently been restored to near-original condition.
