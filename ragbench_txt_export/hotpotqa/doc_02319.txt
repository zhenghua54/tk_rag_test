The Indigenous Team of the Century (Australian rules football) was selected to recognise the role of Indigenous Australians in the sport. It was announced in 2005 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first senior level game played by an indigenous player in the Victorian/Australian Football League, Fitzroy's Joe Johnson. The panel's final selection from a short-list of 35 consisted of 24 players, 19 of whom have represented clubs competing in the Victorian/Australian Football League, whilst the remaining five were picked for their record in either the South Australian National Football League or the West Australian Football League. Graham Farmer was named as the team's captain and Barry Cable was selected as the team's coach. Eight of the players were still active in the AFL at the time of being selected.
