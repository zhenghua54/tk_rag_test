Nelumbo nucifera, also known as Indian lotus, sacred lotus, bean of India, Egyptian bean or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. The Linnaean binomial "Nelumbo nucifera" (Gaertn.) is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the former names, "Nelumbium speciosum" (Willd.) and "Nymphaea nelumbo", among others. (These names are obsolete synonyms and should be avoided in current works.) This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances its seeds may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300Â years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.
