Louise Fitzjames was a 19th-century ballerina. She was born on 10 December 1809 in Paris, and danced at Paris Opera from 1832 to 1846. When Marie Taglioni dropped out of Meyerbeer's "Robert le diable" after a few appearances, Fitzjames took on Taglioni's role of the Abbess. She danced the Abbess over 230 times. She was criticized by poet Th√©ophile Gautier for her emaciated appearance. Other roles included those in "Le Dieu et la bayadere" and "La Jolie Fille de Gand" in 1842.
