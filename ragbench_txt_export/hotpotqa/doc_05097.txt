Bakumatsu (幕末 , bakumatsu , "the end ("matsu") of the military government ("baku", short for "bakufu" "tent-government")) refers to the final years of the Edo period when the Tokugawa shogunate ended. Between 1853 and 1867 Japan ended its isolationist foreign policy known as "sakoku" and changed from a feudal Tokugawa shogunate to the pre-modern empire of the Meiji government. The major ideological-political divide during this period was between the pro-imperial nationalists called "ishin shishi" and the shogunate forces, which included the elite shinsengumi swordsmen.
