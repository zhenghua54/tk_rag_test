Kurama Tatsuya (16 December 1952 - 26 January 1995) was a sumo wrestler from Yasu, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. He fought under his real name for his entire career, never adopting a traditional shikona. He made his debut for the Tokitsukaze stable in September 1968. He was called the "last disiciple of Futabayama," as the great yokozuna who had founded the stable died at the end of the year. He was ranked in the top makuuchi division for 62 tournaments from 1976 to 1988, reaching a highest rank of sekiwake which he held for one tournament in May 1978. He won two Technique and one Fighting Spirit prize, and earned two kinboshi for defeating yokozuna. He was a highly popular wrestler, and was regarded as one of the most handsome rikishi of his time (alongside Wakanohana II). He retired in September 1989, and was the oldest man in any of the professional sumo divisions at the time. His retirement followed a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Shikoroyama, but left his role in 1990 due to ill health. He became a tarento and sumo commentator, although he kept his illness secret from the public. He died of leukemia in January 1995 at the age of 42. His wife , an actress, wrote a best-selling book about their struggles with his illness.
