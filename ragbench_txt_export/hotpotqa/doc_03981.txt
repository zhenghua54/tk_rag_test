Janes is an English patronymic family name. Its root is believed to be from the possessive of the given name "Jan" (see "Jayne"), "John" or "Ian". In England, the name appears to have its densest roots in Bedfordshire and Gloucestershire as well as a few in the East End of London though migration has spread it across the country and the English-speaking world. There are two coats of arms associated with Janeses, one Gloucester-based and the other Kent-based. Janes is an uncommon given name.
