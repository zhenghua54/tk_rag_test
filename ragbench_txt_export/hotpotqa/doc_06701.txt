The Taensa (also Tensas, Tensaw, and grands Taensas in French ) were a Native American people whose early settlements, approximately 1,200 people in several villages, had their former locations in present-day Tensas Parish, Louisiana. The Taensa ultimately migrated as a result of Chickasaw and Yazoo hostilities, first lower down the river, but ultimately, protected by the French, to lands near the current eponymous Tensas river near Mobile, Alabama "ca." 1740. The meaning of the name, which has the further variants "TaÃ«nsa", "Taenso", "Tinsas", "Tenza" or "Tinza", "Tahensa" or "Takensa", and "Tenisaw", is unknown, although it is believed to be an autonym.
