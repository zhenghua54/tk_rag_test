A. Merritt's Fantasy Magazine was an American pulp magazine which published five issues from December 1949 to October 1950. It took its name from fantasy writer A. Merritt, who had died in 1943, and it aimed to capitalize on Merritt's popularity. It was published by Popular Publications, alternating months with "Fantastic Novels", another title of theirs. It may have been edited by Mary Gnaedinger, who also edited "Fantastic Novels" and "Famous Fantastic Mysteries". It was a companion to "Famous Fantastic Mysteries", and like that magazine mostly reprinted science-fiction and fantasy classics from earlier decades.
