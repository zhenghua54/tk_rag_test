Another Country is a studio album by singer-songwriter Tift Merritt. It was recorded in the summer of 2007, produced in L.A. by George Drakoulias, and released on February 26, 2008 by Fantasy Records. For her third album, Tift Merritt took hiatus with a piano in Paris and came home with her most personal and powerful songs to date. Merritt has described the writing as a plainspoken look at the distance we all attempt to cross: between two people, between one heart and the rest of the world.
