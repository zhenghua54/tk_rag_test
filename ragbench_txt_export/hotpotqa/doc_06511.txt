The Pan-Slavic colors — red, blue and white — were defined by the Prague Slavic Congress, 1848, based on the flag of Russia, which was introduced in the late 17th century. The tricolour flag of Russia was itself inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. Historically, many Slavic nations and states adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors, but rarely all three of them. List of Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include: Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Montenegro, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine have never adopted the colors.
