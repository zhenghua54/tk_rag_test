Lisburn Distillery Football Club is a Northern Irish, intermediate football club who are based in Ballyskeagh, County Down and play in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club, founded in 1880, originated in west Belfast, where it was based at Grosvenor Park at Distillery Street off the Grosvenor Road until 1971. After sharing Skegoneill Avenue (Brantwood) and Seaview (Crusaders) for some years the club moved in 1980 to a permanent new home at New Grosvenor Stadium, Ballyskeagh, County Antrim, on the southern outskirts of Belfast. The club was known as Distillery until 1999, when it changed its name to 'Lisburn Distillery' in an attempt to associate itself more closely with its adopted borough (now city) of Lisburn. The club colour is white. The club, a founder member of the Irish League in 1890, was relegated in May 2013.
