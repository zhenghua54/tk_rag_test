Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (1559 â€“ 16 April 1594) was an English nobleman and politician. He was the son of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby and Lady Margaret Clifford. Ferdinando had a place in the line of succession according to the Will of Henry VIII, after his mother, whom he predeceased. His sudden death led to suspicions of poisoning amid fears of Catholic plots to overthrow Elizabeth.
