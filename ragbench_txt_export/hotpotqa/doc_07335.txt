Le financier et le savetier (The financier and the cobbler) is a one-act opérette bouffe of 1856 with words by Hector Crémieux and Edmond About, and music by Jacques Offenbach, based on the poem by La Fontaine. In 1842 Offenbach had set "The Cobbler and the Financier" ("Le Savetier et le Financier") among a set of six fables of La Fontaine.
