Pagliacci (] ; literal translation, "Clowns") is an Italian opera in a prologue and two acts, with music and libretto by Ruggero Leoncavallo. It is the only Leoncavallo opera that is still widely performed. Opera companies have frequently staged "Pagliacci" with "Cavalleria rusticana" by Mascagni, a double bill known colloquially as 'Cav and Pag'.
