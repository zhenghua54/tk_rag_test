The Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) is the former name of the current National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL), a United States government-owned, government-operated laboratory. NUSTL is part of the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Effective December 1, 2009, EML was re-designated as NUSTL to reflect the Lab’s evolved mission and functions. NUSTL is the third name in the laboratory's history, following the Health and Safety Laboratory (HASL, 1953–1977) and the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (1977–2009).
