Ivalice (イヴァリース , Ivarīsu ) is a fictional universe setting primarily appearing in the "Final Fantasy" video game series. The world was co-created by Yasumi Matsuno and Hiroyuki Ito in 1995, and has since been expanded upon by several games as the "Ivalice Alliance" series. Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and the stories of "Final Fantasy Tactics", "Vagrant Story" and "Final Fantasy XII" are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.
