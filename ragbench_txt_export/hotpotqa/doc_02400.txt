The Pale of Calais (French: "le Calaisis" ) was a historical region in modern-day France that was controlled by the monarchs of England following the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346 and the subsequent siege. "Pale" is an archaic English term for "area, jurisdiction". The capture by the English is the subject of Auguste Rodin's 1889 sculpture "The Burghers of Calais". In 1558, the expanding Kingdom of France took the Pale of Calais in the aftermath of the Siege of Calais.
