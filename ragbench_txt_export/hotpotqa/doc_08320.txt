The Leonberger is a giant dog breed. The breed's name derives from the city of Leonberg in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. According to legend, the Leonberger was ostensibly bred as a "symbolic dog" that would mimic the lion in the town crest. It is in the Working Group for dog shows such as Crufts, but not at the World Dog Show.
