The Flight across the Ocean ("Der Ozeanflug") is a "Lehrst√ºck" by the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht, inspired by "We", Charles Lindbergh's 1927 account of his transatlantic flight. Written for the Baden-Baden Music Festival, it was originally entitled "Lindbergh's Flight" ("Der Lindberghflug") and premiered in 1929 with music by Kurt Weill and Paul Hindemith in a broadcast by the Southwest German Radio Orchestra under the direction of Hermann Scherchen.
