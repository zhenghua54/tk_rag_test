"Gravity" is the 2004 lead single from "Out of Nothing", the fourth album by English rock band Embrace. Written by Coldplay, the song was first performed live by that group in 2002. Ultimately, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin gave the song to Embrace, although Coldplay released their own version in 2005, as a B-side to the single "Talk".
