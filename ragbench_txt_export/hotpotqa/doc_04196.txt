The 2004 Florida Atlantic University Owls football team represented Florida Atlantic University in the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football season. The team was coached by Howard Schnellenberger and played their home games at Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Owls entered the season as a program in transition from Division I-AA to Division I-A for the first year. As per NCAA rule, programs moving up from I-AA to I-A must spend two seasons in transition, thus not being eligible for a postseason bowl berth nor a conference championship.
