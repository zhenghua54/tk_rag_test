Bigger and Blackerer: a 2010 album and DVD that stars American stand-up comedian David Cross. The album's title plays on Chris Rock's comedy album, "Bigger & Blacker", and the cover plays off of the popular art form of painting on black velvet, such as Velvet Elvis (and is reminiscent of the Ray Charles album "Ray Charles Greatest Hits"). Cross taped and recorded the album during two shows at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston.
