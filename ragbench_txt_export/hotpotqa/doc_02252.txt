The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Bulls' 34th season in the National Basketball Association. The Bulls won the Draft Lottery, and selected Elton Brand out of Duke University with the first pick in the 1999 NBA draft. During the offseason, the team acquired Hersey Hawkins from the Seattle SuperSonics, and re-signed free agents B.J. Armstrong and Will Perdue, who both won championships with the team in the early 1990s. However, the Bulls' struggles continued as they lost 26 of their first 28 games. At midseason, Toni Kukoč was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, as the team acquired John Starks from the Golden State Warriors in a three-team trade. However, after just four games, Starks was released.
