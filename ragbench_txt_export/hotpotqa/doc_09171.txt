Paulding is an unincorporated community in and one of the two county seats of Jasper County, Mississippi. It is the only unincorporated county seat in Mississippi. Settled in 1833, it was named by United States settlers in honor of Revolutionary War hero John Paulding. After its citizens refused to contribute to a new railroad, the community was bypassed in favor of Bay Springs, Mississippi, which was designated a railroad stop to the west and the second county seat. It attracted more development and industry.
