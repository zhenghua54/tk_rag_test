Mount Barney is a mountain within the Scenic Rim Region in south-east Queensland, Australia. It lies approximately 130 km south-west of Brisbane, not far from the Queensland - New South Wales border, and forms part of the McPherson Range. It is a popular destination for bushwalkers and campers. Mount Barney is the sixth or seventh highest mountain in Queensland and is often regarded as one of the most impressive parts of the Scenic Rim. The mountain consists of two main peaks, (East Peak and the slightly higher West Peak), and smaller subsidiary peaks. East Peak is probably the most popular destination for bushwalkers.
