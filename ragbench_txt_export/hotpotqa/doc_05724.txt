"Bon Ton Roula" (alternatively "Bon Ton Roulet") is a zydeco-influenced blues song first recorded by Clarence Garlow in 1949. The following year, it became a hit, reaching number seven in "Billboard" magazine's Rhythm & Blues Records chart and "helped introduce the Louisiana music form to a national audience". "Bon ton roula" (pronounced "bahn tahn roolay") is a phonetical approximation of "bons temps rouler", Louisiana Creole French for "good times roll" as in "Laissez les bons temps rouler" or "Let the good times roll", a regional invitation to join in a festive celebration.
