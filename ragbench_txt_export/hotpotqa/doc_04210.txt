Albert Lane (1873 â€“ 29 December 1950) was an Australian politician. He was born in Windsor, New South Wales, and studied at public schools. He became an accountant and business manager. In 1917 he contested the federal election as the unsuccessful Nationalist candidate for the safe Labor seat of Dalley. In 1922 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as one of four members for the seat of Balmain, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia. The seat was abolished in 1927. Lane contested the 1931 federal election as the United Australia Party candidate for Barton, creating history by defeating both the incumbent member for Barton, James Tully, and the member for Martin, John Eldridge, who, as a member of the Lang Labor breakaway party, was attempting to transfer to Barton. Lane held the seat until 1940, when he was defeated by future Labor leader H. V. Evatt. He died in 1950.
