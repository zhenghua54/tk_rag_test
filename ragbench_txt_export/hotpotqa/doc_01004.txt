The flag of Bremen (used by both the city of Bremen and the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen) consists of at least eight equal horizontal stripes of red alternating with white, and checked at the hoist. It is colloquially known as "Speckflagge" (bacon flag). The civil flag does not contain the coat of arms.
