Francesca Caccini (18 September 1587 â€“ after 1641) was an Italian composer, singer, lutenist, poet, and music teacher of the early Baroque era. She was also known by the nickname "La Cecchina", originally given to her by the Florentines and probably a diminutive of "Francesca". She was the daughter of Giulio Caccini. Her only surviving stage work, "La liberazione di Ruggiero", is widely considered the oldest opera by a woman composer.
