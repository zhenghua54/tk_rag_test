English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician. One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", contributing to their second one, "A Saucerful of Secrets", and recording several unreleased songs with the band. Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour. After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972.
