The 6th Asian Games were held from December 9, 1970, to December 20, 1970, in Bangkok, Thailand. Originally Seoul, South Korea was selected to host the 6th Games but it declined due to both financial reasons and security threats from neighboring North Korea but eventually the city finally hosted in 1986. Previous host Thailand stepped in to save the Asiad and staged the Games using the funds of South Korea. A total number of 2,400 athletes, coming from 18 countries, competed in this Asiad, where yachting made its debut.
