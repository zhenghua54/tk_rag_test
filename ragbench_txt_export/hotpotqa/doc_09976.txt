The Power of Three, on The WB series "Charmed", refers to any bond formed by three magical beings good or evil. It is most commonly used to describe the bond between the Warren/Halliwell line, more specifically the Charmed Ones, which is said to be the most powerful magical force in history. The "Power of Three" originally included the Halliwell sisters Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano). However, following Prue's death in the third season finale, their long-lost younger half sister Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan) takes her place within the "Power of Three" from season four onwards.
