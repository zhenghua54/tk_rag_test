The Salzburg Festival (German: "Salzburger Festspiele" ) is a prominent festival of music and drama established in 1920. It is held each summer (for five weeks starting in late July) within the Austrian town of Salzburg, the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. One highlight is the annual performance of the play "Jedermann" ("Everyman") by Hugo von Hofmannsthal.
