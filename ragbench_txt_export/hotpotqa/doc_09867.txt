Sligo Creek is a free-flowing tributary of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River in Maryland. (The Anacostia, in turn, feeds into the Potomac River and eventually empties into the Atlantic Ocean via Chesapeake Bay.) The creek is approximately 9.1 mi long, with a drainage area of about 11.6 sqmi . It also inspired Katherine Paterson to write the Newbery Medal award-winning book Bridge to Terabithia.
