Securinega is a genus of plants in the family Phyllanthaceae, first described as a genus in 1789. As presently conceived, the genus is native to Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. In the past, it was considered to be much more widespread, thus explaining the long list of species formerly included.
