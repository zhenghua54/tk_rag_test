East High School is a public high school serving the sixth through twelfth grade in Rochester, N.Y, and is part of the Rochester City School District, and in partnership with the University of Rochester as the school's Educational Partnership Organization (EPO). The school opened in 1902 on 410 Alexander St, and was designed by noted Rochester architect J. Foster Warner. The school was later moved in 1959 to its current location, 1801 East Main Street. Since 2002, changes have occurred, including the re-addition of a junior high and the splitting of the school into separate academies.
