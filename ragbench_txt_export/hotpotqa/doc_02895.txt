Japan Air System Co., Ltd. (JAS) (日本エアシステム , "Nihon Ea Shisutemu" ) (IATA: JD, ICAO: JAS, Call sign: Air System) was the smallest of the big three Japanese airlines. In contrast to JAL and ANA, its international route network was very small, but its domestic network incorporated many smaller airports that were not served by the two larger airlines. As an independent company, it was last headquartered in the JAS M1 Building at Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) in Ōta, Tokyo. It has since merged with Japan Airlines.
