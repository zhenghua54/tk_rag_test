The Arrowverse is a shared fictional universe that is centered on television series airing on The CW, developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, Andrew Kreisberg, Phil Klemmer, and Geoff Johns, based on characters appearing in publications by DC Comics. The shared universe, much like the DC Universe in comic books or the cinematic DC Extended Universe, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The Arrowverse stars Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow, Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / Flash, Megalyn Echikunwoke as Mari Jiwe McCabe / Vixen, with an ensemble cast leading "Legends of Tomorrow", including Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, Caity Lotz as Sara Lance / White Canary, Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer / Atom, Dominic Purcell as Mick Rory / Heat Wave, with Victor Garber and Franz Drameh as Martin Stein & Jefferson "Jax" Jackson / Firestorm. Russell Tovey stars as Ray Terrill / The Ray.
