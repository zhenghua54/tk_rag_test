Treasure Island Resort & Casino began as a bingo hall in 1984 called Island Bingo. This building started as a 30,000-square-foot space that seated 1,400 people. Through its time of success it began to grow further into Treasure Island after Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. This act required states to negotiate gaming compacts with the Tribe as a way to strengthen tribal governments and improve the quality of life on reservations. This act contributed to much tribal success for Prairie Island Indian Community in addition to the entire state of Minnesota. Shortly after this in 1989, Prairie Island Indian Community signed a compact with the State of Minnesota which allowed it to expand its gaming operation. In 1991, the 30,000-square-foot building was expanded with a 25,000-square-foot addition that created room for additional games. Not long after this in 1992, the casino was expanded by an additional 25,000 square feet. Growth in the Prairie Island Indian Community was shown through this with the opening of a community center, health care facility as well as improvement to tribal water and sewer systems. In 1993, a 78,000-square-foot expansion was added which created three new restaurants, valet parking, state-of-the-art kitchen, a gift shop, players club, ballroom and a new entertainment area. In the following year, a 137-slip marina and 95-site RV park would open. Growth continued as 9,854-square-foot addition for business offices is established in 1995. In 1996, Treasure Island made a big step with a $20 million addition and redesign. A strategic marketing shift changed the name to Treasure Island Resort & Casino with the addition of new theming and a 250-room hotel transformed Treasure Island into a destination resort. The total square footage has 350,000 with 25,000 square feet designed for meeting space. In 2001, an additional 200,000 feet were added to the casino, which included a new great entry, higher ceilings to improve air quality, additional games, 70,000-square-foot office space and 60,000-square-foot warehouse. An expansion that was completed in fall 2008 included 230 new hotel rooms, 30,000-square-foot event center and a bowling center complete with an arcade area. In 2015, Tado Steakhouse was constructed, Tradewinds Buffet was remodeled and the water park & spa construction began. The Lagoon and Wave Spa opened February 9, 2016.
