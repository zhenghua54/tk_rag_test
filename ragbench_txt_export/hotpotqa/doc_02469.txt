Gerard ( or ; Old French: ] ) is a male forename of Proto-Germanic origin, variations of which exist in many Germanic and Romance languages. Like many other early Germanic names, it is dithematic, consisting of two meaningful constituents put together. In this case, those constituents are "gari" > "ger-" (meaning 'spear') and -"hard" (meaning 'hard/strong/brave').
