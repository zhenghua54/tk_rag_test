The afternoon movie was a popular practice of local television stations from the 1950s through the 1970s. It consisted of the daily weekday showing of old films usually between 12:30 and 2:00 P.M; if the film ran two hours or more, it was split into two parts. Atlanta local station WSB-TV, for instance, would show films in this time slot under the umbrella title "Armchair Playhouse". Popular titles, such as the 1953 "House of Wax", "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" (also 1953), the 1935 "Mutiny on the Bounty", the 1949 "The Secret Garden", or "National Velvet" (1944), would often turn up as afternoon movies (years later, in 1978, "National Velvet" was shown on network television, by CBS). During the Christmas season, such films as "Gulliver's Travels" (1939), "" (1954), or "A Christmas Carol" (1938) would sometimes be telecast on local stations after the network telecast of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
