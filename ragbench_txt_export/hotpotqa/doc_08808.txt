The Division of Fawkner was an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. The division was created in 1906 as a replacement for Southern Melbourne, and was abolished itself in 1969. It was named for John Pascoe Fawkner, one of the founders of Melbourne. It was located in the inner southern suburbs of Melbourne, including at various times Prahran, South Yarra, St Kilda and Toorak. It was usually a safe conservative seat, but was occasionally won by the Australian Labor Party.
