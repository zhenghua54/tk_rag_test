Pickpocket is a 1959 French film directed by Robert Bresson, generally believed to have been inspired by the novel "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It stars the young Uruguayan Martin LaSalle, who was a nonprofessional actor at the time, in the title role, with Marika Green as the ing√©nue. It was the first film for which Bresson wrote an original screenplay rather than "adapting it from an existing text."
