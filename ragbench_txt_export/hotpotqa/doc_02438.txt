A Cry Farewell is an American rap metal/nu metal band formed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2009. The band's musical style evolved from a hard rock sound to more of a rap metal sound by the following year. Following the release of "The Offering" and hit single "Nothing Left" in 2010, the band was featured by The New Review as one of the fastest rising hard rock acts in the nation. Since their formation, they've completed a national tour with Digital Summer and Universal/Republic records artist 10 Years, released a 5 track EP entitled "The Offering", and have had 3 of their songs ("Nothing Left", "Open My Eyes" and "The Road") appear on numerous national radio stations, including Sirius XM Radio. "The Offering" was produced by grammy nominated producer Travis Wyrick (P.O.D., 10 Years, Disciple), who also produced their brand new full length album "The War Goes On" which came out on December 20, 2011.
