The Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a sport utility vehicle that was manufactured and marketed by Jeep from 1983 to 2001. Sharing the name of the original full-size SJ model, but without a traditional body-on-frame chassis, the XJ instead featured a light-weight unibody design, The models were originally marketed as Sportwagons and became the precursor to the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) as that term was not yet in use.
