Candelario Duvergel (1963 - 17 June 2016) was an amateur boxer from Cuba. Duvergel is better known for winning 2 consecutive Pan American Games gold medals in the light welterweight division. Duvergel was renowned for his counter-attacking prowess. He won 8 Cuban national championships but he had trouble replicating his success in international competitions, despite regularly defeating other Cuban amateur champions like Juan Carlos Lemus. Duvergel defeated Shane Mosley in 1991. Duvergel never competed in the Olympics, as Cuba boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Summer Olympics.
