Richmond Hill High School is a four-year public high school in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York City, part of the New York City Department of Education. Richmond Hill High School was among over two dozen schools due to be closed from June 2012 due to persistently low academic performance. According to the schools last progress report, only 58% of all students were able to graduate on time, leaving many students to drop out. Responding to low academic performance, the NYCDOE hired a company called "High Schools that Work" at a cost of US$700,000 to help "turn around" the schools performance with little or no results. In addition to hiring a company to manage "turnaround", the NYCDOE planned to develop a new school at the site called the 21st Century School of Richmond Hill to improve the school. The new school would have a literacy and technology focus designed to interest students in internet based academic work.
