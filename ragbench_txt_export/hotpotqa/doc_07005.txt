"Génesis" is the name given to the third studio album by the Puerto Rican singer, songwriter and actress, Mary Ann Acevedo, released in January 1, 2012 worldwide through digital download and in December 7, 2012 on compact disc. Originally the album was confirmed for release in February 2010 as "El Amor es la Solución", but with the birth of her daughter, Mary Ann had to delay the departure of the album to April 2010; then GT Musik announced the album release was delayed for a few months. She agreed that her homonymous first album was a continuation of her tenure in the third edition of "Objetivo Fama". On that album, the songs were chosen when Mary Ann left the reality show; in December she was released a special production titled "Cántale a tu Bebé".
