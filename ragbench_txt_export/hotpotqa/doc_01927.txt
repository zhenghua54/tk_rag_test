James Thurston Nabors (born June 12, 1930) is a retired American actor, singer, and comedian. Born and raised in Sylacauga, Alabama, Nabors moved to southern California because of his asthma. While working at a Santa Monica nightclub, The Horn, he was discovered by Andy Griffith and later joined "The Andy Griffith Show," playing Gomer Pyle. Nabors, Betty Lynn, Elinor Donahue, and Ron Howard are the last surviving regular cast members from that series. The character proved popular, and Nabors was given his own spin-off show, "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.."
