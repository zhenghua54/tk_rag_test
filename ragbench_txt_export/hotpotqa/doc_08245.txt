The traditional music of the Ndebele is characterised mainly by the widespread use of choral song accompanied by leg rattles ("amahlwayi"), clappers ("izikeyi") and clapping of hands. Compared with choral song, solo singing and purely instrumental music are of minor importance. Like the Shona, the Ndebele also use mouthbows ("umqangala") and gourd-bows ("icaco"), played mostly for self-amusement.
