Raymond Cauchetier (born January 10, 1920) is a French photographer, known for his work as the set photographer from 1959 to 1968 on many of the seminal films of the French New Wave. His photographs are an important record of the New Wave directors at the beginning of their careers, and of their unconventional and groundbreaking production methods. A 2009 profile of Cauchetier in "Aperture" magazine declared that his photographs "are themselves central works of the New Wave."
