Gjakmarrja (literally "blood-taking", i.e. "blood feud") or Hakmarrja ("revenge") refers to the social obligation to commit murder in order to salvage honour questioned by an earlier murder or moral humiliation. This practice is generally seen as in line with the Albanian social code known as "Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit", or simply the "Kanun" (English: "Code of Lekë Dukagjini" ).
