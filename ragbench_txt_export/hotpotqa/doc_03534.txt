The Collection at RiverPark is an outdoor lifestyle center located east of the 101 Freeway in Oxnard, California. The shopping center held its grand opening on November 15, 2012; and is anchored by Target, Whole Foods Market, REI, The Container Store, and a sixteen-screen Cinemark cinema. Originally meant to open in 2008, The Collection was delayed over several years due to the Great Recession.
