The Thrawn" trilogy, also known as the Heir to the Empire" trilogy, is a series of best-selling science fiction novels written by Timothy Zahn. They are set in the "Star Wars" expanded universe approximately five years after the events depicted in the 1983 "Star Wars" film "Return of the Jedi". The series introduced several notable characters, including Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Grand Admiral Thrawn, one of the more notable villains in the expanded universe. The "Thrawn" trilogy was followed by "The Hand of Thrawn", a two-book series (1997 and 1998) also authored by Zahn.
