Into The Mirror Live / Black Reflections is live promotional EP of the band Sanctuary recorded on May 12, 1990 at The Country Club in Reseda, California, during their "Into the Mirror Black" tour. Approximately 1000 CD copies of this were made and less than 500 were ever distributed to radio stations and record stores. Because of contractual problems with Epic Records, the full version was never released for public consumption. Epic Records destroyed 500+ copies of this CD. Warrel Dane has stated on several occasions that he has the master tapes and copyrights of the full show and intended to have it finally released. To date that has not happened. This CD has been heavily pirated over the years as a 2-on-1 CD with the Satan's Host "Metal From Hell" album on the notorious Reborn Classics record label.
