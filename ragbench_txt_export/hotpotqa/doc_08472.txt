Teletubbies say "Eh-oh!" is a hit single which was number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in December 1997. It remained in the Top 75 for 29 weeks after its first release and three weeks more after two re-releases and sold well enough to be certified as double-platinum. It is mostly a remix of the theme song from the hit BBC TV show, "Teletubbies". It was also a massive hit in the Republic of Ireland, peaking at number two. The Teletubbies have not had another such hit, making them a one-hit wonder. The song also reached #13 in The Netherlands, remaining in the Dutch Singles Chart for 13 weeks. The song contains two nursery rhymes, the Teletubbies hum along to Baa, Baa, Black Sheep and the flowers from Teletubbyland sing Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary.
