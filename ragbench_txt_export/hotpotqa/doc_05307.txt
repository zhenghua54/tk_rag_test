The Real Glory is a 1939 Samuel Goldwyn Productions action film starring Gary Cooper, David Niven, Andrea Leeds and Broderick Crawford released by United Artists in the weeks immediately following Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. Based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford and directed by Henry Hathaway, the film is set against the backdrop of the Moro Rebellion during the American occupation of the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century. According to "The World" news broadcast on Aug 18, 2017, the War Department withdrew the film in 1942. The Moros were US allies in World War II, and the film had inflammatory scenes such as the tossing of a Muslim into a pig pit.
