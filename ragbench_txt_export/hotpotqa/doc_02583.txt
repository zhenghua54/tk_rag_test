"Jared Has Aides" is the first episode of the sixth season of the adult American animated television series "South Park". It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 6, 2002. The episode was rated TV-MA in the United States, except on syndicated broadcasts, where it is rated TV-14 instead. In the episode, weight loss advocate Jared Fogle incurs the wrath of South Park after he announces that he lost weight because he has aides (misinterpreted as AIDS). This leads the boys to try to use Butters as their own advocate for City Wok. The episode also parodies the film "Philadelphia".
