The Dying Swan (originally "The Swan") is a solo choreographed by Mikhail Fokine in 1905 to Camille Saint-Saëns's "Le Cygne" from "Le Carnaval des animaux" as a "pièce d'occasion" for the ballerina Anna Pavlova, who performed it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last moments in the life of a swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" and has inspired non-traditional interpretations and various adaptations.
