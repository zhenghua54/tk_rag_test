The Black Squirrel Creek Bridge carries U.S. 24 over Black Squirrel Creek in El Paso County, Colorado. Prior to 2012, it was locally known as the "green bridge" or "old green bridge" -- a historic single-span, Parker through truss bridge that was completed in 1935 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Because it no longer met highway safety standards, the bridge was dismantled and replaced by a newer span in 2012.
