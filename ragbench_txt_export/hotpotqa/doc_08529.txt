The Border War (alternatively, Border Showdown) is the name of the rivalry between athletic teams from the University of Kansas and University of Missouri, the Kansas Jayhawks and the Missouri Tigers respectively. Athletic competition between the two schools began in 1891. From 1907 to 2012 both schools were in the same athletic conference and competed annually in all sports. "Sports Illustrated" described the rivalry as the oldest (Division I) rivalry west of the Mississippi River in 2011, but it has been dormant since Missouri departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference on July 1, 2012. Despite overtures from Missouri to continue athletic competition, no further games have been scheduled between the two schools.
