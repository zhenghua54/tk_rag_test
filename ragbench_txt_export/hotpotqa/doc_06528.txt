Star Crossed, is a three-issue comic book mini-series published in 1997 under the short-lived DC Comics imprint, Helix. Written and illustrated by Matt Howarth, "Star Crossed" recounts the surrealist tale of a deep-space romance between a genetically engineered Ã¼ber-woman and a sentient asteroid. Consistent with the performance of other Helix titles, "Star Crossed" failed to appeal to a broad readership and the poor sales figures which accompanied its publication coincided with a general downturn in the American comic book industry.
