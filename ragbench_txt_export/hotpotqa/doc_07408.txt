German Spitz is used to refer to both a breed of dog and category or type of dog. Several modern breeds have been developed from the German Spitz, and are either registered as separate breeds or as varieties of German Spitz. All the "German Spitz type" dogs are dogs of the Spitz type of German origin. The Gro√üspitz, Mittelspitz, and Kleinspitz breeds of "German Spitz type" are also called the German Spitz in English.
