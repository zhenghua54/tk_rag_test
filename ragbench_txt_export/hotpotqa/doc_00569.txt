The Jamestown Gateway Train Station, also known as the Jamestown Erie Railroad station, and the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad Station, is a historic train station located at Jamestown in Chautauqua County, New York. Although no longer an active railroad station due to a lack of passenger service in the area after a restoration done in 2011 the building currently serves as a bus transportation center and community space for Jamestown. The first train arrived at Jamestown on August 25, 1860 as part of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad.
