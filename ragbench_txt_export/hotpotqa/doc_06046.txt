The Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden in Adelaide, Australia, is a tribute to the pioneer women of South Australia. The garden was designed by landscape designer Elsie Cornish (1887-1946), and the statue created by Ola Cohn was unveiled by Lady Muriel Barclay-Harvey (the wife of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey) on 19 April 1941.
