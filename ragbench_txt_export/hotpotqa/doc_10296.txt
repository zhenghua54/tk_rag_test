Once Upon a Time is the sixth studio album of country/bluegrass singer Marty Stuart. The album is mostly acoustic, featuring mainly bluegrass songs and Marty Stuart's mandolin. It is a retrospective of Stuart's teenage work during his time with Lester Flatt and Nashville Grass; the "All Music Guide to Country" describes the album as "certainly a special compilation" of a "true musical treasure" that "documents the early years and provides a glimpse into the development of an artist of character and quality."
