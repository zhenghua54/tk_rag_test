Karl Matthias Friedrich Magnus Kraepelin (14 December 1848 Neustrelitz – 28 June 1915 Hamburg), was a German naturalist who specialised in the study of scorpions, centipedes, spiders and solfugids, and was noted for his monograph ""Scorpiones und Pedipalpi"" (Berlin) in 1899, which was an exhaustive survey of the taxonomy of the Order Scorpiones. From 1889–1914 he was Director of the "Naturhistorisches Museum Hamburg ", which was destroyed during World War II, and worked on myriapods from 1901–1916.
