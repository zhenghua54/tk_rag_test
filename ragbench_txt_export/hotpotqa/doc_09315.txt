"Playground In My Mind" is a 1973 hit song by Clint Holmes. It is a nursery rhyme-styled song which features a duet with record producer Paul Vance's son, nine-year-old Philip (died 13 December 2009, age 44) on the chorus. Written by Vance with Lee Pockriss, the song was released in the U.S. in July 1972 but did not reach the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart until March 24, 1973, when it rose to #2 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and stayed for 23 weeks. The song was granted gold disc status by the R.I.A.A. on July 3, 1973.
