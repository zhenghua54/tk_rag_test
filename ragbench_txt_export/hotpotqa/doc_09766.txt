A civic amenity site (CA site) or household waste recycling centre (HWRC) is a facility where the public can dispose of household waste and also often containing recycling points. Civic amenity sites are run by the local authority in a given area. Collection points for recyclable waste such as green waste, metals, glass and other waste types (including WVO) are available. Items that cannot be collected by local waste collection schemes such as bulky waste are also provided.
