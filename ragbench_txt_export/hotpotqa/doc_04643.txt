Muriel (French: Muriel ou le Temps d'un retour , literally "Muriel, or the Time of a Return") is a 1963 French film directed by Alain Resnais. It was Resnais's third feature film, following "Hiroshima mon amour" (1959) and "L'Année dernière à Marienbad" (1961), and in common with those films it explores the challenge of integrating a remembered or imagined past with the life of the present. It also makes oblique reference to the controversial subject of the Algerian War, which had recently been brought to an end. "Muriel" was Resnais's second collaboration with Jean Cayrol, who had also written the screenplay of "Nuit et brouillard" ("Night and Fog") (1955).
