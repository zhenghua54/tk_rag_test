The Kanmon Bridge (関門橋 , Kanmonkyō ) (Asian Highway Network AH1 ) is a suspension bridge crossing the Kanmon Straits, a stretch of water separating two of Japan's four main islands. On the Honshū side of the bridge is Shimonoseki (下関 , which contributed "Kan" to the name of the strait) and on the Kyūshū side is Kitakyushu, whose former city and present ward, Moji (門司 ), gave the strait its "mon".
