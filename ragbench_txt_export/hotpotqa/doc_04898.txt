An additur (Latin: "it is added to") is a legal term referring to the practice of a trial judge adding damages additional to the original amount awarded by the jury. It is not allowed in U.S. federal courts, as held by "Dimick vs. Schiedt", 293 U.S. 474 (1935). However, "Dimick" was decided before "Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins" (1938), which given the rarity of additur makes it unclear whether federal courts are bound by this rule when applying state law in diversity cases.
