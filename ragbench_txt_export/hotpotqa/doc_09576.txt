Korn is a nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1993 by James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria, Brian Welch, and Jonathan Davis. With the exception of a brief departure of Silveria due to a wrist injury, the band had always performed and recorded with its original five members. After the departure of guitarist Welch, the band formed a backup band to replace Welch's guitar playing and later Silveria's drumming after his departure in 2006. The band has also brought in other instruments that previously had not been used by the band such as keyboards and various percussion instruments and backing vocalists. Currently, the only original member not part of the current lineup of the band is Silveria.
