Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is the third major platform game installment in the "Rayman" series. It tells the story of how Rayman stops Andr√©, an evil black lum, from taking over the world with his army of sack-like "Hoodlum" soldiers. Unlike the game's predecessor, "Rayman 3" took a more light-hearted turn, it has sarcastic self-referential undertones and pokes fun at the platforming video game genre. It was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows by Ubi Soft in 2003 and OS X by Feral Interactive in 2004. A remastered HD version of the game was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2012. 2D versions were developed for the Game Boy Advance and N-Gage. A follow up game, "", was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005. This would be the last main series "Rayman" game to be released until "Rayman Origins" in 2011. The game is also the latest in the series to be in 3D.
