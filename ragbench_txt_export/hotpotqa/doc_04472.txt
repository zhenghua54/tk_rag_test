"Nasty Girl" is a song by rapper The Notorious B.I.G. It was released in 2005 in the US and on January 16, 2006 in the UK. The single reached #1 in the United Kingdom (this being his first #1 in the country, just under a year after "rival" rapper 2Pac had also achieved his first #1 there also with "Ghetto Gospel"). The song features guest appearances from Jagged Edge, P. Diddy, Avery Storm, and Nelly and the video also contains guest appearances from Pharrell, Usher, Fat Joe, 8 Ball & MJG, Teairra Mari, Jazze Pha, DJ Green Lantern, Naomi Campbell and Memphis Bleek. It can be found on the album "", a remixed album of Biggie Smalls' work. The lyrical section rapped by Notorious B.I.G is actually lifted from another of his songs called "Nasty Boy", featured on his second album "Life After Death". Despite this, the production to the song "Nasty Boy" is completely different from that for "Nasty Girl", and apart from the lyrical sample, and the second verse (rapped by P. Diddy) rapped in the style of Biggie's second verse of Nasty Boy, the two songs bear no similarities. The chorus, sung by Jagged Edge, which has the line "Grab your titties for B.I.G.", references "Player's Anthem", which he says "Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa".
