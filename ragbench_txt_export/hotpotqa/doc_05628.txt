Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) is an electroacoustic composition by Luciano Berio, for voice and tape. Composed between 1958 and 1959, it is based on the interpretative reading of the poem "Sirens" from chapter 11 of the novel "Ulysses" by James Joyce by Cathy Berberian and on the elaboration of her recorded voice by technological means.
