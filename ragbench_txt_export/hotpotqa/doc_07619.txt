An Erotic thriller is a film genre defined by a thriller with a thematic basis in illicit romance or erotic fantasy. Though most erotic thrillers contain scenes of softcore sex, the frequency and explicitness of those scenes varies. If a film is a thriller with scenes of softcore sex or nudity, it is probably not an erotic thriller unless illicit romance or erotic fantasy is central to the dramatic conflict, as in "Body Heat", "Fatal Attraction", and "Night Eyes 3". Many crime thrillers, action films, and slasher films contain softcore sex and/or nudity but are not erotic thrillers. Likewise, if a film is not identifiably a thriller, it is probably not an erotic thriller but simply a work of softcore erotica or perhaps even erotic melodrama.
