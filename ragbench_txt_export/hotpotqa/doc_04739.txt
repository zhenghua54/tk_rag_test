Wallace D. Fard aka Wallace Fard Muhammad (born February 26, 1877) was a co-founder of the Nation of Islam. He arrived in Detroit in 1930 with an obscure background and several aliases, and taught a distinctive form of Islam to members of the city's African-American population. He was also known as being a seller of silk, incense, and perfume and was described as a white Arab man, but remembered as being a "light-skinned" black man by leaders of the Nation of Islam. Fard was last seen in 1933 by Elijah Muhammad, when Fard took off in an airplane from the Detroit airport.
