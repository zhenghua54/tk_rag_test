The Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT), designated as State Road 821 (SR 821) and the Ronald Reagan Turnpike, is the southern extension of Florida's Turnpike, a toll road in Florida operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise (FTE). Spanning approximately 48 mi along a north-south axis, it supplements the 265 mi "mainline" (designated as SR 91) to form the complete 309 mi turnpike. The extension begins at its southern terminus at US Highway 1 (US 1) in Florida City, and transitions into the SR 91 mainline in Miramar at its northern end. Despite their designations as different state roads, the mainline and the extension are continuous in their exit numbering.
