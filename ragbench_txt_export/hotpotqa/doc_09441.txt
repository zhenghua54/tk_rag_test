A Kid in King Arthur's Court is a 1995 Disney family film directed by Michael Gottlieb. It is based on the famous Mark Twain novel "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" (previously filmed by Disney as "Unidentified Flying Oddball" in 1978 in which Ron Moody also played Merlin), transplanted into the twentieth century. Trimark later released a sequel, "A Kid in Aladdin's Palace", in 1998, but without Disney's involvement. Since Trimark's dissolution, the sequel is now distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.
