The Berber languages, also known as Berber or the Amazigh languages (Berber name: "Tamaziɣt", "Tamazight"; Neo-Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ, Tuareg Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗⵜ, ⵝⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗⵝ , ] , ] ), are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects spoken by the Berbers indigenous to North Africa. The Berber languages constitute a branch of the Afroasiatic family. They were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.
