"Time Pussy" is an early science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was the third of three stories Asimov wrote for John W. Campbell for a new category of science fiction tall tales in "Astounding Science Fiction" called "Probability Zero". Campbell rejected the first two stories, "Big Game" and "First Law", since they were not what he was looking for, but he accepted "Time Pussy", albeit unenthusiastically. Campbell also wanted to run the story under a pseudonym, since he wanted to encourage new writers to write "Probability Zero" stories. Asimov agreed, and chose the name George E. Dale at random. The story appeared pseudonymously in the April 1942 issue of "Astounding" and was reprinted under Asimov's name in the 1972 collection "The Early Asimov".
