Avenged Sevenfold is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California. Formed in 1999, the group originally featured vocalist M. Shadows (Matthew Sanders), guitarist Zacky Vengeance (Zachary Baker), bassist Matt Wendt and drummer The Rev (James Sullivan). Wendt was replaced early by Justin Sane (Justin Meacham), who performed on the group's debut album "Sounding the Seventh Trumpet" before leaving the band the following year after attempting to commit suicide. Dameon Ash (Frank Melcom) replaced Meacham for the album's promotional touring cycle, while lead guitarist Synyster Gates (Brian Haner, Jr.) joined the band after the album's initial release. Johnny Christ (Jonathan Seward) became Avenged Sevenfold's fourth bassist in time for the recording of the 2003 album "Waking the Fallen".
