World Assembly of Youth is a documentary film created in 1952 for the US State Department. It is believed to be lost but evidence for it was discovered on an early resume sent by Stanley Kubrick to veteran New York film critic Theodore Huff in February 1953. In the resume and covering letter, Kubrick lists working on this film alongside his other documentaries, "The Seafarers", "Day of the Fight", and "Flying Padre". The résumé was uncovered by John Baxter, while doing research for his own book, "Stanley Kubrick: A Biography".
