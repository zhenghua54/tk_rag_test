Vala Mal Doran is a fictional character in the American military science fiction television series "Stargate SG-1", a science fiction show about a military team exploring the galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices. Played by former "Farscape" actress Claudia Black, Vala was created by Damian Kindler and Robert C. Cooper as a guest character for the season 8 episode "Prometheus Unbound" (2004). Because of the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala and Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson, and the character's popularity with the producers and the audience, Claudia Black became a recurring guest star in season 9 (2005–2006) and joined the main cast in season 10 (2006–2007).
