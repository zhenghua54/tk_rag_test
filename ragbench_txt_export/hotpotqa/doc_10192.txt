Secotium is a genus of fungi in the family Agaricaceae. The members of this genus are closely related to ordinary "Agaricus" mushrooms, but do not open out in the usual way; this has given rise to the term "secotioid" for such mushrooms in general. They are thought to form an evolutionary link between agarics and gasteroid fungi (whose spores are enclosed in a pouch-like structure). "Secotium" is a widespread genus, with species that are predominantly found in warm and arid regions.
