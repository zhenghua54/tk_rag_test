Foxcatcher is a 2014 American true crime sports drama film produced and directed by Bennett Miller. Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire Du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist brothers Mark (Freestyle Wrestling - 82 kg) and Dave Schultz (Freestyle Wrestling - 74 kg) to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of Dave by John du Pont in January 1996. Although the film's action is largely set at Foxcatcher Farm, du Pont's now-broken-up 800-acre suburban Philadelphia estate, the majority of the movie was filmed in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
