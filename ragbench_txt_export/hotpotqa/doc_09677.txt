The RS-platform Chrysler minivans are a series of passenger minivans marketed by the Chrysler Corporation from model years 2001 to 2007, the fourth in six generations of Chrysler minivans, which were heavily revised versions of the NS minivans. Depending on the market, these vans were known as the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country and the Chrysler Voyager. With the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, the Plymouth Voyager didn't return.
