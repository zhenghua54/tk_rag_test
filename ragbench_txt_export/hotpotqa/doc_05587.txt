Tales from the Crypt is a 1972 British horror film, directed by Freddie Francis. It is an anthology film consisting of five separate segments, based on stories from EC Comics. Only two of the stories, however, are actually from EC's "Tales from the Crypt". The reason for this, according to "Creepy" founding editor Russ Jones, is that producer Milton Subotsky did not own a run of the original EC comic book but instead adapted the movie from the two paperback reprints given to him by Jones. The movie was one of many Amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s and features an all star cast, including Joan Collins, Peter Cushing, Richard Greene, and Roy Dotrice, with Ralph Richardson as the Crypt Keeper.
