Le roi l'a dit ("The King Has Spoken") is an opéra comique in three acts by Léo Delibes to a French libretto by Edmond Gondinet. It is a lively comedy, remarkably requiring 14 singers – six men and eight women. The libretto had first been offered in 1871 to Offenbach; the title also went through various permutations ("Le Talon rouge", "Si le Roi le savait", "Le Roi le sait") before settling on its final name. The 1885 revival brought further modifications to the libretto.
