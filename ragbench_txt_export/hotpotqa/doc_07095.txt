Troubles is a 1970 novel by J. G. Farrell. The plot concerns the dilapidation of a once grand Irish hotel (the Majestic), in the midst of the political upheaval during the Irish War of Independence (1919â€“1921). It is the first instalment in Farrell's acclaimed 'Empire Trilogy', preceding "The Siege of Krishnapur" and "The Singapore Grip". Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling.
