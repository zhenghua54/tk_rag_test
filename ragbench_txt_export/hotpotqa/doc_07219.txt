Calibanus is a genus of two species of flowering plants, both evergreen succulents from dry areas of northeastern Mexico. The APG III classification system places it in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae. ) It was formerly included in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae) but is now separated from them, for it is polycarpic and dioecious. Its name refers to the monster Caliban, an antagonist in Shakespeare's "The Tempest".
