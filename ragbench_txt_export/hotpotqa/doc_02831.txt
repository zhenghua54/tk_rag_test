Mexican Pets were formed by Pat Clafferty and Jill Hahn in Dublin, Ireland in 1990 inspired by American bands such as Hüsker Dü and Dinosaur Jr. The two soon drafted Derrick Dalton in on bass whose distinct and accomplished style was an invaluable contribution to the band's sound. The band never featured a permanent drummer and a string of players graced the stool including two guys called Eric, both of them American. Having made several demo recordings and playing extensive gigs around the country, they had their first break up. Each of its members pursued other musical interests until the spring of 1994 when they reformed. In that same year they found a permanent drummer in Fionan O Leary. Jill Hahn then moved to Manchester, replaced by Brian Gough on other guitar and organ. They recorded their first album "Nobody's Working Title" on Independent Records that summer and continued to play across the country.
