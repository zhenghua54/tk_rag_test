The 2006 Werribee DVD incident occurred in the Australian town of Werribee (a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria), when a group of teenage boys, who collectively called themselves the "Teenage Kings of Werribee", filmed themselves committing various criminal acts, including the sexual assault of a teenage girl with a developmental disability. They then produced a DVD of their actions, which they sold for $5 a copy, and posted their footage to YouTube under the name "Cunt: the Movie". The DVD caused widespread controversy after excerpts were broadcast by television current affairs program "Today Tonight" on 23 October 2006, and led to a police investigation about the content.
