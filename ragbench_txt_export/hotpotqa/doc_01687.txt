The 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment or Cocke's Arkansas Infantry Regiment (also known as "Johnson's regiment," "Hawthorn's regiment," "Cocke's regiment," and "Polk's regiment") was an infantry formation in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War, and was successively commanded by Colonels A. W. Johnson, A. T. Hawthorn, J. B. Cocke, and Lieutenant-Colonel C. Polk. It was mustered into service on June 17, 1862, at Trenton, Arkansas, remaining active through May 26, 1865. When Major-General Sterling Price's staff decided to designate all infantry regiments in the District of Arkansas as "Trans-Mississippi rifle regiments", the 39th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was designated as the 6th Trans-Mississippi Rifle Regiment. One other Arkansas regiment was designated as the 39th Arkansas Infantry; that regiment being successively commanded by Colonels Hart, McNeill, and Rogan. It was originally designated as the 39th Arkansas, but later redesignated as the 30th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The 39th served in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War and participated in all of the principal engagements in that department before disbanding on May 26, 1865.
