A breed standard (also called bench standard or the standard) in the dog fancy is a set of guidelines covering specific "externally observable" qualities such as "appearance", "movement", and "temperament" for that dog breed. Breed standards are not scientific documents, but are written for each breed by clubs of hobbyists called breed clubs for their own specific requirements. Details and definitions within breed standards for a specific dog breed may vary from breed club to breed club and from country to country. Dog breed standards are similar in form and function to breed standards for other domesticated animals.
