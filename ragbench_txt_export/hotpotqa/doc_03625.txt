Johannes Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes ("Liebeslieder-Walzer") are distributed across two opus numbers: Op. 52 and Op. 65. The waltzes are a collection of love songs in LÃ¤ndler style for voices and piano four hands. The lyrics for the "Liebeslieder" come from Georg Friedrich Daumer's "Polydora", a collection of folk songs and love poems. While there is no concrete record indicating the exact inspiration for the Waltzes, there is speculation that Brahms' motivation for the songs was his frustrated love for pianist Clara Schumann, composer Robert Schumann's wife.
