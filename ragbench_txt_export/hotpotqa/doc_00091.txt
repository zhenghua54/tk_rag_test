Achan (English: "Father" ) is a 2011 Malayalam-language film directed by Ali Akbar and starring Thilakan. The film is based on a drama of the same name written by S. R. Raveendran, who also scripted the film. The film's shooting began on 28 July 2010, and was scheduled to release by October. Several issues regarding the casting of Thilakan, an expelled member of the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists, led the film to a delayed release on 14 January 2011. Ali Akbarâ€™s wife produced the film; the music was composed by his daughter.
