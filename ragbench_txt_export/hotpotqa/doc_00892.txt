The Zoo Story is a one-act play by American playwright Edward Albee. His first play, it was written in 1958 and completed in just three weeks. The play explores themes of isolation, loneliness, miscommunication as anathematization, social disparity and dehumanization in a commercial world. Now, professional theatre companies can only produce "The Zoo Story" as a part of "Edward Albee's at Home at the Zoo" (originally titled "Peter and Jerry").
