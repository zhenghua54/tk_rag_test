The golden shiner virus is an aquatic virus that infects a bait fish known as the golden shiner and to a lesser extent, aquatic animals like crustaceans and molluscs. About 6 virus species have been identified in this genus since the late 1970s. It causes death through a hemorrhagic shock. Symptoms include bleeding from the back eyes and the head. The virus is 70 nm in diameter and replicates best at 20-30 degrees Celsius. The virus has properties similar to those of the pancreatic necrosis virus. This could mean that golden shiners are more susceptible in the summer.
