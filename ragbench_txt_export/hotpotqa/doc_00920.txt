Stitch's Great Escape! is a Tomorrowland attraction at the Magic Kingdom theme park within the Walt Disney World Resort. It is a "theater-in-the-round" experience starring the title alien from Walt Disney Animation Studios' 2002 film "Lilo & Stitch". It opened November 16, 2004 and is the fourth attraction to occupy the site in Tomorrowland. Many of the animators who worked on "Lilo & Stitch" partnered with Walt Disney Imagineering for Stitch's Great Escape! The attraction is a replacement of The ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, which formerly occupied the building the attraction is housed in. On September 21, 2016, it was announced that the attraction would be switching from a daily operated attraction to a seasonally operated one, depending on attendance, starting October 2, 2016.
