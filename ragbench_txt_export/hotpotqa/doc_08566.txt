Her father, Georgios Sokos, was a journalist, editor and playwright from Aitoliko who died at the age of 44, just before the war. Her mother Titika Michailidou came from Smyrna. Rosita-Maria-Zoe (her full name) was born in Athens, Greece, on 9 September 1923. Her grandfather, Fotis Michailidis, was a cinema and theatre fan and made her see all films and plays available every week, and Rosita started writing reviews of what she saw while in high school. Fotis Michailidis was also the co-founder of Greek pasta manufacturer MISKO in 1927. Rozita Sokou graduated from the Arsakeio School in Psychiko. During the war and occupation she perfected her French at the Institut Fran√ßais under Roger Milliex and English at the British Council (Cambridge Diploma of English Studies). She attended the State School of Fine Arts which she left to study with painter Yannis Tsarouchis - who later discouraged her from becoming a painter - and also attended the Vassilis Rotas Drama School for the purpose of general knowledge, while working from a tender age as a translator and a foreign language teacher. After the end of the German Occupation and Civil War, in 1947, she attended a summer course on 20th century literature at Lady Margaret Hall College in Oxford.
