Pipes of Peace is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Paul McCartney using his own name, released in 1983. As the follow-up to the popular "Tug of War", the album came close to matching the commercial success of its predecessor in Britain but peaked only at number 15 on America's "Billboard" 200 albums chart. While "Pipes of Peace" was the source of international hit singles such as "Say Say Say" (recorded with Michael Jackson) and the title track, the critical response to the album was less favourable than that afforded to "Tug of War".
