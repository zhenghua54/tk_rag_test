Roman René Ramírez (born June 11, 1988 in Fremont, California), better known as Rome Ramirez or simply Rome, is an American singer and guitarist best known for playing with Eric Wilson from Sublime and Josh Freese from The Vandals in the band Sublime with Rome. The lineup initially featured original Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh before his departure in 2011. Despite participation by Gaugh and Wilson, the family of deceased Sublime member Bradley Nowell legally challenged the use of the Sublime name by the surviving members. Nowell had actually registered the trademark "Sublime" under his own name prior to his death, and had sole ownership at the time of his death. The lineup featuring Rome, Wilson and Bud Gaugh released their debut album "Yours Truly" on July 12, 2011.
