"Fly Away from Here" is a power ballad by Aerosmith. It was the second single on their album, "Just Push Play". It was written by Aerosmith songwriters Marti Frederiksen and Todd Chapman. The song is a ballad about wanting to get away or escape with a loved one. It failed to make a significant impact on the charts, but did receive some airplay on adult contemporary varieties. The song is also featured in a slideshow of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
