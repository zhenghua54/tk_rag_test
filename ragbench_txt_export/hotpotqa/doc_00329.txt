Fabryka Samochodów Ciężarowych "Star" was a Polish truck manufacturer. The name comes from the City of Starachowice, where the factory is located. Their first vehicle was the "Star 20" in 1948. The most popular product was the "Star 266". The 266 model offered very good quality and powerful engines for a low price. It was sold in various countries for many years (not only in the Eastern Bloc; for example it was used by the Yemen Army). For many years FSC Star was a state-owned company. Star is now owned by MAN AG who eliminated the brand in January 2009.
