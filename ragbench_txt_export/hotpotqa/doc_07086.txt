Julia is a 1977 American drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann, from a screenplay by Alvin Sargent. It is based on a chapter from Lillian Hellman's book "Pentimento" about the author's relationship with a lifelong friend, "Julia," who fought against the Nazis in the years prior to World War II. Hellman said the story was true, but critics have challenged its accuracy. The film in DeLuxe Color was produced by Richard Roth, with Julien Derode as executive producer and Tom Pevsner as associate producer.
