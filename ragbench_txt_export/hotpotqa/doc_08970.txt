The Dallas Texans played in the National Football League (NFL) for one season, 1952, with a record of 1â€“11. The team is considered one of the worst teams in NFL history, both on (lowest franchise winning percentage) and off the field. The team was based first in Dallas, then Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Akron, Ohio, during its only season. The Texans were the last NFL team to fold. Many players on the 1952 roster went to the new Baltimore Colts franchise in 1953. The American Football League (AFL) had a 1960 charter member named the Dallas Texans (who later became the Kansas City Chiefs), but the AFL Texans have no relationship with the earlier NFL team.
