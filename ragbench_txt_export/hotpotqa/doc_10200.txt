Les Temps modernes ("Modern Times") is a French journal whose first issue appeared in October 1945. It was known as the journal of Jean-Paul Sartre. It was named after a film by Charlie Chaplin. "Les Temps modernes" filled the void left by the disappearance of the most important pre-war literary magazine, "La Nouvelle Revue Française" ("The New French Review"), considered to be André Gide's magazine, which was shut down after the liberation of France because of its collaboration with the occupation.
