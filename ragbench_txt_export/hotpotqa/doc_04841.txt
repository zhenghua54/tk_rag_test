The Calabrian black squirrel ("Sciurus meridionalis") is a species of tree squirrel in the genus "Sciurus", endemic to the forests of the regions of Calabria and Basilicata, in the south of the Italian Peninsula. It has been long considered a subspecies of "Sciurus vulgaris", the Eurasian red squirrel, but a 2017 scientific survey brought genetic evidence of being a distinct species.
