Cops 'n' Robbers is a game for home computers published by Atlantis Software originally in 1985 for the VIC-20 and in virtually identical form on the Commodore 64. It was ported to the Commodore 16/Commodore Plus/4 (1986), Acorn Electron and BBC Micro (1987) and the Atari 8-bit family of computers (1988). The game was controversial when released as the player is the "robber" and must shoot the "cops."
