Nepenthes bokorensis is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to Cambodia. It is known from Mount Bokor (also "Phnom Bokor" or Bokor Hill) in the south of the country, and an as yet undetermined specimen suggests that it may also be present in other parts of the DÃ¢mrei Mountains of Kampot Province. The specific epithet "bokorensis" refers to both Mount Bokor and Bokor National Park.
