Paul Hindemith ( ) (16 November 1895 â€“ 28 December 1963) was a prolific German composer, violist, violinist, teacher and conductor. Notable compositions include his song cycle "Das Marienleben" (1923), "Der Schwanendreher" for viola and orchestra (1935), and opera "Mathis der Maler" (1938). Hindemith's most popular work, both on record and in the concert hall, is likely the "Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber", written in 1943.
