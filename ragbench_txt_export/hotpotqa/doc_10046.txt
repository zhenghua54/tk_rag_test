Ghanam Krishna Iyar (1790â€“1854) was a composer of Carnatic music and was famous for his "padams". "Padams" are expressive songs of three of more stanzas, used generally as an accompaniment to classical dance. Krishna Iyar was a student of the famous composer, Pacchimiriam Adiyappa. He was also influenced by Tyagaraja and Gopalakrishna Bharathi. The title "Ghanam", which associated with music means 'deep' or 'grand', relates to his style of singing.
