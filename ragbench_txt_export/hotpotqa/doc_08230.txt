Murder, Misery and Then Goodnight is Kristin Hersh's third solo album and quite a departure from her other solo recordings, in that it contains solely Appalachian folk songs about murder and death arranged by Kristin Hersh, rather than songs written by Kristin herself. Hersh's son, Ryder James O'Connell, plays piano and sings backing vocals.
