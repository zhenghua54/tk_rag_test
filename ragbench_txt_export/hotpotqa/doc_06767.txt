Maha Kali is an EP by the Swedish extreme metal band Dissection. It was the first release after the rebirth of Dissection, shortly after Jon NÃ¶dtveidt was released from prison. It represents the band's change from a melodic black metal sound to a more Gothenburg-based sound of melodic death metal. The song "Maha Kali" also appears on the live DVD "Rebirth of Dissection", and was re-recorded and included on Dissection's last full-length album, "Reinkaos"; "Unhallowed (Rebirth Version)" is a re-recording from "Storm of the Light's Bane". "Maha Kali" entered the Swedish charts at number 50.
