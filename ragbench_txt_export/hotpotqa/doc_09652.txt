"A Man Has Dreams" is a song from Walt Disney's film "Mary Poppins", written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song melody is a slowed down version of "The Life I Lead" which serves as Banks's leitmotif as he was fired. In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson). It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era. The song incorporates a reprise of "A Spoonful of Sugar" which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif.
