Christine Marie Lundy, 38, and her 7-year-old daughter Amber Grace Lundy were murdered in Palmerston North, New Zealand, on 29 August 2000. Mark Edward Lundy (then age 43), Christine's husband and Amber's father, was arrested and charged with the murders in February 2001. In 2002 he was convicted of the murders after a six-week trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years. He appealed the conviction to the Court of Appeal; the appeal was rejected and the court increased his non-parole period to 20 years. In June 2013 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council heard a further appeal, with the decision reserved after the three day hearing. In October 2013 the Privy Council unanimously allowed his appeal, quashed the convictions and ordered a re-trial. In April 2015 a second jury re-convicted him.
