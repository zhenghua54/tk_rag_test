The Shahumyan Region (Armenian: Շահումյան ) is a disputed region, formerly a district of Azerbaijan SSR outside Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Before the Nagorno-Karabakh War of the 1990s, the district had a substantial Armenian population. The eastern part of the territory remains under the control of Azerbaijan and is incorporated into Goranboy District, but the area is claimed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.
