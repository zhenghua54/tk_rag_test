Stardust Memorial Park (Irish: An Pháirc Cuimhneacháin Stardust ), also known as the Stardust Memorial Garden, is a protected memorial park located in Coolock, Dublin built to commemorate the lives of those who died in the Stardust nightclub 1981 fire in Artane, Dublin. The park was officially completed and opened on 18 September 1993, by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Tomás MacGiolla. The memorial represents a circular pool with a bronze sculpture of a dancing couple in the middle, and the memorial was designed by the sculptor, Robin Buick. Water is pumped by 48 jets in the illuminated fountain which surrounds the sculpture. The fountain is enclosed by 48 pillars, each pillar representing a person lost in the tragedy. In the memorial park, there is a number of facilities open to the public including a newly renovated playground and a garden terrace. The park comprises 20 acres along the Santry River. The land was originally a 12th-century monastic site.
