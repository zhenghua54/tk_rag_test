Canada's Wonderland is a 330 acre theme park located in Vaughan, Ontario, a suburb approximately 40 km north of Downtown Toronto. Opened in 1981 by the Taft Broadcasting Company and The Great-West Life Assurance Company as the first major theme park in Canada, it remains the country's largest. The park, currently owned by Cedar Fair, has been the most visited seasonal amusement park in North America for several consecutive years. As a seasonal park, Canada's Wonderland is open daily from May to September, with weekend openings in late April, October and early November. With sixteen roller coasters, Canada's Wonderland is ranked third in the world by number of roller coasters, after Six Flags Magic Mountain (19 coasters) and Cedar Point (17 coasters). The 330 acre park includes a 20 acre water park named Splash Works. The park holds Halloween Haunt, a Halloween-themed event, each fall, as well as special events throughout the season.
