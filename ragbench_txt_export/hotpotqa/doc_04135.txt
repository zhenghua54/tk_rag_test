The Honda H engine was Honda's Larger high-performance engine family from the 1990s and early 2000s. It is largely derived from the Honda F engine with which it shares many design features. Like Honda's other 4-cylinder families of the 80s and 90s, It has also enjoyed some success as a racing engine, forming the basis of Honda's Touring car racing engines for many years, and being installed in lightweight chassis (such as the Honda CRX) for use in drag racing. The F20B is technically coded as part of the F-series family of engines; it is basically a destroked version of the H22A. It was developed by Honda to be able to enter into the 2-liter class of international racing.
