Prussian nationalism was the nationalism asserted that Prussians were a nation and promoted the cultural unity of Prussians. Prussian nationalism arose as a result of the state-building by the Hohenzollern dynasty that was initiated with the merger of Brandenburg with East Prussia in the 16th century followed later by the incorporation of West Prussia, Pomerania, Silesia, and large portions of the Rhineland and Westphalia by the 19th century. Prussian nationalism has ceased with Prussia becoming non-existent in post-World War II period.
