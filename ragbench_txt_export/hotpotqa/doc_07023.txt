Pope Francis (Latin: "Franciscus" ; Italian: "Francesco" ; Spanish: "Francisco" ; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio; 17 December 1936) is the 266th and current Pope of the Catholic Church, a title he holds "ex officio" as Bishop of Rome, and sovereign of Vatican City. He chose Francis as his papal name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. Francis is the first Jesuit pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, the first to choose a name not used by a predecessor since Lando in 913 AD, and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III, who reigned in the 8th century.
