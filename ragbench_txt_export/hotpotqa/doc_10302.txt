Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.) (October 23, 1924 â€“ November 4, 2007) was notable as the captain of the battleship USS "New Jersey" during that ship's deployment to the Vietnam War in 1968. Considered by those serving on the "New Jersey" to be a "sailor's captain," Captain Snyder was able to motivate his men through his more relaxed shipboard policies.
