Warriors' Path State Park is a 950 acre (3.84 km²) Tennessee State Park in Colonial Heights, Kingsport, Sullivan County, Tennessee, in the United States. It is named for the Great Indian Warpath that was used by the Iroquois in war raids with the Cherokee and other tribes. The park is located around the Fort Patrick Henry Reservoir and Duck Island on the South Fork Holston River. This land was acquired from the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1952.
