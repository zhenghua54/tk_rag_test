James Carroll (December 20, 1955 â€“ April 27, 2016) was an American-born Canadian actor and radio personality, best known for playing Max Sutton on "Wind at My Back", which aired on CBC Television from 1996 to 2001. Most recently, Carroll found a second career as a community radio host and personality based in Huntsville, Ontario. Carroll initially joined Hunters Bay Radio (CKAR-FM) in 2010 as the host of a local afternoon radio show. However, he soon became involved in the growth of the community station, hosting a Top 20 countdown, a Motown show on Mondays, and a local talent show. Carroll helped Hunters Bay Radio expand from its origins as a small, online station broadcast from a household basement into a full FM radio station with a staff of 60 employees by 2016.
