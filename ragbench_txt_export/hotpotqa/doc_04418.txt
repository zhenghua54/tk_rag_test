Triple Canopy, Inc., is a private security company that provides integrated security, mission support and risk management services to corporate, government and non-profit clients. The firm was founded in May 2003 by veteran U.S. Army Special Forces Soldiers, including former Delta Operators. In June 2014 the firm merged with rival security contracting firm, Academi, formerly Blackwater, thus forming the new company Constellis Group. The new CEO of Constellis Group is the former CEO of Academi, Craig Nixon, and training facilities are to be consolidated at the existing Academi training facility in North Carolina. It was staffed by, among others, a number of former Army Special Operations personnel, Special Forces Soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, MARSOC Critical Skills Operators, other special operations personnel, and a select few law enforcement officers. Over 5,000 employees worked for Triple Canopy at the time of the merger.
