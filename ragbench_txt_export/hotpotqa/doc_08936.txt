"Is My Team Ploughing" is a poem by A. E. Housman, published as number XXVII in his 1896 collection "A Shropshire Lad". It is a conversation between a dead man and his still living friend. Towards the end of the poem it is implied that the friend is now with the girl he left behind when he died. In writing the poem, Housman borrows from the simple style of traditional folk ballads, featuring a question-and-answer format in a conversation.
