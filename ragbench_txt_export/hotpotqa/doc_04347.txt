Songs From The Trees (A Musical Memoir Collection) is singer-songwriter Carly Simon's sixth greatest-hits album. The two-disc set was released on November 20, 2015 as a tie-in to her autobiography, "Boys in the Trees: A Memoir". It contains newly remastered versions of songs from Simon's career, ranging from 1964's "Winkin', Blinkin', and Nod" (as The Simon Sisters), through 1987's "Two Hot Girls (On a Hot Summer Night)." The collection also includes two previously unreleased songs, "Showdown" (originally recorded during the sessions for her 1978 album "Boys in the Trees") and "I Canâ€™t Thank You Enough", a brand new song written with her son Ben Taylor.
