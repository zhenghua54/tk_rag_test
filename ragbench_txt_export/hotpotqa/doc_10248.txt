Alaeddin Pasha was the first Ottoman grand vizier. His father's name was Kemalettin, and thus he was usually called "Hacı Kemalettin oğlu Alaeddin Pasha" or "Alaeddin bin Hacı Kemalletin, "meaning "son of Hacı Kemalettin's." He was probably from the town of Cendere, from where the famous Çandarlı family also originated. He was a fakih (expert in Islamic law). He was appointed as the vizier during the last years of Osman I's reign (probably in 1320). He continued during Orhan's Bey's reign. Since there was only one vizier in the divan during the early years of the Ottoman beylik, his title was not actually grand vizier, but his post was equivalent to the post of the later grand viziers. Because of this, he is known as the first grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire.
