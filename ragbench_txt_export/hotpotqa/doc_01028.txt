The Black Movie Awards (BMAs) is an annual ceremony held to recognize achievements of film actors of African descent and to honor films that stand out in their portrayal of Black experience. Founded in 1997, with an inaugural event at the American Black Film Festival (ABFF), it has been televised several times since 2005, including the 2005 ceremony hosted by Cedric the Entertainer and the 2006 ceremony hosted by Tyler Perry.
