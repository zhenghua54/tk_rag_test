The Casa de los Jesuitas is a large building located in Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia. The first Jesuit House in Cartagena, home of the College of the Company in 1604, was located in the old Plaza del Muelle, now it is located on Calle de la Ronda street, and serves as headquarters for the Naval Museum. When the section of the Walls that closed the city to the southwest was built, a part of it occupied the ground of the Jesuit College, reason why the governor don Francisco de Murga authorized to the Company of Jesus to raise their house on the Wall, not without it triggering a heated debate. Years later, the governor don Melchor Aguilera obtained a royal cedula that ordered the demolition of the House of the Company of Jesus, to which opposed the disciples of Loyola, being instituted a long litigation, whose solution entrusted the King to the governor of Cartagena de Indias , Don Luis Fernández de Córdoba.
