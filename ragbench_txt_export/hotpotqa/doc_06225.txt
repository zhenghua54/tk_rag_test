Kevin Patrick Smith (born August 2, 1970) is an American filmmaker, actor, comic book writer, author, and podcaster. He came to prominence with the low-budget comedy film "Clerks" (1994), which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and acted in as the character Silent Bob of stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob. Jay and Silent Bob have appeared in Smith's follow-up films "Mallrats", "Chasing Amy", "Dogma", and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" which were set primarily in his home state of New Jersey. While not strictly sequential, the films frequently featured crossover plot elements, character references, and a shared canon described by fans as the "View Askewniverse", named after his production company View Askew Productions, which he co-founded with Scott Mosier.
