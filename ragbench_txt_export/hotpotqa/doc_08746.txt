"Lollipop (Candyman)" is a song recorded by Danish dance-pop group Aqua. It was released as the fourth overall single from their debut album "Aquarium" as the follow-up to their most successful song "Barbie Girl" in Australasia, North America and Mainland Europe (it was not released in the United Kingdom.) Although it said to be one of the group's favorite songs, "Lollipop (Candyman)" failed to replicate the success of "Barbie Girl", "Doctor Jones" and "My Oh My" where it was released.
