The Republic of Malta has one sister city: Bainbridge Island, Washington, United States. In addition, a number of individual cities, towns and villages in Malta have sister cities abroad. In most cases, the association, especially when formalised by local government, is known as "town twinning" (though other terms, such as "partner towns" or "sister cities" are sometimes used instead), and while most of the places included are towns, the list also comprises villages, cities, districts, counties, etc. with similar links.
