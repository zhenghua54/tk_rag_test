The Heckscher State Parkway (formerly known as the Heckscher Spur) is an 8.24 mi parkway on Long Island, New York, in the United States. The parkway, located entirely within the Suffolk County town of Islip, begins at the south end of the Sagtikos State Parkway in West Islip, from where it continues west as the Southern State Parkway. It proceeds east as a six-lane parkway through Brentwood and Central Islip, loosely paralleling New York State Route 27 (NY 27). At Islip Terrace, the Heckscher Parkway turns southward, crossing NY 27 before ending at the toll barrier for Heckscher State Park in Great River. The parkway comprises the eastern portion of New York State Route 908M (NY 908M), an unsigned reference route, with the Southern State Parkway occupying the western section. In order to avoid confusion, the highway is signed as an extension of the Southern State Parkway west of the NY 27 interchange (exit 44).
