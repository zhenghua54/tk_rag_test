The New Rochelle Walk of Fame was installed in 2011 in Ruby Dee Park at Library Green, located in the downtown section of the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. The "walk" is a tribute to some of New Rochelle's most notable residents from throughout its 325-year history. It was created and funded by former resident Roderick Kennedy, Jr., working in partnership with the City of New Rochelle and the New Rochelle Business Improvement District.
