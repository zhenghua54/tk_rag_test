Wedding () is an 18-episode South Korean television drama that aired on KBS2 in 2005. The series explores the relationship of a newly wed couple, showing how two people, who met and married through an arranged matchmaking, slowly develop a relationship and learn what it means to be married. Some of the issues explored include what is the most important thing in a marriage, trust and honesty between a couple, how past relationships affect present, and the role of family in a relationship. Unlike other dramas written by Oh Soo-yeon, which focused on people falling in love by fate or destiny, this one is about two people with very different personalities, values, and backgrounds, and seeing how they learn to love one another despite all of their differences.
