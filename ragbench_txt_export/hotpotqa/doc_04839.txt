The third primary election of the Citizens' Action Party (PAC, known as "Convención Nacional Ciudadana" or "Citizens' National Convention") was scheduled for July 9, 2017 in order to elect PAC's presidential candidate for the Costa Rican general election, 2018. Albeit rumors about possible candidates included former candidate and deputy Otton Solis, current Vice-President Ana Helena Chacón and former president of Congress and current UN ambassador Juan Carlos Mendoza, all of them denied having aspirations for the moment. Instead the first announcing his intention to be nominated was Minister Carlos Alvarado, former Minister of Social Issues and President of the Joint Social Welfare Institute and latter Minister of Labor under Luis Guillermo Solis' presidency. He was quickly followed by Economy Minister Welmer Ramos, both resigning their offices as the Constitution requires before February 2017. Congresswoman and former pre-candidate Epsy Campbell made her intentions public on March of the same year in what could have been Campbell's third attempt to be presidential nominee. But on March 27 Campbell withdraw from the race.
