In gambling in general and the game of Craps in particular, snake eyes is the outcome of rolling the dice in a game and getting only one pip on each die. The pair of pips resembles a pair of eyes, which is appended to the word "snake" because of the creature's long-standing association with treachery and betrayal. The dictionary of etymology traces use of the term as far back as 1929. Ancient Roman dice games used the term "dogs" to describe a throw of double ones, referring to this as "the dog throw".
