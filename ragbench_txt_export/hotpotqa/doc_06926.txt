The Third Fitzwilliam Meetinghouse is a historic meeting house on the village green in Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire. It presently serves as Fitzwilliam Town Hall. The two story white clapboard structure was built in 1817, replacing the second meetinghouse, which stood on the same site and was destroyed by fire. It is a rectangular structure with a projecting Greek Revival temple front with four columns and a triangular pediment. A four-stage tower rises above the front facade, with a clock (given in 1861) in the first stage, and a Paul Revere bell hangs in the second stage belfry, an open section with round arches on all four sides. The building was converted to entirely secular uses in 1858, at which time the gallery level was converted into a full second story.
