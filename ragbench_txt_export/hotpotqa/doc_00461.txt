Sgt. Petsound's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a track-for-track mash-up of The Beach Boys’ "Pet Sounds" with The Beatles’ "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" by Clayton Counts, posted on his blog. It was released under the pseudonym "The Beachles" and received favorable mentions in "Entertainment Weekly" and "USA Today", as well as blogs around the world. Sometime around September 8, 2006, Counts received a cease and desist order from EMI's attorneys. Notably, the letter included a demand for Counts to hand over the IP addresses of everyone who downloaded or streamed the songs. Counts removed the songs, but refused to give up the IPs and fired back with a lengthy missive on his blog. The incident drew the attention of the Associated Press and "Rolling Stone", and resulted in a letter-writing campaign and a boycott of EMI and Capitol Records on behalf of Mr. Counts.
