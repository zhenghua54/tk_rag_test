"Gorilla" is a song by American recording artist Bruno Mars from his 2012 studio album "Unorthodox Jukebox". The song was written by Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while production was handled by the former along with Emile Haynie, Jeff Bhasker and Mark Ronson, who had all previously co-produced the single "Locked Out of Heaven" for the same album. Atlantic Records serviced the track to Contemporary hit radio in the United States on September 10, 2013, as the fourth single from "Unorthodox Jukebox". The official remix (G-Mix) of the song features American singers Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, and was released in Canada and US on November 12. "Gorilla" is a midtempo rock and soft rock song with a power pop hook, epic guitars and a synth/percussion combination resembling a Phil Collins-esque. Its style has drawn comparisons towards Prince's 1984 single "Purple Rain".
