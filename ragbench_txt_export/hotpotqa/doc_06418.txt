The Sila language, also known as "Dar Sila", Dar Sila Daju, "Bokor, Bokorike, Bokoruge, Dadjo, Dajou, Daju," and "Sula," is an Eastern Sudanic language, one of three closely related languages in the area called "Daju" (the other two being the Nyala language and the Daju Mongo language). It is spoken in Chad near the Darfur border, with migration into Sudan. There are two dialects, Sila proper and Mongo, the latter not to be confused with Daju Mongo.
