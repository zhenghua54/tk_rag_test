Tarkett S.A., known until 2008 as Sommer-Allibert S.A., is a French multinational corporation specialised in the production of floor and wall coverings. Headquartered in La DÃ©fense, near Paris, the present company was formed in October 1997 by the merging of two others: French Sommer-Allibert and German Tarkett AG. These two companies were in turn formed by the combination of various smaller companies in Sweden, Germany and France. The Tarkett name came from a product developed by a Swedish predecessor.
