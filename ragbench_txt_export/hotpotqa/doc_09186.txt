Chromasette was the first cassette-based TRS-80 Color Computer magazine produced by David Lagerquist and was an offshoot of "CLOAD" magazine. The first issue was published July 1981 and the last issue was published in July 1984. Issues were published monthly. While some references cite the price as having been $3.50 USD an issue, it was advertised in Creative Computing magazine in May 1983 as $45 USD a year for 12 issues, $25 USD for 6 issues, or $5 USD each. The first issue contained 5 Basic programs and the "cover" of the electronic magazine (which had to be loaded onto a TRS-80 Color Computer and then run) was dynamic. Included with each cassette was a 5-6 page newsletter explaining the programs included on the cassette, including their PMODE and PCLEAR values (if needed), their locations on tape, and several paragraphs of documentation about each (sometimes suggesting program alterations that change or improve the results). The newsletter contained tips, rumors (for example whether the TRS-80 Color Computer would soon support 5" floppy diskette drives in addition to cassettes for loading and recording software programs), along with other insights. They contained a variety of information about the Color Computer and some of the hardware and software available for it. In addition, they included advertisements. Dave signed only his first name to the "CLOAD" and "Chromasette" letters.
