Lucifer the Lightbearer was an individualist anarchist journal published by Moses Harman in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally produced by a local branch of the National Liberal League as the "Valley Falls Liberal" (1880â€“1883), Harman changed the title after he assumed sole editorship in 1883.
