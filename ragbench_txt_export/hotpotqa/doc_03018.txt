The Plaza, formerly known as Evergreen Plaza, is noted historically as the first modern America mall and set the standard for American mall development until the 1980s. The Evergreen Plaza located in Evergreen Park, Illinois, (a close suburb of Chicago), was planned in the 1920s. It was legally organized by Arthur Rubloff, who is also credited with coining the phrase "Magnificent Mile" describing the upscale section of Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River to Oak Street. Rubloff secured the funding for the Evergreen Plaza from the Walgreen family who lived nearby in Beverly, Chicago. The Evergreen Plaza operated from 1952 to 2013. It featured over 120 stores, as well as a food court.
