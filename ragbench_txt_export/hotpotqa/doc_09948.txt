Google Play Newsstand is a news aggregator and digital newsstand service operated by Google. Launched in November 2013 through the merger of Google Play Magazines and Google Currents, the service lets users subscribe to magazines (in select countries) and topical news feeds, receiving new issues and updates automatically. Content can be read on a dedicated Newsstand section of the Google Play website or through the mobile apps for Android and iOS. Offline download and reading is supported on the mobile apps.
