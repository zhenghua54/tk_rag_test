"Homecoming" is a song by American hip-hop recording artist and record producer Kanye West. It was included as the twelfth song on the track-listing of his third studio album "Graduation" (2007). The track was produced by West with Warryn Campbell and features a guest appearance from Chris Martin, lead vocalist of the English alternative rock band Coldplay, who sings the song's chorus. West met Chris Martin by chance at the famed Abbey Road Studios in London, England on February 14, 2006. Afterwards, the two artists held an impromptu jam session and recorded the track. "Homecoming" is actually a reworking of a track known as "Home (Windy)" that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001. The early recordings of "Home (Windy)" exhibit West's once trademark soulful vocal sample production style. Additionally, the lyrics of the song's chorus are different than that of Martin's and were originally sung by singer John Legend, who was known at the time as John Stephens. West wrote "Homecoming" as a tribute dedicated to his hometown of Chicago, Illinois. His conceptual lyrics feature an extended metaphor where he uses a love interest to speak on his relationship with the city.
