The London Festival Orchestra (LFO) was established in the 1950s as the 'house orchestra' for Decca Records. In 1980 it was incorporated as an independent performing orchestra under Ross Pople. At least in the world of pop music, the orchestra is best known for providing accompaniment to the Moody Blues for their landmark 1967 album "Days of Future Passed".
