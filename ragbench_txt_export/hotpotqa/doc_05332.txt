The Blessed and the Damned is a double CD best of compilation album by the American heavy metal band Iced Earth. The CD-booklet can be reversed, to show either angels or demons on the cover. The booklet also includes Jon Schaffer's comments on previous albums and his life. Even though the CD was released after "The Glorious Burden", the biography in the booklet makes no mention of it. This is probably because Iced Earth left their record label Century Media Records prior to "The Glorious Burden", and signed with SPV. In turn, Century Media released this compilation album.
