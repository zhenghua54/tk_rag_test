MFS (Masterminded For Success) was an independent electronic dance music label from Berlin, Germany lasting from 1990â€“2008 (although it has officially never actually folded, it has just stopped releasing music). The label was founded by ""Deutsche Schallplatten Berlin"" the former GDR record company, which made it the very first independent dance music label of East Germany, until the DSB closed down in 1993. After which, Mark Reeder and Torsten Jurk took MFS and carried on, to launch the careers, and release music, by some of electronic dance music's seminal artists.
