Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus "Vanilla", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla ("V. planifolia"). The word "vanilla", derived from "vainilla" , the diminutive of the Spanish word "vaina" ("vaina" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as "little pod". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called "tlilxochitl" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.
