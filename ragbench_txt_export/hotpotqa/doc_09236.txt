The Space Opera Renaissance is an anthology of short science fiction that fits the definition of space opera: adventure stories of grand vision, where the majority of the action happens somewhere other than Earth. Meant to be an overview from the pulp fiction era to modern times, it is chronologically-organized and very thick (944 pages) but lacks representation by noted pioneers of the genre such as E. E. "Doc" Smith, Jack Vance and Alfred Bester, focusing more on the next wave. It was edited by David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer. A hardcover edition was published by Tor Books in July 2006 and a trade paperback edition in July 2007.
