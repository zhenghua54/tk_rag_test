The 1995–96 NBA season was the Hawks' 47th season in the National Basketball Association, and 28th season in Atlanta. During the offseason, the Hawks re-acquired Spud Webb from the Sacramento Kings. The Hawks played above .500 during the first month of the season, but then struggled losing 10 of their 14 games in December before posting a ten-game winning streak in January. At midseason, Webb was traded along with Andrew Lang to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Christian Laettner and Sean Rooks. The Hawks finished fourth in the Central Division with a 46–36 record. Head coach Lenny Wilkens reached a significant milestone, becoming the first NBA coach to reach 1,000 victories. Steve Smith led the Hawks in scoring averaging 18.1 points per game, and Mookie Blaylock finished third in the league with 231 three-point field goals, which was a franchise record for the team.
