Karan Kapoor (born 18 January 1962) is a former Indian film actor and model of British and Indian descent. He is the son of Indian Bollywood International Actor Shashi Kapoor and his India settled (late) British Actress Jennifer Kendal. His paternal grandfather was Prithviraj Kapoor and his paternal uncles are Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor. His elder brother Kunal Kapoor and sister Sanjana Kapoor have also acted in some films but like him they were not very successful. His maternal grandparents, Geoffrey Kendal and Laura Kendal, were actors who toured India and Asia with their theatre group, Shakespeareana, performing Shakespeare and Shaw. The Merchant Ivory film, "Shakespeare Wallah", was loosely based on the family, which starred his father and his aunt, actress Felicity Kendal. Karan later moved towards photography and decided to be a part of this profession though he worked as an actor too.
