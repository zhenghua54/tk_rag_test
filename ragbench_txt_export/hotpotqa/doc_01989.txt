The Angel Levine is a 1970 American film directed by Jan Kadar and based on a short story by Bernard Malamud about an impoverished New York City tailor (played by Zero Mostel) unable to work due to health problems, creating a financial strain since his wife (Ida Kaminska) is seriously ill. The tailor's faith is challenged when a man calling himself Alexander Levine (Harry Belafonte) comes into his life, claiming to be his guardian angel. The angel is concerned that he must make the tailor believe in his mission, or else he will be unable to earn his angelic wings.
