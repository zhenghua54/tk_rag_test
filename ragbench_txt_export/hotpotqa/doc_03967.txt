You Were Never Duckier is an animated cartoon in the "Merrie Melodies" series from 1948. Starring Daffy Duck and Henery Hawk, this cartoon marked the start of a direction change for Daffy Duck, from a "screwball" character, to a greedy, self-centered one (though, according to commentary by Eric Goldberg on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD [fifth volume], this cartoon showed Daffy as being "both" a greedy, self-centered character "and" a screwball one). This cartoon was also the next-to-last Henery Hawk cartoon to "not" be directed by Robert McKimson, and one of only four to be directed by creator Chuck Jones (after "The Squawkin' Hawk", "Flop Goes the Weasel", and followed by "The Scarlet Pumpernickel").
