Loretto High School was a small, Roman Catholic, college-preparatory school for young women in Sacramento, California. Although located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento the school was independent of the diocese. In 2005, Loretto High School celebrated its 50th anniversary. In June 2009, the school closed. Many students transferred to coed Christian Brothers and fellow all-girls St. Francis High School to complete their high school education, while others decided to go to public schools such as Mira Loma High School or El Camino Fundamental High School.
