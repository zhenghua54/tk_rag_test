A hot toddy, also known as hot whiskey in Ireland, is typically a mixed drink made of liquor and water with honey (or, in some recipes, sugar), herbs (such as tea) and spices, and served hot. Hot toddy recipes vary and are traditionally drunk before retiring for the night, or in wet or cold weather. Some believe the drink relieves the symptoms of the cold and fluâ€”in "How to Drink", Victoria Moore describes the drink as "the vitamin C for health, the honey to soothe, the alcohol to numb".
