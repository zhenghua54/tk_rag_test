The Kid's No Good was to have been Barry Gibb's debut solo album following his departure from the Bee Gees in December 1969. There was no official title given to the album at the time. The line "the kid's no good", which the album is commonly titled on several bootleg releases, is also featured in the Bee Gees song "Come Home Johnny Bridie" on the 1973 album "Life in a Tin Can". The album features orchestral arrangements by Bill Shepherd who performed the same role for the Bee Gees from 1965 to 1972 (Robin and Maurice Gibb's solo recordings were done with different arrangers).
