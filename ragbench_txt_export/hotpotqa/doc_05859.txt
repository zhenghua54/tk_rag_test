Za'atar (Arabic: زَعْتَر‎ ‎ , ] ) is a generic name for a family of related Middle Eastern herbs from the genera "Origanum" (oregano), "Calamintha" (basil thyme), "Thymus" (typically "Thymus vulgaris", i.e., thyme), and "Satureja" (savory). The name "za'atar" alone most properly applies to "Origanum syriacum", considered in biblical scholarship to be the hyssop (Hebrew: אזוב‎ ‎ ] ) of the Hebrew Bible. It is also the name for a condiment made from the dried herb(s), mixed with sesame seeds, dried sumac, and often salt, as well as other spices. Used in Levantine cuisine, both the herb and spice mixture are popular throughout the Middle East.
