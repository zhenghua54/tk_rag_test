The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound or Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič, also called the Barak, is a hunting dog breed developed in Bosnia. The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game. The "Bosanski Oštrodlaki Gonič's" name is translated as coarse-haired, broken-haired, and rough-haired (among others), and refers to the texture of the shaggy coat (usually called "broken-haired" or "hard" in English.)
