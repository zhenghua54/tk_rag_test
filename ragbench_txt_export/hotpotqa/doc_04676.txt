"Yeah!" is a song by American singer Usher. He co-wrote the song with Sean Garrett, Patrick J. Que Smith, Robert McDowell, LRoc, Ludacris, Da'Ron, and Lil Jon. It also features guest vocals from Lil Jon and Ludacris, with the former also producing the song as well as incorporating crunk and R&B—which he coined as crunk&B—in the song's production. The song was released as the lead single from Usher's fourth studio album "Confessions" (2004) on January 27, 2004, after Usher was told by Arista Records, his label at the time, to record more tracks for the album.
