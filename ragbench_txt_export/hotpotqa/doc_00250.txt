Husband Edward Kimmel (February 26, 1882 â€“ May 14, 1968), nicknamed "Kim", was an admiral in the United States Navy. At the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet (CINCUS) and the U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT). He was removed from command after the December 1941 attack and reduced from four-star to the two-star rank of rear admiral. He retired from the Navy in early 1942.
