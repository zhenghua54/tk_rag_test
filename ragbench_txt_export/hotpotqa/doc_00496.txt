Blue Moves is the eleventh official album release by Elton John. It was released in October 1976. It was John's second double album (after "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road") and the first to be released by his own label, Rocket Records Ltd. Despite the album's darker tone and a wave of negative reviews, on its release it reached no. 3 on the charts, partly on the strength of the its biggest hit single "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word".
