The Common Pursuit is a play by Simon Gray which follows the lives of six characters who first meet as undergraduates at Cambridge University when they are involved in setting up a literary magazine called "The Common Pursuit". The title is an allusion to F. R. Leavis's 1952 collection of essays "Scrutiny: The Common Pursuit".
