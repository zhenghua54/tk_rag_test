Aleksandrs Antoņenko (born in Riga June 26, 1975) is a Latvian tenor who specializes in dramatic repertoire. He debuted on stage as "Prince" in "Rusalka" in 2009. Since then, he has performed in cities such as Baden-Baden, Berlin, Monte Carlo, and Stockholm. Notable appearances include a 2012 appearance in Tosca, as Cavaradossi, at La Scala. In the same year he was seen as Otello at the Royal Opera House in London. In 2013 he appeared in the role of "Radames" in "Aida" at the Zurich Opera House. He followed that performance by appearing as Manrico in Il Trovatore at the Berlin State Opera. He has also performed in "Turandot" as Calaf at La Scala. In 2013, he appeared in the role of "Ismaele" in Giuseppe Verdi's opera "Nabucco", conducted by Nicola Luisotti at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan as well as the Splendid Palace in Latvia. In 2014 he announced that he will perform at The Orchestra Hall in "Cavalleria rusticana" and "Pagliacci". He will also appear as the title role in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of "Otello", which will open the Met's 2015-2016 season. The production is notable within American opera circles due to the Met's decision to abandon their tradition of blackface for the role of Otello. Other future performances include "Norma" at the Bavarian State Opera, "Otello" at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu and Zürich's Opernhaus, and "Pagliacci" at the Royal Opera House in London.
