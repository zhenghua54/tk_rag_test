Liangkang Kangri (also known as "Liankang Kangri") is a mountain peak in the Himalayas on the border between Bhutan and China, as well as at the southeastern end of territory claimed by both countries. Liangkang Kangri is 7535 m high. To the south, a ridge leads to the 7570 m Gangkhar Puensum 2 km to the south-southeast . Due to the low saddle height of 234 m , Liangkang Kangri is not regarded as an independent mountain. Westward a ridge leads to the 6680 m high Chumhari Kang. The Liangkanggletscher on the northwest flank and the Namsanggletscher on the eastern flank of Liangkang Kangri form the headwaters of the Lhobrak Chhu, a source river of Kuri Chhu. The glacier on the southwest flank belongs to the catchment area of Angde Chhu.
