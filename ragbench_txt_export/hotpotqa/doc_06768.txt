Samayapuram Mariamman Temple is a Hindu temple in Samayapuram near Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, India. The main deity, "Samayapurathal" or "Mariamman", a form of supreme mother goddess Durga or Maha Kali or Aadi Shakthi, is made of sand and clay like many of the traditional Mariamman deities, and hence unlike many other Hindu deities there are no "abhishekams" (sacred washing) conducted to the main deity, but instead the "abishekam" is done to the small stone statue in front of it.
