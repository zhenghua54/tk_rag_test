C'mon, C'mon is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, released on April 8, 2002 in the United Kingdom and April 16, 2002 in the United States. Lead single "Soak Up the Sun" peaked at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Adult Contemporary chart and No. 17 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming one of her biggest hits since "All I Wanna Do". The album was arguably her most pop-influenced to date, a big departure from the folk and experimental influences on her previous release, "The Globe Sessions".
