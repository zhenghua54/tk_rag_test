The North American Tour was a concert tour by American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe. The tour originally only had plans to run through Canada and was described as the band's biggest Canadian tour ever (18 shows) as their previous Canadian tours were up to 5 shows. The opening act for most of the tour was Big Wreck. On May 4, 2013 in Estevan, Saskatchewan, lead guitarist Mick Mars, who already suffers from Ankylosing spondylitis, got knocked down by a fan who was going after lead vocalist Vince Neil, causing the other band members to get upset towards the fan who was tackled to the ground on-stage by security, and even violent in bass guitarist Nikki Sixx's case as he kicked the fan while he was lying on the ground. The band left the stage and announced to the audience that it was uncertain if they would return to finish the concert, but a few moments later they did however come back on-stage and play the remaining songs on their setlist. Eleven dates in the U.S. were later added to the tour.
