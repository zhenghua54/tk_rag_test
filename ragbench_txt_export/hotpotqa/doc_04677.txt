"I Don't Wanna Know" is a song by American R&B artist Mario Winans, featuring a rap by P. Diddy, re-recorded background vocals by Enya and sampling the synthesizer riff from Enya's song "Boadicea". It reached number 1 in the United Kingdom and in Netherlands, and number 2 in the United States, stuck for eight consecutive weeks behind the Usher singles "Yeah" and "Burn", respectively. It remains Winans' only major success to date. As a result of its eight weeks at number 2, "I Don't Wanna Know" stands in joint fifth place for the most weeks at number 2 by a song which did not go to number 1, behind Foreigner's "Waiting for a Girl Like You", Missy Elliott's "Work It", Donna Lewis's "I Love You Always Forever" and Shania Twain's "You're Still the One".
