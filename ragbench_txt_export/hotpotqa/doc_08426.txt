Gerry Shamray is an American comic book artist. He illustrated many issues of "American Splendor", Harvey Pekar's autobiographical comics. In an introduction to a compilation of Pekar's work, R. Crumb stated that Shamray "went all the way, taking hundreds of photos of Pekar, his wife, his apartment, the streets of his neighborhood, and so on, and drew from the photos."
