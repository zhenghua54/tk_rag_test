Nicolás Lúcar de la Portilla has been a Peruvian journalist since the 1980s. In 1991 he started his first investigative news program in America Televisión called ""La revista dominical"" roughly translated in English as ""The Sunday report"", it featured almost the same format as used in the long-running CBS News Sunday newsmagazine 60 Minutes. The show at the time was considered one of the most outstanding newsprograms, and it used to be on the top of the ratings during almost all the 1990s. The program lasted until 1999 when low ratings pushed America Televisión executives to mark the end of the show.
