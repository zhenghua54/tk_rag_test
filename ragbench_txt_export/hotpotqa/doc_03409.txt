Al-Qadim is an "Arabian Nights"-themed campaign setting for the "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game. The setting was developed by Jeff Grubb for TSR, Inc., and was first released in 1992. Al-Qadim is set in the land of Zakhara, called the "Land of Fate". Thematically, the land of Zakhara is a blend of the historical Arabian Empire, the stories of legend, and a wealth of Hollywood cinematic history. Zakhara is a peninsula on the continent of Faer√ªn in the world of Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, although Al-Qadim is designed to stand on its own or be added to any existing campaign setting. The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products: "", a sourcebook describing character creation rules, equipment, and spells unique to the setting, and "Al-Qadim: Land of Fate", a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara, with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master.
