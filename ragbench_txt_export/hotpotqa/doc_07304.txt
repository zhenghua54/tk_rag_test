The ClickStart (with the slogan "My First Computer") is an educational computer system created for children aged between 3 and 6 years (toddler to kindergarten) by Leapfrog Enterprises and was introduced in 2007. The entire system consists of a console unit and a wireless keyboard and mouse set. It also uses cartridges simply called "My First Computer Software". The console also introduces Scout, a green-colored dog character who also appears in later LeapFrog products.
