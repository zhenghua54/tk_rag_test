Candlestick Point State Recreation Area (or simply Candlestick Point) is a state park unit of California, USA, providing an urban protected area on San Francisco Bay. The park is located at the southeastern tip of San Francisco immediately south of Hunters Point and 2 mi north of Sierra Point in Brisbane. This 170 acre landfilled area was intended to be used during World War II as a shipyard by the United States Navy. However it was abandoned as the war ended. Without government controls, the area was used by nearby residences as a garbage dump. In 1973 the California State Legislature purchased the land with $10 million and in 1977 voted to turn this area into a state recreation area. After the designation Candlestick became the first urban recreation area in the state. To this day Candlestick remains as a major recreation area in San Francisco, offering a wide view of the bay. The park features various picnic areas, two fishing piers, fitness courses as well as hiking trails. This park is also a popular area for windsurfing because of strong wind.
