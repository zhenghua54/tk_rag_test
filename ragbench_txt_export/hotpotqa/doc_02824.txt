The start of the season was marked by the departure of Ronaldo and the arrival of Hernán Crespo after club had already acquired Fabio Cannavaro, Matias Almeyda and Domenico Morfeo. Crespo, along with Vieri, built an attacking duo. Crespo was essential in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League while Vieri usually scored in the domestic matches. Their partnership worked until Crespo sustained an injury, which sidelined him for several weeks. Without him, despite replaced by Batistuta, Inter lost some key matches. One of these was against Juventus who, could finally aim for the title.
