In the television series, "Miami Vice", firearms took a key role. Episodes such as "Evan" revolved around them, while the characters themselves also used several firearms during the series. Sonny Crockett (played by Don Johnson) was to have used a SIG Sauer P220, but this was replaced by the then more modern Bren Ten. The importance of the firearms in "Miami Vice" is demonstrated by Galco International, which provided the holster used by Don Johnson on the show, naming its holster the "Miami Classic".
