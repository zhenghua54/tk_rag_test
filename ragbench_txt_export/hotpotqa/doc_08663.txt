Gankino horo (Ганкино хоро), “Ganka’s dance”, is a Bulgarian folk dance written in 11 (undecuple) = 2+2+3+2+2 time (typically or ) similar to kopanitsa or krivo horo. The name "gankino" seems to be used mostly in northern Bulgaria (N.W. and north central). The basic gankino horo is a three-measure dance using the step structure also common in the dances: Dunavsko (Danubian Pravo), Povarnoto (also known as Devetorka in Macedonia) and Eleno Mome.
