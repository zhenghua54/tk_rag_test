Descolea is a genus of fungi in the family Bolbitiaceae. Described by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1952, the widespread genus contains about 15 species. It was formerly placed in the family Cortinariaceae because of its basidiospores and its ectomycorrhizal lifestyle. A 2013 molecular phylogenetics study by TÃ³th "et al." found it to be closely related to the genus "Pholiotina" The genus "Pseudodescolea", erected for the single "Descolea"-like species "Pseudodescolea lepiotiformis", was formerly considered distinct until a 1990 study found it to be a synonym of "Descolea antarctica".
