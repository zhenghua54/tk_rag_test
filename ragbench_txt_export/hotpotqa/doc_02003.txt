Como Ama una Mujer (English: "How a Woman Loves") is the fifth studio album and first Spanish album by American singer and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was released on March 23, 2007 by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, "Rebirth" (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est√©fano and Julio Reyes in a period of two and a half years. Composed entirely of ballads (and the exception of a few other genres), "Como Ama una Mujer" talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics.
