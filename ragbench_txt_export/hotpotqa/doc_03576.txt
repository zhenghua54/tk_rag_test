Omeria McDonald Scott (born November 21, 1956) is an American Democratic politician. She is a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from the 80th District, being first elected in 1992. She was also an award winning cheerleader for R.H. Watkins High School in Laurel, MS in the early days of integration. In high school she was a positive force in bridging relationships in the greater community of Laurel, MS at a time when it was especially dangerous to do so, given that the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Devours Nix, lived in Laurel, MS at this time.
