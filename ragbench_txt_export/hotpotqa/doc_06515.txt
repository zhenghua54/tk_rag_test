Old Smokey is a euphemistic name given to the state prison electric chair in New Jersey, which is on display at the New Jersey State Police Museum. The chair's most notorious victim was Richard Hauptmann, the man executed in the chair after being found guilty of abducting and killing Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr. in 1932, the 20-month-old son of famous aviators Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh "(see Lindbergh kidnapping)".
