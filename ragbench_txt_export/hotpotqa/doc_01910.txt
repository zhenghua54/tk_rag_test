Vices is the third full-length album by Christian hard rock band Dead Poetic. The album was released on October 31, 2006 through Tooth & Nail Records. Aaron Sprinkle once again produced the album, and Chino Moreno of Deftones contributed guest vocals to "Paralytic." Lead vocalist Brandon Rike left the band shortly before the album's release and the band's remaining members opted not to continue with the band, although recently it has been stated that the band has not broken up, and will continue writing music.
