Acrassicauda is an American-based Iraqi heavy metal band formed in 2001. It is often credited as being the first heavy metal group to emerge from Iraq. The original band consisted of three Arab members and one Assyrian (Tony Aziz Yaqoo). The band formed and played concerts under the regime of Saddam Hussein. It became well known outside of the local Iraqi metal scene after Vice magazine did a profile of the band. It received even greater coverage when it was profiled in a feature-length documentary about the band and its troubles in Iraq called "Heavy Metal in Baghdad". The band's first album was released on March 9, 2010.
