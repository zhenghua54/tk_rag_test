Machete is a 2010 American action film written, produced, and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquis. This film is an expansion of a fake trailer that was included in Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's 2007 "Grindhouse" double-feature. "Machete" continues the B movie and exploitation style of "Grindhouse", and includes some of the footage. The film stars Danny Trejo in his first lead role as the title character, and co-stars Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Don Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Steven Seagal, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin and Jeff Fahey. This was Steven Seagal's first theatrically released film in eight years since his starring role in 2002's "Half Past Dead". "Machete" was released in the United States by 20th Century Fox and Rodriguez's company, Troublemaker Studios, on September 3, 2010. A sequel, "Machete Kills", was released on October 11, 2013.
