Professor Pac-Man is a quiz arcade game that was produced by Bally Midway and is the seventh title in the "Pac-Man" series of games, which was released in August 1983. Like "Ms. Pac-Man", "Pac-Man Plus", "Baby Pac-Man" and "Jr. Pac-Man", it was created without authorization of Namco, who are the original creators of the "Pac-Man" series. It is also the last of only seven games from Bally Midway Manufacturing to run on their Midway Astrocade hardware.
