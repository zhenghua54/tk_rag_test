James Thomas Knowles (1806–1884) was a British architect with an extensive practice in building upper-class houses in the Italianate manner more familiar in the work of Sir Charles Barry. His designs submitted in the competition for the new Houses of Parliament lost to Barry's design. In London, Knowles built the confident and technically assured palazzo at 15, Kensington Palace Gardens (1854). Together with his son, (Sir) James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908), he was responsible for the Victoria Station Hotel - originally named The Grosvenor and recently rebranded and reopened under this name following an eighteen-month £20m refurbishment.
