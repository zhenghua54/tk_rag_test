Diocirea is a genus of flowering plants in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae. The genus is endemic to a small area in the south-west of Western Australia and is intermediate in character between "Eremophila" and "Myoporum". There are four members of the genus, all of which are small shrubs with stems and leaves which produce a resin making the plants appear bluish-green. Neither the genus, nor any of the species had been described before 2007 although a few specimens had been collected as "Eremophila elachantha". Despite their limited distribution, they often occur in populations of several thousand individual plants, forming a dense ground cover.
