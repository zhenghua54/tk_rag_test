Joanne is the fifth studio album by American singer Lady Gaga. It was released on October 21, 2016, by Streamline and Interscope Records. Gaga collaborated with several producers on the album, including Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, BloodPop and RedOne, and co-produced the majority of the material. The music of "Joanne" features "stripped-down" soft rock and dance-pop styles in order to emphasize the singer's vocal abilities. Lyrically, the album delves on the theme of family and life's emotions, with the death of her aunt, Joanne Stefani Germanotta, having a deep influence on the record.
