Astro Boy (Japanese: 鉄腕アトム , Hepburn: Tetsuwan Atomu , "Mighty Atom", lit. "Iron Arm Atom") is a Japanese television series that premiered on Fuji TV on New Year's Day and is the first popular animated Japanese television series that embodied the aesthetic that later became familiar worldwide as "anime". It originated as a manga of the same name in 1952 by Osamu Tezuka, revered in Japan as the "God of Manga." After enjoying success both in Japan and abroad as the first anime to be broadcast overseas, "Astro Boy" was remade in the 1980s under the same name(s), and in 2003 as "Astro Boy: Mighty Atom". It lasted for four seasons, with a total of 193 episodes, the final episode presented on New Year's Eve 1966. At its height it was watched by 40% of the Japanese population who had access to a TV. In 1964, there was a feature-length animated movie called "Mighty Atom, the Brave in Space" (鉄腕アトム 宇宙の勇者 , Tetsuwan Atomu: Uchū no yūsha ) released in Japan. It was an anthology of three episodes; "The Robot Spaceship", "Last Day on Earth" and "Earth Defense Squadron". The latter two were filmed in color.
