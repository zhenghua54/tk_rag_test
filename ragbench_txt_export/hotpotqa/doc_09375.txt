The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh is the chief executive of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. As per the Constitution of India, the Governor of Andhra Pradesh is the state's "de jure" head, but "de facto" executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.
