The 6.5×55mm (designated as the 6.5×55 Swedish by the SAAMI and 6,5 × 55 SE by the C.I.P.) is a first-generation smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. Other, less common names are 6.5×55mm Swedish Mauser, 6.5×55mm Mauser and 6.5×55mm Krag. It was developed in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice. Norway adopted the Krag–Jørgensen rifle, while Sweden adopted a Mauser rifle design.
