Further, also known as Furthur, is a 1939 International Harvester school bus purchased by author Ken Kesey in 1964 to carry his "Merry Band of Pranksters" cross-country, filming their counterculture adventures as they went. Due to the chaos of the trip and editing difficulties, the footage of their journey was never released as a movie until the 2011 documentary film "Magic Trip" -- although the bus featured prominently in Tom Wolfe's 1968 book "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test".
