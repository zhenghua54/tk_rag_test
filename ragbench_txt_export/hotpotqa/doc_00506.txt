Crown Princess is a "Grand"-class cruise ship owned and operated by Princess Cruises. Her maiden voyage took place on June 14, 2006, departing Red Hook, Brooklyn (New York) for Grand Turk (Turks & Caicos), Ocho Rios (Jamaica), Grand Cayman (Cayman Islands), and Port Canaveral (Florida). As of 2015, the "Crown Princess" sails to Mexico for the Winter season, and Alaska for the Summer season. Like her sister ships "Emerald Princess" and "Ruby Princess" her Skywalkers Night Club is built aft of the funnel rather than suspended over the stern. Her godmother is Martha Stewart.
