Muwashshah (Arabic: موشح‎ ‎ "muwaššaḥ "  literally means "girdled" in Classical Arabic; plural "muwāshshaḥāt " موشحات or "tawāshīḥ " تواشيح ) is the name for both an Arabic poetic form and a secular musical genre. The poetic form consists of a multi-lined strophic verse poem written in classical Arabic, usually consisting of five stanzas, alternating with a refrain with a running rhyme. It was customary to open with one or two lines which matched the second part of the poem in rhyme and meter; in North Africa poets ignore the strict rules of Arabic meter while the poets in the East follow them. The musical genre of the same name uses "muwaššaḥ" texts as lyrics, still in classical Arabic. This tradition can take two forms: the "waṣla" of Aleppo and the Andalusi "nubah" of the western part of the Arab world.
