The Reich Chancellery (German: "Reichskanzlei" ) was the traditional name of the office of the Chancellor of Germany (then called "Reichskanzler") in the period of the German Reich from 1871 to 1945. The Chancellery's seat from 1875 was the former city palace of Prince Antoni Radziwiłł (1775–1833) on Wilhelmstraße in Berlin. Both the palace and a new Reich Chancellery building (completed in early 1939) were seriously damaged during World War II and subsequently demolished.
