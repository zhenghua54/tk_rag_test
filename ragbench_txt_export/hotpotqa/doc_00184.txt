Jeff Martin 777 was a rock band from Perth, Western Australia. The band's name was inspired by Jeff Martin's study of the occult, specifically the work of Aleister Crowley. Martin formed the band with former Sleepy Jackson members Malcolm Clark and Jay Cortez in 2010, after the demise of his previous band The Armada. The band ended in 2012 after the re-activation of Martin's former group The Tea Party in 2011.
