North Shore Square is a 621192 sqft shopping mall in Slidell, Louisiana. The mall is the largest mall on the Northshore of Lake Pontchartrain, fifth largest in the New Orleans area and the 11th largest in Louisiana. The mall is home to two anchor stores, Dillard's, and At Home, as well as approximately 23 other stores. All the anchor stores are on one level. The mall did not flood during Hurricane Katrina and experienced no serious damage. The mall formerly had Mervyns as an anchor store, but closed shortly after the storm when Mervyn's pulled out of the Louisiana market. The store was eventually replaced by Burlington Coat Factory, which is now closed due to corporate downsizing. JCPenney closed on July 31, 2017. The mall has struggled partially due to increased internet-based sales as well as an open-air shopping center located on the opposite side of town, to which it lost some of its tenants. Following a nationwide trend, the mall's future is uncertain as many former mall-based stores have either closed completely or downsized nationally, and enclosed shopping malls across the country are challenged by new consumer trends and shifting paradigms.
