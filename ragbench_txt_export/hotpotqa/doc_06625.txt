Esther Vanhomrigh (known by the pseudonym Vanessa; c. 1688 â€“ 2 June 1723), an Irish woman of Dutch descent, was a longtime lover and correspondent of Jonathan Swift. Swift's letters to her were published after her death. Her fictional name "Vanessa" was created by Swift by taking "Van" from her surname, Vanhomrigh, and adding "Esse", the pet form of her first name, Esther.
