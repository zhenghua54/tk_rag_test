The discography of American alternative rock band The Breeders consists of four studio albums, one live album, three extended plays, ten singles and twelve music videos. Kim Deal, then-bassist of American alternative rock band the Pixies, formed The Breeders as a side-project with Tanya Donelly, guitarist of American alternative rock band Throwing Muses. After recording a demo tape, The Breeders signed to the English independent record label 4AD in 1989. Their debut studio album "Pod" was released in May 1990, but was not commercially successful. After the revival of the Pixies and Throwing Muses in 1990, The Breeders became mostly inactive until the Pixies' breakup in 1993. With a new lineup, The Breeders released their "Safari" EP in 1992, followed by their second studio album "Last Splash" in 1993. "Last Splash" was The Breeders' most successful album; it peaked at number 33 on the United States "Billboard" 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1994. The album spawned the band's most successful single, "Cannonball". The single peaked at number 44 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and at number two on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart.
