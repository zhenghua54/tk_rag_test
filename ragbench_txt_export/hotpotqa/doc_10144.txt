Myosin-1, also known as 'striated muscle myosin heavy chain 1', is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "MYH1" gene. This gene is most highly expressed in fast type IIX/D muscle fibres of vertebrates and encodes a protein found uniquely in striated muscle; it is a class II myosin with a long coiled coil tail that dimerizes and should not be confused with 'Myosin 1' encoded by the MYO1 family of genes ("MYO1A-MYO1H"). Class I MYO1 genes function in many cell types throughout biology and are single-headed membrane-binding myosins that lack a long coiled coil tail.
