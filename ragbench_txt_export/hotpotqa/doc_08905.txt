Eilean Donan (Scottish Gaelic: "Eilean Donnain" ) is a small tidal island where three sea lochs meet, Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh, in the western Highlands of Scotland. A picturesque castle that frequently appears in photographs, film and television dominates the island, which lies about 1 km from the village of Dornie. Since the castle's restoration in the early 20th century, a footbridge has connected the island to the mainland.
