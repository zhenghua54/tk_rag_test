Starr Manning is a fictional character from the daytime drama "One Life to Live". Born onscreen on January 8, 1996, the role was initially portrayed by infant children. In 1998, Starr was rapidly aged when young actress Kristen Alderson debuted in the childhood role, which retconned the character's birth year to 1992. Following the cancellation of "One Life to Live" and its conclusion in 2012, Alderson carried the role over to ABC's last remaining soap opera, "General Hospital", winning a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress for the portrayal in 2013. Alderson is the second "One Life to Live" actor after Gerald Anthony (Marco Dane) to win an Emmy for a crossover role to "General Hospital".
