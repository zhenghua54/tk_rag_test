The Farmall H, produced by International Harvester under the Farmall brand from 1939 to 1953, is a two-plow row crop tractor. It was one of the most widely-produced of International Harvester's "letter series", with approximately 390,000 produced over the 14-year run. The H is equipped with a 4-cylinder engine with a 152 cuin displacement and a 6-volt electrical system. The transmission contains six total gears: five forward and one reverse. It was the smaller of the two prominent row crop tractors produced by IH from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, along with the Farmall M and its variants.
