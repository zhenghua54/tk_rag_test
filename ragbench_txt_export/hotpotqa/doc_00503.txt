Frank Reginald "Freddie" Martin (October 12, 1893 - November 23, 1967) was a West Indian cricketer who played in West Indies' first Test in their inaugural Test tour of England. A left-handed batsman and slow left-arm bowler, Martin played domestic cricket for Jamaica, Kingston, Jamaica being the town of his birth. He played in every Test in both of the West Indies' first two Test tours, in 1928 and in 1930-31. In the fifth Test at Sydney of the 1930-31 tour, he scored 123 not out in the first innings against the strong Australian bowling of the day, part of the West Indies' 350 for 6. Later he took four wickets for 111 runs. This was the West Indies' first victory away from home, and Martin's last Test. He died in Kingston at the age of seventy four.
