Siren Song of the Counter Culture is the third studio album by American rock band Rise Against. Released on August 10, 2004, it was Rise Against's first album on a major record label, after the band signed with Dreamworks Records in September 2003. The recording sessions for the album were split between two studios in British Columbia, with producer Garth Richardson. These sessions were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences, such as the absorption of Dreamworks into Geffen Records, the arrival of a new guitarist, accusations of the band selling out, and the birth of lead vocalist Tim McIlrath's child.
