Calm Before the Storm is the fifth album by Venom. The original title of the album would have been "Deadline", but the title was changed when guitarist Jeffrey "Mantas" Dunn left the band and was replaced by Jimi Clare and Mike Hickey. Both were to follow bassist Conrad "Cronos" Lant in his later solo career and the latter would also return on the 2006 album "Metal Black".
