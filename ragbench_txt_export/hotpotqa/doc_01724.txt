The Phillips Berlina is a neo-classic car built in Pompano Beach, Florida in the early nineteen-eighties. Debuting in 1980, it was designed by Charles W. Phillips in the style of the 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540K Special Roadster. It used stretched C3 Chevrolet Corvette underpinnings, coupled to fibreglass bodywork. As for the Corvette, power steering and brakes, powered tinted windows, and tilt steering were fitted. The fuel injected 5.7 litre V8 engine in the 1982 Berlinas offers 200 hp at 4,200 rpm, for a top speed of around 180 km/h . The earlier carburetted version (L81) had 190 hp on tap. By 1982, a special "Coup√© SE" version was also available.
