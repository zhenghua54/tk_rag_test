Kennedy High School (also known as John F. Kennedy High School) is one of two public high schools located in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA. Named after former president John F. Kennedy, it was opened in 1965 due to the rapid growth of Bloomington at the time. The school had been a member of the Lake Conference since the school opened. The school left the Lake Conference after the 2009-10 school year to become part of the new South Suburban Conference. In 2014, Kennedy joined the new Metro West Conference.
