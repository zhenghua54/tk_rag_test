A referendum on a new constitution was held in Puerto Rico on 3 March 1952. It was approved by 81.9% of voters. This was considered by many US and Puerto Rican politicians an affirmation of the new Constitution of the island as an "Estado Libre Associado", or Commonwealth, as proposed by legislation in 1950 by the US Congress after negotiation with its political leaders. Puerto Rican nationalists question the meaning of the referendum, complaining that the only alternative offered was direct US rule, and no choice of independence was offered. In 1980, the US Supreme Court adjudicated ("Harris v. Rosario") that as a result of this referendum of 1952, the actual Territorial Status was not changed at all.
