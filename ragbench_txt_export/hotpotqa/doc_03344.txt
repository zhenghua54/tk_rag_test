The Lakers–Clippers rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers. The two Pacific Division teams both play their home games at Staples Center in Los Angeles, inspiring their matchups to sometimes be called the "Hallway Series". The Lakers relocated from Minneapolis in 1960, while the Clippers moved from San Diego in 1984. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers. But the Clippers have sold out every home game at Staples Center since Feb. 2011 and entered the 2016–17 season with the sixth-longest active sellout streak in the NBA. The Lakers have won 11 of their 16 NBA championships since moving to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Clippers have made the playoffs only nine times since 1984 and were long considered the laughingstock of the NBA; in the history of the franchise, they have never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. Some contended that the term "rivalry" was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful. For the first time in 20 years, the Clippers won the season series against the Lakers in 2012–13. This was the first of five straight season series victories for the Clippers, which included season sweeps in both 2014-15 and 2015-16. With the Clippers' 3-1 series win in 2016-17, the Lakers have now won the season series just four times in the past 13 seasons, with five Clippers wins, four Lakers wins, and four ties. The Lakers hold a 99–47 advantage in the all-time series against the Clippers. The two teams have never met in the playoffs.
