Hostage Life was a Canadian punk band from Toronto. Formed in 2002, Hostage Life released its first EP, "Sing for the Enemy" on Toronto's independent punk rock label, Underground Operations, home to such bands as Closet Monster and Protest The Hero. The band's second album on the same label, titled Walking Papers, received significant positive criticism from Canadian publications, and the first single, "This Song Was Written By A Committee" achieved widespread radio-play on Toronto's own pre-eminent alternative music radio station, CFNY. Lead singer Colin Lichti was the frontman for Brampton, Ontario band Marylin's Vitamins. Most recently, they played at the SCENE Music Festival in St. Catharines, Ontario (a festival which was host to bands such as Alexisonfire, City And Colour, and The Salads, among others), as well as Toronto's Wakestock 2006, with the likes of Social Code, Boys Night Out, No Use for a Name and Sloan. They played their last show on November 20, 2009 at Sneaky Dee's.
