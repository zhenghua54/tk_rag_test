The Brynderwyn Range or Brynderwyn Hills is a ridge extending east-west across the Northland Peninsula in northern New Zealand some 60 kilometres south of Whangarei, from the southern end of Bream Bay in the east to the Otamatea River (an arm of the Kaipara Harbour) in the west. Though not of great height (reaching only some 450 metres) it is a notable feature of the Northland Region's geography, not least because it is traversed by State Highway 1, which is forced to follow a tortuous route for some distance as it descends to the south. The small settlement of Brynderwyn lies at the southern foot of the hills, at the junction of SH1 and SH12. There are different walks of up to 10Â km giving views of the Whangarei Heads, Bream Bay and out to sea.
