"Electron Blue" is a song by American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was released as the third single from their thirteenth studio album "Around the Sun" on February 28, 2005. Written by group members Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe, the song features a synthesizer-heavy arrangement. Its lyrics describe an electric hallucinogenic drug made of light, a concept which was developed from a recurring dream of Stipe's. Upon release as a single, "Electron Blue" peaked at numbers 43 and 26 on the singles charts of Ireland and the United Kingdom respectively. Michael Stipe performed on the "Around the Sun" tour with a blue band painted across his eyes as a reference to the song, his personal favorite from "Around the Sun".
