Derrick Vincent Thomas (January 1, 1967February 8, 2000), nicknamed D.T., was an American football linebacker and defensive end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He played his entire 11-year career for the Chiefs after being drafted fourth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft. Thomas, a member of the class of 2009 Pro Football Hall of Fame, was a premier football player throughout the 1990s and is considered one of the best pass rushers of all time. In 1990 against the Seattle Seahawks, he set an NFL record with seven sacks in a single game. On February 8, 2000, Thomas died from a massive blood clot that developed in his paralyzed legs and traveled to his lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. His paralysis was the result of severe injuries sustained in a car accident weeks earlier. Thomas was inducted posthumously into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2009
