Trouble (known as Frustration in the UK and Kimble in Finland) is a board game in which players compete to be the first to send four pieces all the way around a board. Pieces are moved according to the roll of a die. "Trouble" was developed by the Kohner Brothers and initially manufactured by Irwin Toy Ltd., later by Milton Bradley (now part of Hasbro). The game was launched in the United States in 1965. It is very similar to the much older game, "Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht", as well as another Hasbro game, "Sorry!" (originally marketed by Parker Brothers). The classic version is now marketed by Winning Moves. All these games are versions of the classic Indian game Pachisi, which was first introduced to the western world in England under the name of "Ludo".
