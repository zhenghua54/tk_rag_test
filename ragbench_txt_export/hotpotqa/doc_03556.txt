The 1987 European Cup Final was a football match held at the Prater Stadium, Vienna, on 27 May 1987, that saw Porto of Portugal defeat Bayern Munich of West Germany 2–1. Both sides were missing key players: the Portuguese were without their injured striker Fernando Gomes, while the Germans were missing their sweeper, and captain, Klaus Augenthaler, who was suspended, along with striker Roland Wohlfarth and midfield player Hans Dorfner, who were both injured. The Portuguese side fought back from 1–0 down to win their first European Cup, with the goals coming from a back heel by Rabah Madjer and a volley from Juary, after a Ludwig Kögl header had given Bayern the lead in the first half. The final was the first European Cup final that Bayern, and their captain Lothar Matthäus would lose to successive late goals, repeated 12 years later in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United.
