David Walker (September 28, 1796August 6, 1830) was an outspoken African-American abolitionist, writer and anti-slavery activist. Though his father was a slave, his mother was free so therefore he was free. In 1829, while living in Boston, Massachusetts, he published "An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World", a call for black unity and self-help in the fight against oppression and injustice.
