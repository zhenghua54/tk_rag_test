The 2014 Texas Revolution season was the team's fifteenth season as a professional indoor football franchise, fifth in the Indoor Football League (IFL), and second as the "Texas Revolution". One of nine teams in the IFL for the 2014 season, the Texas Revolution competed in the United Conference for the second consecutive year. The team played their home games at the Allen Event Center in Allen, Texas. Chris Williams returned to the IFL as the Texas Revolution's director of football operations and head coach for 2014. The team started strong but faltered, compiling a 3â€“11 record and missing the playoffs. In the post-season, Williams resigned and the team announced their departure from the IFL.
