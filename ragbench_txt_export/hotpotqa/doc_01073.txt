Hartmann von Aue (born "c." 1160-70, died "c." 1210-20) was a Middle High German knight and poet. He introduced the courtly romance into German literature and, with Wolfram von Eschenbach ("c." 1170–"c." 1220) and Gottfried von Strassburg (died "c." 1210), was one of the three great epic poets of Middle High German literature. He was also a Minnesänger, and 18 of his songs survive.
