The Midnight Riders is the independent supporters group for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. The name refers to the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. The main aim of the Midnight Riders “is to form a network of supporters such that (they) can meet, watch, travel to, and discuss games, and have a collective voice for supporters' interests with Revolution management.” The Midnight Riders are viewed as “the most passionate Revolution followers”, have been around since the inception of the league, and are known for their use of chants, singing, drums, and banners to show their support for the team and lead others in doing so. The main colors worn amongst The Midnight Riders are dark blue and white (often jerseys of New England Revolution players). The majority of The Midnight Riders sit in the north stand of the stadium (sections 142 and 143) and have a banner hanging across the front of this section identifying it as "The Fort.” In addition to their game time activities The Midnight Riders are responsible for hosting and participating in charitable events, organizing road trips to away games, hosting an annual “Meet the Coach” event, and awarding an annual “Man of the Year” award.
