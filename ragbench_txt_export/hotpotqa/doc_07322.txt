Phospho-Energon, often just called Energon, was a 'miracle medicine' produced and distributed in Sweden. Through the sales of Phospho-Energon, the emerging Swedish pharmaceutical company Pharmacia (founded in 1911 out of the "Elgen" pharmacy in central Stockholm) was able to establish itself on the market. With the incomes generated by the Energon sales Pharmacia was able to initiate pharmaceutical research and the production of other medicines, eventually becoming a major actor in the Swedish and international pharmaceutical sectors. The main ingredients of Energon were calf's brain, sugar and milk. Initially, the drug was sold as a powder to be mixed with liquid, but later pills were produced.
