DC Talk (stylized as dc Talk) is a Christian rap and rock trio. The group was formed at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They released five major studio albums together: "DC Talk" (1989), "Nu Thang" (1990), "Free at Last" (1992), "Jesus Freak" (1995), and "Supernatural" (1998). In 2002, the "Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music" called DC Talk "the most popular overtly Christian act of all time."
