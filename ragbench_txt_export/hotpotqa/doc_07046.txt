The term biblical authority refers to the extent to which commandments and doctrines within the Old and New Testament scriptures are authoritative over human belief and conduct, as well as the extent to which their propositions are accurate in matters of history and science. Biblical authority stems from the fact that God has revealed himself in written form through human authors and that the information contained in the canonical books is not of human origin. It entails, but is not exhausted by, questions raised by biblical inerrancy, biblical infallibility, biblical interpretation, biblical criticism, and Biblical law in Christianity.
