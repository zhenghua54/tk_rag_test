The Cleveland Browns season was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the National Football League (NFL). Although the team improved on its record to 5–11 this 2012 season from its 4–12 finish in 2011, the team still placed fourth in the AFC North. The team also failed to break its 9-year playoff drought, the longest in franchise history. The 2012 season was the third season under the leadership of team president Mike Holmgren and general manager Tom Heckert and the second season under head coach Pat Shurmur. The Browns also had Jimmy Haslam as their new owner, after buying the team from Randy Lerner. The Browns played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.
