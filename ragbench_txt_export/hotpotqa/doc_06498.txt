Greg Douglas is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama "Holby City", played by actor Edward MacLiam. He first appeared in the series ten episode "Together Alone", broadcast on 17 February 2010. Greg was introduced as a new Cardiothoracic surgical registrar working at the hospital's Darwin ward. Producers created an affiliation with long-standing character Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and played a short romance. Greg is characterised as an ambitious, abrasive, rebellious medical professional. He has "Irish charm" and will often use it to his advantage. Greg's fictional backstory detailed him growing up in Dublin, Ireland. MacLiam has said producers wanted a "North Side Dubliner" with a more aggressive persona than other characters to feature in the series. One of the character's initial stories featured him mentoring F2 junior doctor Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). The show developed a "bromance" between the two and they were depicted either arguing or joking their way through scenes.
