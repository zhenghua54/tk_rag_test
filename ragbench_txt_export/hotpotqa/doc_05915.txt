Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 â€“ 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India, but whose attempt during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy. The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader"), first applied in early 1942 to Bose in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the "Indische Legion" and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, was later used throughout India.
