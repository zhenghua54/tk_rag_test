Lieutenant Colonel Donald Field (D. M. Field), CIE, was Chief Minister of the princely state of Jodhpur from 1935 on, and the last of the British Raj leaders of that area. Among the events of Field's ministry was the 1937 order formally granting the request of Mali community of Rajputana to be renamed as "Saini" or "Sainik Kshatriya" in official records.
