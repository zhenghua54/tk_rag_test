Angela Lonsdale (born Angela Smith; 1970), is an English actress. Born to a policeman father, Lonsdale's passion for acting was showcased in the Brewery Youth Theatre at the Brewery Arts Centre, Kendal. Working behind the box office, Lonsdale's talent was nurtured by the then Arts Centre Director, Anne Pierson. She took part in a large number of amateur productions, including plays by local playwrights John Newman-Holden and Tim Bull. After initial rejection, Lonsdale then graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Lonsdale is best known for playing police officer Emma Taylor on "Coronation Street". Taylor married veteran character Curly Watts, played by Kevin Kennedy. After birth of their child, both characters left the programme in 2003. She then took a regular part in the long-running television series "The Bill". Lonsdale appeared as DI Eva Moore in the daytime BBC series "Doctors". She left on 21 October 2008 after being shot and presumed dead by an old criminal acquaintance, but in actual reality left Leatherbridge for her own and Jimmi's safety. She made a brief return to "Doctors" in September 2011. In 2012 and 2013 Lonsdale played the role of the mother in a family of wolves in children's TV drama "Wolfblood". Before they agreed on separation in 2010, Lonsdale was married to actor Perry Fenwick, who plays Billy Mitchell in "EastEnders".
