Matthew Good Band was a Canadian alternative rock band formed by Matthew Good that existed from 1995 to 2002. The band consisted of Good (vocals, guitar), Dave Genn (lead guitar/keyboard), Ian Browne (drums) and Geoff Lloyd (bass) from 1995 to 1999 (replaced by Rich Priske from 1999 to 2001). The band would become one of Canada's most successful rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s, being nominated for 14 Juno Awards and winning the awards for "Best Group" and "Best Rock Album" ("Beautiful Midnight") in 2000. The band dissolved in 2002. Good has since pursued a successful solo career, while Genn joined the Canadian rock group 54-40 in 2005. Geoff Lloyd died in January 2010.
