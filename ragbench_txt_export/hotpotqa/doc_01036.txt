Groote Beer is a 52 foot long (LOD) wooden sailing barge, built in Huizen, the Netherlands during World War II. Rumored to be built for German Air Marshall Hermann Goering. (Actual customer was a German industrialist named Temmler profiting from the war efforts.) The design is based on the shallow draft, leeboard equipped, sailing vessels designed as work boats in the North Sea and capable of carrying goods far inland on the canals of the Netherlands and elsewhere. WWII ended before the boat was completed, awaiting a new customer. In 1947, it was sold to William Greeve, who completed the stunningly ornate construction to match the original design rumors, sailed the boat, and eventually sold it to Charles M. Donnelly (Director of Feadship, Inc.). It was shipped across the Atlantic to the East Coast of the United States to be used to show the talents of Dutch ship builders. During his ownership it was seen in a number of events and ports, but also was involved in a storm incident which damaged a few beach houses and the boat.
