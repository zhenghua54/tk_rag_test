Bořeň (539 m) (also known as Biliner-stein, Borschen), is a phonolite hill two kilometres south of Bílina in northwest Bohemia, Czech Republic. When seen from the northwest side, the hill has the shape of a lying lion. It is a structure similar to the Devils Tower in Wyoming, and is the largest phonolite structure of its kind in Europe. Bořen dominates both the town Bílina and the Czech Central Mountains, with its distinctive silhouette visible from a number of remote locations.
