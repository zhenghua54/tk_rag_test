Turku Coastal Regiment (Finnish: Turun Rannikkorykmentti ) was a Finnish coastal artillery unit operating in the Turku area and Archipelago Sea. It was formed on 10.9.1939 as Turku Sector ("Turun Lohko") as part of the neutrality guard and later Winter War coastal sector system from a peace time "1st Independent Coastal Artillery Battalion" ("1. Erillinen Rannikkotykist√∂patteristo"). Turku Coastal Regiment was disbanded as an independent unit on 30.6.1998 and became part of the newly formed Archipelago Sea Naval Command as "Turku Coastal Artillery Battalion" ("Turun Rannikkopatteristo").
