FC Bayern Munich made few squad changes for the 2008–09 season. With captain Oliver Kahn retiring and coach Ottmar Hitzfeld leaving to coach the Swiss national team, the team leaders had to be replaced. Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed as new coach as announced in December 2007. In August 2008, Klinsmann announced that Mark van Bommel would succeed Kahn as captain. Klinsmann was sacked in April 2009 when the club officials saw the club's minimum aim, qualification for the Champions League, in jeopardy after a string of games in which Bayern underperformed. Jupp Heynckes was appointed as caretaker manager.
