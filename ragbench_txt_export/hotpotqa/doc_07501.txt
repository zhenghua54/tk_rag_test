The Pat Cashman Show was a radio program that aired in Seattle, Washington during the 1990s. Hosted by radio and television personality Pat Cashman, this show provided morning commuters commentary, sketches, parodies of local commercials, and more. The show also featured Seattle radio personality Dori Monson, who would later host his own radio program on KIRO-FM. After the show was cancelled, Pat Cashman's fans made an attempt to bring his show back on another station, which succeeded for a few years, until it was cancelled again.
