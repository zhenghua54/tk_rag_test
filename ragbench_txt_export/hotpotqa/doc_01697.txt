Joe Overstreet (born 1933) is an American painter who lives and works in New York City. In the 1950s and early 1960s he was associated with the Abstract Expressionist movement. During the Civil Rights Movement he became known for works such as "Strange Fruit" and "The New Jemima", which reflected his interest in contemporary social issues and the Black Arts Movement. He also worked with Amiri Baraka as the Art Director for the Black Arts Repertory Theatre and School in Harlem, and in 1974 he co-founded Kenkeleba House, an East Village gallery and studio. In the 1980s he returned to figuration with his "Storyville" paintings, which recall the New Orleans jazz scene of the early 1940s. His work draws on a variety of influences, including his own African-American and Native American heritage, and has been exhibited in galleries around the world.
