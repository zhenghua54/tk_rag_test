Crazy English is a 1999 Chinese documentary directed by Zhang Yuan. The film premiered along with Zhang's "Seventeen Years" at the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival. It established Zhang's position as a "legitimate" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese authorities.
