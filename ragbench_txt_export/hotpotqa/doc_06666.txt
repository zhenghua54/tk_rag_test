The Schlieffen Plan (German: "Schlieffen-Plan" , ] ) was the name given after World War I to the thinking behind the German invasion of France and Belgium on 4 August 1914. Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen, the Chief of the Imperial Army German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, devised a deployment plan for a war-winning offensive, in a one-front war against the French Third Republic from 1905–06. After the war, the German official historians of the "Reichsarchiv" and other writers, described the plan as a blueprint for victory. German historians claimed that the plan had been ruined by "Generaloberst" (Colonel-General) Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, the Commander-in-Chief of the German army after Schlieffen retired in 1906, who was dismissed after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914).
