Wildwood Flower is the last solo album from June Carter Cash. It was released in 2003 on the Dualtone record label, four months after her death and only a few days before the death of Johnny Cash, who provides backing vocals, making this the final release of his lifetime. It was produced by their son, John Carter Cash. The album's opening track, "Keep on the Sunny Side" was a Carter Family anthem that June Carter Cash had previously recorded twice with Johnny Cash: for the 1964 Carter Family album of the same title, and for the 1974 Johnny Cash album "The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me". "The Road to Kaintuck", written by June, had previously been recorded by her husband on several occasions for Columbia Records. The medley of "Church in the Wildwood"/"Lonesome Valley" had been a regular part of Johnny Cash concerts in the 1970s.
