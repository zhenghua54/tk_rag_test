U.S. Vision, a wholly owned subsidiary of Refac Optical Group, is an international optometric dispensary chain. The vast majority of these locations are leased spaces in large department stores, such as J.C. Penney, Boscov's, and The Bay. As of May 8, 2007, 500 locations in 47 states and Canada are in operation, consisting of licensed departments and freestanding stores. In early 2008, due to an acquisition of BJ's Optical Centers located in many BJ's Wholesale Clubs, that number has grown to approximately 650 locations. U.S. Vision deals mainly in prescription eyewear, contact lenses, and optometry offices.
