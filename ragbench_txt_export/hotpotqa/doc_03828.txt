Agranov (Russian: Агранов ; masculine) or Agranova (Агранова ; feminine) is a Russian last name. It derives from the Russian first name Gran (from the Latin word meaning "grain"), which transformed into the last name Granov. That last name transformed into "Agranov", as the latter is easier to pronounce.
