Hoppy Serves a Writ is a 1943 Western film directed by George Archainbaud and starring William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy. The supporting cast features Andy Clyde, Victor Jory and George Reeves. The film remains noteworthy today as one of the earliest performances (his 3rd) of unshaven newcomer Robert Mitchum, who made an impression upon the studio by generating a surprising fan mail response exactly as Clark Gable had after playing an extremely similar unshaven role in "The Painted Desert", a Western starring William Boyd produced a dozen years earlier.
