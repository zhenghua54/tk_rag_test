Cleveland City Hall was built in 1916 at 601 Lakeside Avenue in downtown Cleveland's Civic Center and is where the Cleveland City Council meets. The building was the first of its kind designed by Cleveland architect J. Milton Dyer (who also designed the CAC Building) for governmental purposes for a major U.S. city. At the time of its construction, the Hall was to continue the all important city planning of Daniel Burnham's 1903 Group Plan. The City Hall stands as a historic landmark that was added to the Cleveland Landmarks Commission.
