The e200 core is developed from the MPC5xx family processors, which in turn is derived from the MPC8xx core in the PowerQUICC SoC processors. e200 adheres to the Power ISA v.2.03 as well as the previous "Book E" specification. All e200 core based microprocessors are named in the MPC55xx and MPC56xx/JPC56x scheme, not to be confused with the MPC52xx processors which is based on the PowerPC e300 core.
