Robinsonekspedisjonen: 2009, was the ninth season of the Norwegian version of the Swedish show Expedition Robinson and it premiered on the 6th of September 2009 and aired until the 6th of December 2009. The major twist this season was that of Team X, a team of contestants that had previously been eliminated. The formation of Team X started with a fake elimination of two players in a challenge in episode one. Two more players were fake eliminated in episode one when both tribe leaders were told that they had to choose one member of their tribe to eliminate. In episode 3, Peder was fake eliminated in a duel against Kristoffer. Following the duel Kristoffer swapped tribes. The final two members of Team X joined when in episode 4 Team X competed in a challenge against North team and South team. North team finished last in the challenge and as a result was eliminated, however, Team X was told that they could save one member of the North team from elimination. Team X chose to save Iris, which meant that she then became part of Team X. Severin also became part of Team X as his the North team decided to give him immunity before the challenge. From episode 5 until the merge, South team and Team X competed in challenges against each other. Following the merge, Peder was ejected from the game for faking an injury. As the game progressed, the original South team members began to pick off what was left of Team X until only South team members remained in the game. Like the season that preceded it, this season had a final three instead of a final four. The last three players faced off in two challenges in order to determine the finalists. Ultimately, it was Lina Iversen who won the season over Christian Flotvik with a jury vote of 5-2.
