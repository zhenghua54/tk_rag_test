Polyethylene naphthalate (poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate or PEN) is a polyester with good barrier properties (even better than Polyethylene terephthalate). Because it provides a very good oxygen barrier, it is particularly well-suited for bottling beverages that are susceptible to oxidation, such as beer. It is also used in making high performance sailcloth. It also has been found to show supreme scintillation properties and is expected to replace classic plastic scintillators.
