The Shadowy Third and Other Stories is a 1923 short story collection by Ellen Glasgow. Glasgow published only this one short story collection during her lifetime, which included seven stories. While Glasgow's novels receive more critical attention, scholarship on her stories continues into the twenty-first century.
