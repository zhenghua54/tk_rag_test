Erchinoald (also "Erkinoald" and, in French, "Erchenout") succeeded Aega as the mayor of the palace of Neustria in 641 and succeeded Flaochad in Burgundy in 642 and remained such until his death in 658. According to Fredegar, he was a relative ("consanguineus") of Dagobert I's mother. Chaume cites the "Notitia de Fundatione Monasterii Glanderiensis" to suggest that Erchinoald was son of the Gallo Roman senator Ansbertus, and that Erchinoald's son, Leudesius, was therefore a descendant of the Gallo-Roman families of the Syagrii and Ferr√®oli Erchinoald's relationship with Merovingian King Dagobert has been proposed to have been through his mother Gerberga, daughter of Burgundian "dux" Ricomeres ("fl." 575) and Bertrude, her putative sister, and mother of King Dagobert. Herchenfrida (Erchinfreda), mother of St. Desiderius of Cahors will have also been of this family as is further evidenced "inter alia" by that Gallo-Roman saint's close ties to King Dagobert, and a brother named "Syagrius".
