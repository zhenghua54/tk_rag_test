"Step by Step" is a song written and originally recorded by singer Annie Lennox, later a cross over pop hit by R&B/pop singer Whitney Houston. The song served as the second single from Houston's 1996 soundtrack album, "The Preacher's Wife". Lennox's recording originally appeared as the B-side to her 1992 single "Precious" Largely, Houston's version replaces Lennox's verses with new lyrics and omits portions from the bridge as well. Annie Lennox also provides background vocals in Houston's rendition.
