Drachen Fire was a steel roller coaster located at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, in Williamsburg, Virginia. Operating from 1992 until 1998, the roller coaster was manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. It featured electric-blue track and silver supports, and was located in the Oktoberfest portion of the park, behind the Big Bad Wolf and Das Festhaus. The tagline for the ride was "Feel the Heat." The ride had three separate trains, featuring seven cars each, with each car holding passengers arranged two by two. The cars were red, with grey seats, and featured red trim lights illuminated the trains at night. Upon opening, the ride featured a 150 foot tall lift hill, six inversions, and a zero-gravity camel-back hump element. The ride was shut down in the middle of the 1998 season following a history of low ridership, and complaints of roughness.
