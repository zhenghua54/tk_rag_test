The Twin Towers II (also known as Twin Towers 2, New Twin Towers, Trump Twin Towers and World Trade Center Phoenix ) was a proposed twin-towered supertall skyscraper complex which would have been located at the World Trade Center site in Manhattan, New York City. The proposed complex would have replaced the former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center destroyed in the September 11 attacks, restoring the skyline of the city to its former state. The main design for the proposed complex would feature new landmark twin towers, identical to the originals designed by Minoru Yamasaki, though it would feature 115 storiesâ€”5 floors taller than the originals, among other differences. Beside the towers, an above-ground memorial would have occupied the footprints of the original towers. The new site would also have featured three 12-story buildings, replacing the original 3, 4 and 5 World Trade Center. The complex was designed and developed by American architect Herbert Belton and American engineer Kenneth Gardner, and sponsored by businessman and 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.
