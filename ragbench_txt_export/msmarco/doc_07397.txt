1 Ultra-quiet combination units with a light and/or heater will be on the more expensive end of the spectrum. 2  Installation, including electrical and duct work, can cost as little as $200-$300 for a bathroom near an exterior wall with a horizontal duct installation. 1 If the bathroom is located on the second floor (in a 2 story home) far from an exterior wall, labor costs will be cheaper to go into the attic and up through the roof. 2  The effectiveness of drawing air from the outside with the fan in this case will be much more difficult, however.
