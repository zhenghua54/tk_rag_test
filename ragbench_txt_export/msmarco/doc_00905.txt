The confirmation mail for second account will too be sent to [email protected] Similarly, try for [email protected] or [email protected] In this way you can create a large no. of Facebook accounts with same Gmail address. Personally, I think its easier to just create multiple free email accounts and create FB accounts with those individually. FB doesn’t seem to worry about multiple accounts unless there’s spamming involved. They have no way to prove its the same person or several people using the same computer.
