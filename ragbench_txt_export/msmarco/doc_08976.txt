A common way to calculate hours for a salaried employee is to take the annual salary and divide it by 2080 (total hours worked in a standard year) to determine the employees hourly rate. You can then multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours for which the employee is being paid. Example: John's salary is $30,000. $30,000/2080 = $14.42 hourly rate. John only worked three business days (24 hours) for this pay period. The amount to enter in the Rate column on the paycheck is $14.42 x 24 = $346.08
