Confidence votes 55. Capillary electrophoresis (CE), also known as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), can be used to separate ionic species by their charge and frictional forces. In traditional electrophoresis, electrically charged analytes move in a conductive liquid medium under the influence of an electric field. With DNA capillary electrophoresis, DNA strands are made through DNA replication with dNTPs that are fluorescently labeled for the different nucleotides. Each base is labeled a different color. A fine laser lights up the DNA strand in the capillary tube and reads what color fluoresces.
