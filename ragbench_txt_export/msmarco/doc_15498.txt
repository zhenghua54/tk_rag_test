P. mirabilis is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can be found as part of the micro flora in the human intestine. This organism is not usually a pathogen, but does become a problem when it comes into contact with urea in the urinary tract. From there, infection can spread to other parts of the body. P. mirabilis has a bacillus morphology and is a gram-negative bacterium. It is motile, alternating between vegetative swimmers and hyper-flagellated swarmer cells (Belas, 1996). It also makes a variety of fimbriae.
