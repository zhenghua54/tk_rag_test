Usually, a chemical test is used to first measure the total bilirubin level (unconjugated plus conjugated bilirubin). If the total bilirubin level is increased, the laboratory can use a second chemical test to detect water-soluble forms of bilirubin, called direct bilirubin. The direct bilirubin test provides an estimate of the amount of conjugated bilirubin present. Tests for bilirubin may also be ordered when someone is suspected of having (or known to have) hemolytic anemia as a cause of anemia. In this case, it is often ordered along with other tests used to evaluate hemolysis, such as complete blood count, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, and LDH.
