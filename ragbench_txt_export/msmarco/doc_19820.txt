For other uses, see Precursor (disambiguation) . A protein precursor, also called a pro-protein or pro-peptide, is an inactive protein (or peptide) that can be turned into an active form by posttranslational modification. The name of the precursor for a protein is often prefixed by pro. Examples include proinsulin and proopiomelanocortin. Like other proteins that contain a signal peptide, their name is prefixed by pre. They are thus called pre-pro-proteins or pre-pro-peptides. The signal peptide is cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum. An example is preproinsulin.
