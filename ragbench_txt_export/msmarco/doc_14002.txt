Any of the single-celled or multicellular organisms whose cell contains a distinct, membrane-bound nucleus. Supplement. Organisms such as animals, plants, fungi, and protists are examples of eukaryotes because their cells are organized into compartmentalized structures called organelles, the nucleus in particular. The presence of a distinct nucleus encased within membranes differentiates the eukaryotes from the prokaryotes.
