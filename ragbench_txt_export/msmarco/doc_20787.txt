Pulse Rate: Defined, as the rate at which your heart beats. Your pulse is usually called your heart rate, which is the number of times your heart beats each minute (bpm). Changes in your heart rate or rhythm, a weak pulse, or a hard blood vessel may be caused by heart disease or other problem(s). Pulse rates vary from person to person. The normal pulse rate for humans is usually 60 to 100 beats per minute, however, there are certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia which may alter the normal pulse rate of an individual. Other influencing factors include your age, gender and fitness level.
