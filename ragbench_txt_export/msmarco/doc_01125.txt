Balloon Mortgage Endorsement-When a mortgagee policy of title insurance is to be issued on residential real property insuring a lien that contains a balloon rider, the Company may attach to the mortgagee policy endorsement Form T-39. A Company may issue its Planned Unit Development Endorsement (T-17) to a Mortgagee Policy, if its underwriting requirements are met and if it is paid the premium described in Rate Rule R-11.l. The Company may delete any insuring provision if it does not consider that risk acceptable.
