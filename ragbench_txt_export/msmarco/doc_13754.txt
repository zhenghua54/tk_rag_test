It is not to be confused with code refactoring. Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. Furthermore, the term package has other uses in software. A component is a similar concept, but typically refers to a higher level; a component is a piece of a whole system, while a module is a piece of an individual program.
