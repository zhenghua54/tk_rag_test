Apply 2-3 medium wet coats, or until hiding is achieved, with a 50% overlap allowing each coat to become handslick before the next coat. Apply at a gun distance of 6-8 inches. A cross-coat method (horizontal one coat, vertical the next) can be used for metallic colors to hel p achieve uniform metallic orientation. If further metallic orientation is needed, increase gun distance and /or increase air pressure during finesse coat application. Recommended dry film thickness is 2.0 - 2.5 mils.
