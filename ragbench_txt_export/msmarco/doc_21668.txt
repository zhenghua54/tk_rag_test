1 Adding new floor space for a simple bedroom and closet with a foundation (but no bathroom) costs about $25-$50 a square foot if you do all or most of the work yourself (requires high-level skills), and anywhere from $50-$150 or more a square foot to hire a builder, depending on complexity and local labor rates.
