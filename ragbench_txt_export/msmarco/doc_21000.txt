Place the pan with the salmon into the oven and bake the rest of the way for 6 - 7 minutes. To check the 'doneness' (my word), gently press down on the salmon. If it is mushy feeling, cook it a bit longer. If it is slightly ;springy', it is ready. It is a feel you learn with experience. Best Answer: Salmon is a great fish to pan sear and pop into the oven to continue cooking. Preheat the oven to 400F. Wash fish fillets in cold water and pat dry.
