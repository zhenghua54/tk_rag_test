There are 4 species of Mexican Mole Lizard but all the fame seems to be centred on just one, Bipes biporus, who has five toes, is about 20 cm (8 in) long and less than 1 cm wide. It seems like the other species have just 3 or 4 toes. Mexican Mole Lizards aren't really lizards at all but they are a relation, and so too are snakes. These Ajolotes have a genus to themselves called Bipes, referring to their two legs.
