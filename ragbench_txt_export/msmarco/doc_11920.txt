Cost. In 2002, the cost of installing blocks per square foot was roughly $3, including labor and materials. During the same year, the cost of installing poured concrete was around $6 per square foot, including material and labor. As of 2010, even though the labor cost has remained the same, the material costs have risen by $1. However, these costs change when you remove the labor cost from the two and decide to do it yourself. The concrete block price drops by $1 per square foot, and the poured concrete price drops by $3.
