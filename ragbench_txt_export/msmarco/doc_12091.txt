The capillary electrophoresis is good and widely used due to the following advantage.It is a high resolution non chromatography separation technique.It has low operating cost and small amount of sample is required. The capillary electrophoresis is easy method and can be used for small ions to macromolecules like proteins, peptides, chiral compounds, nucleic acid. The electrophoresis involves the migration of ions and the opposite charged ions are attracted towards to the oppositely charged electrodes.
