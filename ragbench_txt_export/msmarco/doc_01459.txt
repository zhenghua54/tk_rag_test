Best Answer: Electricity costs about 20pence per unit and 1 unit is one Kw. So 2 Kw will cost you 2 units. Electricity is charged by Kw per hour or KwH. so for 2 hours your heater will cost 80 pence. There will be a slight saving on this as the heater will have a thermostat on it and it will cut in and out for a few minutes over an hour. Hope this helps.
