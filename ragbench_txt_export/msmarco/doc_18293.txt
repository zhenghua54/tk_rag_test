It connects the spinal cord with the outside of the thigh, the hamstring muscles in the back of the thighs, and muscles in the lower leg and feet. As such, when the sciatic nerve is impaired, it can lead to muscle weakness and/or numbness or tingling in the leg, ankle, foot, and/or toes. In the lower thigh/above the back of the knee, the sciatic nerve divides into two nerves, the tibial and peroneal nerves, which innervate different parts of the lower leg: 1  Peroneal nerves. 2  Tibial nerves.
