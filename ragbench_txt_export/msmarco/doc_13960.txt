Courts can eliminate potential jurors who are not willing to vote for the death penalty in a capital case. If the judge believes that a juror's feelings about the death penalty would impair his or her ability to judge the case and choose the punishment fairly, that juror will be dismissed for cause.. During the voir dire, jurors in capital cases are questioned about their views regarding capital punishment in order to discover whether they will be able to follow the law in deciding what sentence to impose.
