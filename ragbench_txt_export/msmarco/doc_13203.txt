Vast amounts of land are required to produce biofuels, because biofuels have a very low power density, just 0.3 watts per square meter. 1  For comparison, solar panels have a density of 6 watts per square meter, and an oil well producing 10 barrels of oil each day has a power density of 27 watts per square meter. But because ethanol contains less energy than oil, the actual energy produced by biofuels was the equivalent of 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. Global energy use from all sources, however, is equivalent to 250 million barrels of oil per day.
