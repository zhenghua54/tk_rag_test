In general, the function of the nervous system is to transmit sensory information to the brain for processing and to transmit motor information from the brain for action. The nervous system controls what the organism does; it is in charge. The mind (for those species intelligent enough to have minds) is generated by the nervous system. The nervous system controls our lives and all of our body functions.
