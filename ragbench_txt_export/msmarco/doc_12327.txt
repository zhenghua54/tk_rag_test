No cab. Tonight I see the need for more competition with @Uber // @Uber_Ottawa #ottcity â€” John Baird (@HonJohnBaird) October 5, 2014. As the app-based ridesharing service Uber fights to stay in Ottawa, debate is heating up over whether the company is a technology middle-man or an unlicensed, unregulated taxi service. Uber is cheaper than a comparable cab ride, since it cuts out a lot of the overhead costs that come with running a fully-licensed and regulated taxi service. Many have lauded the service as a low-cost measure to ease city traffic and speed up taxi wait times, while driving down taxi prices.
