Diptheria, Tetanus and Polio would normally be booster doses, which last 10 years. Hepatitis A (as viatim, hepatyrix or havrix mono) gives for protection for up to 1 year. If a booster dose is given 6 months to 1 year after the 1st dose, protection will last 10 years. Hepatitis B vaccination, if given over 6 months, lasts about 5 years. If given in a shorter period (2 months or 3 weeks), cover will only last 1 year and a booster is needed at 1 year for 5 year protection. Meningitis A+C (meningivac) last between 3 and 5 years.
