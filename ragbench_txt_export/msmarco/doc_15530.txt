I am have having mouth ulcers for past 3-4 days, it was okay as they are not so painful but these ulcers are accompanied by red and white patches in my inner cheeks.. and 2 days after the ulcers i got ulcers on my tongue also..and it is really painful, i cant eat neither talk.. I've had an ulcer at the bottom of my gum on the left hand side, its white grey and red, my lip gets rather inflamed and leaves a redish rash kind of thing around it, its so uncomfortable it bares me to eat or drink. I've been using bonjela for 2weeks now and all it does is numbs it for 5seconds.
