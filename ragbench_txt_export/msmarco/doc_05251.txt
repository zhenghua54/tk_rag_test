Characteristics of cognate words [edit]. Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately. For example, consider English starve and Dutch sterven or German sterben (to die); these three words all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, *sterbaną (die). False cognates are words that are commonly thought to be related (have a common origin), but which linguistic examination reveals to be unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb habēre and German haben, both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates.
