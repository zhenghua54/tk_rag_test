The average price to remove a pine tree is around $200 if the tree is 40 feet tall, but the 80-foot pine trees will cost about $1,500 because of the work and potential danger involved. Depending on the breed of pine tree you have, there could be additional work involved with removing the branches and cones. The average cost to remove a palm tree is approximately $150 to $450 to remove if their height is 30 feet. If they're 80 feet tall or more, you might spend $1,100 to $1,500 to have the tree professionally felled. Palm trees have teeth which means they have to be roped down instead of simply cut with chainsaw
