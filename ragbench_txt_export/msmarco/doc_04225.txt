Cost per mille (CPM), also called cost â€° and cost per thousand (CPT) (in Latin mille means thousand), is a commonly used measurement in advertising. Radio, television, newspaper, magazine, out-of-home advertising, and online advertising can be purchased on the basis of showing the ad to one thousand viewers. Note: Notice how the CPM is $6.25 and not $0.00625, this is because we are looking at cost per thousand. 1  In online advertising, if a website sells banner ads for a $20 CPM, that means it costs $20 to show the banner on 1000 page views.
