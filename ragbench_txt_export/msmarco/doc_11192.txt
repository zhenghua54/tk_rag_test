RNA is a nucleic acid consisting long chain of nucleotide units. Like the DNA molecule, every nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, sugar and phosphates. RNA is created by a process known as Transcribing, which involves the following 4 steps: 1  DNA “unzips” as the bonds break. 2  The free nucleotides lead to the RNA pair up with the complementary bases.
