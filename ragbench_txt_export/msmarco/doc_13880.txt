They are energy channels 'transporting' life energy (Chi/Qi) throughout the body. If there are blockages, leading to lack of energy supply to certain areas of the body, or a surplus of energy in other areas... The Body Meridians can be used for Treatment of a condition or/and Diagnosis. Energy blockages can be the result of stress, an injury or trauma, or bad living habits (diet, habits/addictions, lack of exercise) and can be traced to the root of all health (physical/mental/spiritual) problems. Our energy flow affects how we feel, how we think, and the over all condition of our health situation. When the body's life-force energy becomes blocked, various imbalances will result.
