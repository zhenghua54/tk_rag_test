E. CALCULATIONS 1. Calculate the molar concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution using your data for eachtrial. Set up of calculation of M NaOH: (m olar mass of KHP = 204.23 g/mole) # g KHP 1 mole KHP 1 mole NaOH = M NaOH # L soln 204.23 g KHP 1 mole KHP volume of NaOH solution used in the titraion 2.
