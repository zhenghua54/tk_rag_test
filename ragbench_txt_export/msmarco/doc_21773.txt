One way of getting enough vitamin D is through food. Some foods, mainly fish and shellfish, contain vitamin D naturally. Such foods as milk, the major source of vitamin D in food, and most breakfast cereals, contain vitamin D as an additive. These additions, which help prevent rickets (a vitamin D deficiency disease) in children, are synthetic.
