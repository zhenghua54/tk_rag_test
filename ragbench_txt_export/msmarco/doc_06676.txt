Ceviche refers to raw fish marinated in lime, or lemon juice, usually with onions, tomatoes and chillies. The acid in the lime or lemon literally ‘cooks’ the fish, rendering it firmer and more opaque. This dish originates in South America. I have preferred the South American pronunciation because that is the origin of the dish. There is a similar French dish called ‘ escabeche ‘ – escabèche the main difference between an escabeche escabèche and a ceviche is that the fish is fried in, the former before being marinaded, in vinegar vegetables, and spices and. served cold
