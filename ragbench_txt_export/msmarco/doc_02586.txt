We are slowly settling down and looking to get a sense of our budget and spending. We are trying to especially understand how much on average we should budget for utilities. We are thinking $500 a month should be enough to include cell phone, landline, gas, electric, cable/internet, water/sewage/trash. We know some of the bills but not the others which are Austin specific.
