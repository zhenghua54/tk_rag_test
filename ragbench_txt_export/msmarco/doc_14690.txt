MSM, which is a metabolite of DMSO, and approved for use in humans, primarily impacts your health by reducing inflammation. Itâ€™s widely used as a supplement for arthritic conditions.

MSM is already well-known for its joint health benefits, but it may be important for a whole host of other reasons as well. Rod Benjamin is the director of technical development for Bergstrom Nutrition, the largest producer of the highest quality MSM that is produced by distillation purification.
