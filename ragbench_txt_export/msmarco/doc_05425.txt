1 With professional installation a semi-privacy or privacy wooden fence can be $8-$100 or more a foot, depending on material, complexity and location; a basic wood privacy fence typically costs $10-$30 a foot, for $1,000-$3,500 for 100' (depending on whether there's a gate) and $3,000-$10,000 for 300'. Made with wood, with vinyl or screened chain link, a privacy fence is typically 4'-6' tall and solid, designed to block an area from view. Although it's possible to enclose an entire yard with a privacy fence, because of cost it can be more practical to screen a smaller area, like a patio, pool or hot tub.
