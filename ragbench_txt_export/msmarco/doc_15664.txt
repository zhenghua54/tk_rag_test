November 21, 2012 -- Proton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy that uses a beam of protons to eradicate aberrant tissues and cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. The idea behind using proton beam treatments to decimate a tumor is that protons have a larger mass, shorter penetration distance and thus less scatter of radiation than more traditional sources of radiation therapy such as X-rays.
