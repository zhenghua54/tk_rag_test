The process of hot-dip galvanizing results in a metallurgical bond between zinc and steel with a series of distinct iron-zinc alloys. The resulting coated steel can be used in much the same way as uncoated. A typical hot-dip galvanizing line operates as follows: 1  Steel is cleaned using a caustic solution. 2  The caustic cleaning solution is rinsed off. 3  The steel is pickled in an acidic solution to remove mill scale. 4  The pickling solution is rinsed off. 5  A flux, often zinc ammonium chloride is applied to the steel to inhibit oxidation of the cleaned 6  ... The One common use is in metal pails. Galvanised steel is also used in most heating and co oling duct systems in buildings. Individual metal articles, such as steel girders or wrought iron gates, can be hot-dip galvanized by a process called batch galvanizing.
