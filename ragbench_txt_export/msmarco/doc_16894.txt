Schizophrenia symptoms most commonly manifest themselves between the ages of 16 and 30. It is rare for individuals who cannot drive (under age 16) and those 45 or older to show signs of the disease. And itâ€™s important to note that symptoms in men tend to appear earlier than in women. The more well-known symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, typically start when a man is around 16 to 19 years old or in his early 20s. A woman with schizophrenia more typically experiences hallucinations or delusions when she is in her mid-20s or early 30s.
