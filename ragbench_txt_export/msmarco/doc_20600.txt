Biogas can be made at home or at a business from food waste, yard and grass trimmings, and some organic solid wastes. However, efficient use of biogas is more readily accomplished at larger scales. A typical home might cook for an hour per day on biogas from home waste sources. Biogas is principally a mixture of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) along with other trace gases. Biogas can be collected from landfills, covered lagoons, or enclosed tanks called anaerobic digesters.
