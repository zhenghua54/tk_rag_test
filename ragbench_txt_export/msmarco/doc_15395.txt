Previously, we talked about ways to transform a ballroom from a meeting space to a wedding ballroom one of the ways we discussed is using fabric draping. It can really change the feel of a room– giving it a softer, romantic feel and often a “clean slate” in a room where the colors might clash with your wedding colors. Sometimes you can use draping to create a beautiful entry to your wedding or make a feeling of an enclosed space outdoors. Draping can also be used at a wedding to break up a large room into individuals spaces and create a more intimate feel. The draping can be white or colors or white with colored uplighting…the draping can lay straight down or swagged (like the first picture below) and tied with ribbons and/or floral accents. And after this post Dreamy Drapes— Using Fabric Draping at Your Wedding | Venue Safari. I was actually moved enough to leave a leave a responsea response I do have. 2 questions for you if you don’t mind. Is it just me or do a few of these remarks come.
