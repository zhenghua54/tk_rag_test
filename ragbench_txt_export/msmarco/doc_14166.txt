Pauling was born in Portland, Oregon, the first-born child of Herman Henry William Pauling (1876–1910) and Lucy Isabelle Belle Darling (1881–1926). He was named Linus Carl, in honor of Lucy's father, Linus, and Herman's father, Carl. In 1901, after his sister Pauline was born, Pauling's parents decided to move out of Portland, to find more affordable and spacious living quarters than their one-room apartment.
