In geology, subduction is the process that takes place at convergent boundaries by which one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle as the plates converge. Regions where this process occurs are known as subduction zones. Subduction zones dive down into the mantle beneath 55,000 kilometres of convergent plate margins (Lallemand, 1999), almost equal to the cumulative 60,000 kilometres of mid-ocean ridges.
