A tropical rainforest is typically hot year round with little temperature change from month to month. Tropical rainforests are near the equator because the climate there is warm, very wet and constant due to the position of the sun over the equator; it's always directly overhead. The plants that live there thrive in these conditions. There are only two seasons in the tropical rainforests: wet season and dry season. Confidence votes 86. The region around the equator is the tropics (both north and south), so any rainforest around the equator which is in the tropics is a tropical rainforest. A rainforest can exist (and does exist) outside the tropics.
