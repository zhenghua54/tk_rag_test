However, the argument against subsidies in India does not consider that just agricultural and fisheries subsidies form over 40% of the EU budget (see Agricultural subsidy) although in Europe less than 10% of the people compared to India will be affected. The total non-merit subsidies for the year 1994-95 amounted to 10.71% of GDP at market prices, resulting in a combined fiscal deficit of 7.3% for the Centre, States and Union Territories. Therefore, if these subsidies were phased out, the same would have a discernible impact on the fiscal deficit.
