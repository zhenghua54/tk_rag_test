Although amylase, protease and lipase are the three main enzymes your body uses to digest food, many other specialized enzymes also help in the process. Cells that line your intestines make enzymes called maltase, sucrase and lactase, each able to convert a specific type of sugar into glucose. The main source of lipase in your digestive tract is your pancreas, which makes pancreatic lipase that acts in your small intestine. First, bile made in your liver and released into your intestine converts dietary fat into small fatty globules.
