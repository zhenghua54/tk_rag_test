Naming an LLC. Before forming an LLC, the company name must be reserved with the secretary of state or its equivalent. Most states require that the words Limited Liability Company or the abbreviation LLC be included in the name of the company. In some states, Limited Company or LC is the preferred designation. The Limited Liability Company (LLC), a hybrid of the partnership and the corporation, has become a popular legal alternative for business owners.
