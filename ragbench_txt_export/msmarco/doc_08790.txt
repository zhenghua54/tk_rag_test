A sannyasi has to be given initiation into sannyasa order by another sannyasi, who then becomes his sannyasa guru. Sannyasi's are given the title, Swami or Goswami, which means, one who has controlled the senses. A sannyasi is generally considered a sadhu and offered great respect. A sannyasi for the first few years of his sannyasa life will carry a sannyasa danda or staff. According to the type of staff he carries you can tell which line or school of philosophy he hails from. Mayavadi sannyasis carry a single rod, known as an eka danda.
