Genetic engineering is also being used to create BioArt. Some bacteria have been genetically engineered to create black and white photographs. Genetic engineering has also been used to create novelty items such as lavender-colored carnations, blue roses, and glowing fish. If genetic material from the same species or a species that can naturally breed with the host is used the resulting organism is called cisgenic. Genetic engineering can also be used to remove genetic material from the target organism, creating a gene knockout organism.
