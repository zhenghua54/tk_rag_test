Getting your baby used to water early is important from a safety point of view and it's great fun too. Your child won't be co-ordinated enough to learn to swim properly until he is two or three, but you can get him to feel confident and relaxed in the water and make swimming a fun way to exercise for both of you. Introducing your baby to water. 1  Make bath time fun. 2  When you first start going to a public pool, make sure you go off-peak. 3  When you first get in the pool, make sure that your baby's face is close to yours and that you have eye contact, holding him close to you.
