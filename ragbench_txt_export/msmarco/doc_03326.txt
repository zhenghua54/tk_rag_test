1 As a very general estimate, installing gas line costs $20 to $30 per foot. 2  In some areas and circumstances, however, the price could be $75 per foot or more. 3  This price should include the costs of trench digging and all necessary permits, drawings, and inspections. 1 Extending a gas line to accommodate a new appliance might cost $250 to $500. 2  If, however, that same appliance requires a new line running back to the manifold, costs could reach $500 to $1,000 or more.
