Mean male height: 69.3 in. Standard deviation: 2.8. Mean female height: 64 in. Standard deviation: 2.8. Out of 100 million adult females in the US, less than 5 million of them are taller than 68.2 inches, or 5 8.2. Out of 100 million adult males, less than 5 million are shorter than 66 inches, or 5.
