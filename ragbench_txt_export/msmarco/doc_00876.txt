Oceanic crust is mostly basaltic, which is denser, while continental crust is made from mostly basaltic and sedimentary rocks, which are less dense. This difference in density … is why the oceanic crust sinks lower (thus the oceans) and the continental crust rides higher (thus the continents) on the mantle. 1. The Oceanic crust is dense while the Continental crust is relatively lighter. 2. The Oceanic crust consists of Silicon and Magnessium, while the Continental crust has Sil … icon and Alluminium.
