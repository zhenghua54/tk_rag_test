Nearly all diatoms are microscopic-cells range in size from about 2 microns to about 500 microns (0.5 mm), or about the width of a human hair (note that one micron is equal to 10 -6 meter). Diatoms have been placed in the division Bacilliariophyta, which is distinguished by the presence of an inorganic cell wall composed of hydrated silica. There are an estimated 20,000 to 2 million species of diatom on Earth.
