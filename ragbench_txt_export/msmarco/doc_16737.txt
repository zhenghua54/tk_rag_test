When iPhone buttons are available, this way is one of the easiest methods to restore iPhone to factory settings without passcode. Step 1: Press and hold the Home button (at the bottom of iPhone) and the Sleep/Wake button (on top of the iPhone) simultaneously. Step 2: Hold both buttons until the iPhone shuts off and begins to restart. Let it go when you see the Apple logo appear on screen. Youâ€™ve just performed a hard reset.
