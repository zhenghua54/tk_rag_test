Skeletal muscle is an example of muscle tissue, one of the four types of basic tissue. The essential characteristic of muscle tissue is that it shortens or contracts. There are three kinds of muscle tissue, skeletal, cardiac and smooth. Skeletal muscle is the only type of muscle that we can consciously control through our nervous system. This is the reason it is also voluntary. Skeletal muscle cells are also long and cylindrical. For this reason a skeletal muscle cell can also be referred to as a skeletal muscle fiber.
