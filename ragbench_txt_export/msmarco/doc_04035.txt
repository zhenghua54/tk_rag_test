Smell the fruit. According to the California Rare Fruit Growers, the aroma of the guava changes when it is ripe becoming musky, sweet and penetrating, so you should be able to smell it without having to put the fruit up to your nose. 1 Ripe guavas can be stored in the refrigerator for two days. 2  Guavas purchased or picked when green and hard continue to ripen when kept at room temperature. 3  Place green guavas in a paper bag with a banana or apple for faster ripening.
