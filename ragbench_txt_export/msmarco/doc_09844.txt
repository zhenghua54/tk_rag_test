Shooting pain, numbness, and/or tingling down one side of your lower back and into your leg or foot may be an indication you are suffering from irritation to the sciatic nerve. Sciatica is often caused by a problem in the lower back that compresses nerve roots and sends pain signals down the back of the leg. Many different conditions in the spine can irritate the sciatic nerve. The most common causes of sciatica include: 1  Lumbar Herniated Disc. 2  Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD). 3  Isthmic Spondylolisthesis. 4  Lumbar Spinal Stenosis. 5  Piriformis Syndrome. 6  Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction (SI Joint Pain).
