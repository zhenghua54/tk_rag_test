On Facebook, the smaller and more relevant the audience for an ad, the better it performs. For instance, take a look at this ad from Aspen Heights, what I believe is a real estate company: They already have a relevance issue with “Aspen” in the name. This ad was targeted toward me, but I live in NYC. Aspen makes me think of Colorado and skiing. When we think through this process, it makes complete sense. The more relevant an ad is to you specifically, the more likely you are to notice and act on it. And we know most Facebook fans are existing customers or potential customers of a business.
