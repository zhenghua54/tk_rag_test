Depends on how much you're going to cook and make meals yourself, versus buying stuff that's already mostly prepared. If you're going to cook and do all the work yourself, probably $300 per month. If you're buying a lot of prepared stuff probably $500+. I spend $400-500 per month on groceries, give or take.
