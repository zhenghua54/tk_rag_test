However, speaking about Joan of Arc (and other misfortunates afflicted with the gift of clairaudience throughout all time who have had the bad luck to be molested by voices all their lives), itâ€™s my opinion that Joan of Arc was probably not hearing the voice of God or angels or other divine celestial beings.
