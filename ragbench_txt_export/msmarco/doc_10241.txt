If they don't, then they should. $1,000 of extra property taxes each year requires an investment of $50,000 to generate after-inflation interest payments (at say, 2%) to pay for the extra property tax each year. Thus, consider an extra $1,000 in property taxes as equal to a $50,000 increase in the cost of the house.
