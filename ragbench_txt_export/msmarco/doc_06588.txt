Cost accounting describes several different systems of approximating the cost of producing certain products in the manufacturing industry, or completing certain jobs in the service industry. Activity-based costing (ABC) is the most widely adopted and well-known method of cost accounting. A third system, process costing, is used by companies that have consistent production of the exact same product or service. A cost is assigned to processing units. That cost becomes either the input of the next division in the production chain or part of the final product.
