The posterior lobe of the pituitary releases the two hormones it receives from the hypothalamus, called vasopressin and oxytocin, into the bloodstream. Vasopressin plays a role in the fluid balance of the body; oxytocin is thought to pace the onset and progress of labor during childbirth. TRH is produced by the hypothalamus in medial neurons of the  paraventricular  nucleus.[3]  At the beginning, it is synthesized as a 242-amino acid precursor  polypeptide â€¦ that contains 6 copies of the sequence  -Gln-His-Pro-Gly-, flanked by Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg sequences.
