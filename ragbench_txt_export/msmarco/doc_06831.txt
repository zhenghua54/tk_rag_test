Tectonic plates are segments of the Earth's lithosphere, the hard rocky outer shell composed of the crust and the uppermost mantle. This shell is divided by lines of faults, ridges of plate creation, and zones of plate destruction. The Earth's plates are riding on top of the currents caused by these processes. The main features of plate tectonics are: 1  The Earth's surface is covered by a series of crustal plates. 2  The plates are composed of crustal rock and solid upper mantle which is called the lithosphere. * 3  Plates are composed of continental and oceanic crust
