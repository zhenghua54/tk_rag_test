Direct from source: 1. Humans and other apes are descended from a common ancestor whose population split to become two (and more) lineages. The question is rather like asking, If many Americans and Australians are descended from Europeans, why are there still Europeans around?. Apes are still around because humans evolved into humans as we are now and apes evolved into different apes better suited to their environments. thats why there are so many different types of apes, from gorilla to marmasett. jonny Atlantis Â· 9 years ago.
