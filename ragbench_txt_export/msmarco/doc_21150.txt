The jackpot prize amount i.e. the 7/7 prize category for the LOTTO MAX Draw is capped at $50 million. In the situation when the amount of the 7/7 prize category for a draw becomes more than $50 million, the amount that is in excess of $50 million is drawn as a separate $1-million prize called MAXMILLIONS.
