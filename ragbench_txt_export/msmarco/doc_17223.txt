(For example, one phenotype of a pea plant is having purple flowers.) A dihybrid cross is a cross between two individuals that are both heterozygous for two different genes. A hybrid is just the offspring produced when two genetically different parents are crossed. Let's look at an example of a dihybrid cross and see how it can be used to predict the genotype and phenotype chances of offspring. As previously stated, pea plants have two alleles for flower color. Purple color (F) is dominant to white color (f). A second trait of pea plants is height.
