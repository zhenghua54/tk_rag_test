Answer: Goals-Against Average. This is the number of goals allowed per 60 minutes played, rounded to two decimal points. The Formula: multiply the number of goals allowed by 60 and divide by the total number of minutes played. The Example: If you allowed 4 goals in 180 minutes your GAA is 1.33 (4 times 60 = 240. 240 divided by 180 = 1.33). The result suggests that for every full game you play, you allow 1.33 goals. This number expresses a goalie's success based on the number of shots he faces. The Formula: Divide the number saves made by the number of shots on goal. Work it out to 3 decimal places. The Example: If you faced 45 shots and allowed 5 goals, your save percentage is .888 (40 saves divided by 45 shots = .888).
