Proximal Convoluted Tube is-Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries. This is driven by sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na+/K+ ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells. This is the most important transport mechanism in the PCT. The proximal tubule is the portion of the duct system of the nephron leading from Bowman's capsule to the loop of Henle. Structure and appearance The most distinctive characteristic of the proximal tubule is its brush border (or striated border).
