In the broadest sense of the term, all words are symbols. (See also sign .) In a literary sense, says William Harmon, a symbol combines a literal and sensuous quality with an abstract or suggestive aspect (A Handbook to Literature, 2006). In language studies, symbol is sometimes used as another term for logograph. See Examples and Observations below. 1 Although symbolism works by the power of suggestion, a symbol is not the same as a meaning or a moral. 2  A symbol cannot be an abstraction. 3  Rather, a symbol is the thing that points to the abstraction. 4  In Poe's 'The Raven,' death isn't the symbol; the bird is.
