I am a cardiologist who puts in the heart stents. I put in over 200 per year. I work for a group of 4 cardiologist. The cost of a stent is anywhere from 1500.00 to 3000.00. The overall cost do the procedure what the hospital charges is anywhere from 16000.00 to 22000.00. As time goes on insurances allow less money and will not pay if people come back within 30 days.
