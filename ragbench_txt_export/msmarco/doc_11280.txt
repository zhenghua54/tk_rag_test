Best Answer: A metallic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between metal ions and delocalised electrons in a metal lattice In a solid metal the atoms are closely packed together and the electrons in the highest occupied energy level of an atom overlap with those of another atom. not associated to one particular atom and they are free to move through the structure) and the metal atoms become positive ions. Metallic bonds are therefore formed as the positively charged metal ions are attracted to the negatively charged delocalised electrons.
