Hexameter is a metrical line of verses consisting of six feet. It was the standard epic metre in classical Greek and Latin literature, such as in the Iliad, Odyssey and Aeneid. 1 A foot can be made up of two long syllables (– –), a spondee; or a long and two short syllables, a dactyl (– υ υ). 2  The first four feet can contain either one of them. 3  The fifth is almost always a dactyl, and last must be a spondee.
