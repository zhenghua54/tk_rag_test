If you include dividends earned in your option position rate of return, the position earned: ($420 / $5,816 = 7.2%) + 0.9% = 8.1%. Including dividends is a debatable decision. The primary argument against it is that dividends are related to stock ownership and not to covered call writing. For example, you purchase 100 shares of stock for a total price of $5,130. Current value is $5,816. You decide to use the current value of stock as the basis for calculating covered call profits.
