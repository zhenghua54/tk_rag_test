Fuel injection is a system for introducing fuel into internal combustion engines, and into automotive engines, in particular. On diesel engines, fuel injection is a necessity, whilst on petrol engines fuel injection is an alternative to the carburetor. In piston aircraft engines, continuous-flow fuel injection is the most common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system.
