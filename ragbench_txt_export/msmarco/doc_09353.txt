Laws Pertaining to Slavery. Slaves were not considered citizens in antebellum America. Before the fourteenth amendment to the national constitution (July 28, 1868), blacks held no legal rights in this country. Whites controlled politics, and used them to keep slaves and free blacks on a subordinate societal level.
