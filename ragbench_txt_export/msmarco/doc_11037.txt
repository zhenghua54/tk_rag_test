Excitatory Neurotransmitters. The main excitatory neurotransmitters in the body are dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and glutamate. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain. It is very important in the reward system whereby we feel pleasure, achieve heightened arousal and do much of our learning. Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. It plays key roles in cognitive functions like learning and memory. Imbalances in glutamate levels are associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, seizures and forms of autism.
