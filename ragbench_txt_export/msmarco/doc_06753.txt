Many people class rabbits as being in the same ‘order’ or ‘family’ as guinea pigs, mice and voles, thus calling them rodents, but is this true? The answer is no; Rabbits are not rodents (of the order rodentia), as they make up the mammal order ‘Lagomorpha’ along with pikas and hares. Within the order Lagomorpha, rabbits belong to their own family ‘Leporidae’ along with hares.
