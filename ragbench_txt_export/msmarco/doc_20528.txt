Buttons: Buttons, both type and number, have a major impact on the look, and the cost, of chef wear. If you know what buttons you want, you can narrow your selection of chef coats down to show only those items that have exactly what you desire. Sleeve Length: Short sleeves are popular with chefs who want to stay cool in a hot kitchen. Long sleeves are the more traditional option, and three quarter sleeves try to bridge the gap. After narrowing your options and making your choice, you'll go to your coat's product page, where you can choose the color and size.
