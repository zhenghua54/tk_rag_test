In fly fishing, the rod is the rock star. It gets all the attention when you’re bragging about the big one from your last trip. On the other hand, reels are the unsung heroes. They’re the studio musicians to the rock star rods, always ready to back you up when you come calling. Best Saltwater Reel: The Abel Super 9/10N, has a Portuguese cork Stop-a-Sub® drag – which should help you out when you tie into a 150 pound tarpon. Fishing in salt water means you need high performance and rust resistance.
