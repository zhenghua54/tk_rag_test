Number and Length. The number and length of timeouts varies widely among various basketball leagues. For example, high school rules allow for five timeouts for each team during the course of the game. Three of those timeouts are 60 seconds in length, while two are 30 seconds. In college basketball, televised games feature four timeouts per half, to allow for commercial breaks. Each team also receives one 60-second timeout, and four 30-second timeouts, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
