Sealer is what protects your deck from the elements. To keep your deck at its best, it should be resealed every year. Before resealing, clean and pressure wash your deck to remove the old sealer. New sealer costs an average of $20 per gallon, though prices run from $10 to $40 depending on the manufacturer.
