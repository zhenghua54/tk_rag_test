Ad. Silk serge is primarily used as a lining, because it is more fragile than that made from wool. The soft texture of the silk fabric makes it very pleasant when worn against the skin, and the natural flexibility makes it ideal for the often rumpled and highly stressed linings of things like coats and jackets. Many department stores stock serge garments, and it can also be purchased from fabric suppliers for custom work. The origins of serge appear to be quite ancient. The word is derived from the Greek serikos, which means “silken,” suggesting that the fabric was probably brought to Europe from China.
