I love using this edge stitch, especially on a garter stitch shawl or scarf. It makes a lovely neat and clean edge. To make this edge, the first stitch of every row is slipped knitwise (as if to knit) while holding the yarn at the back of the work (wyib). The last stitch of every row is purled. The Truly Triangular Scarf is a simple garter stitch sideways triangular scarf. The increase stitch used is kfb (knit into the front and back of the stitch) which is a great choice for garter stitch as it is nearly invisible.
