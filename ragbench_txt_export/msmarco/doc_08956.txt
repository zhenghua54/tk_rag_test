On average nationally, toilet installation or replacement costs $348, with most homeowners spending between $208 and $492. This data is based on actual project costs as reported by HomeAdvisor members. Installing or replacing a toilet can positively affect your happiness, your finances and the planet. If any of your existing plumbing pipes or lines need to be repaired or modified to fit the new or replacement fixture, it will add to the cost of your project. Also, any water damage to the floor below or around the toilet area will require repairs and further increase installation costs.
