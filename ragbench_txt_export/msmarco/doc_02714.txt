At the same time, in the Southern Hemisphere above the subtropical high, which is located just below the equator, we also find that winds are blowing from the east towards the west. The result is that between 30 ° North latitude and 30 ° South latitude winds usually blow from the east towards the west. Winds are named for the direction from which they come. Thus, this wind is referred to as an easterly wind. These easterly winds are known as the trade winds.
