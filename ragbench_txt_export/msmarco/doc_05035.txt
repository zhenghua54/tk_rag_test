This cycle is known as alternation of generations. The spores of seed plants, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the seeds and pollen grains. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi. 1  Sporangiospores: spores produced by a sporangium in many fungi such as zygomycetes. 2  Zygospores: spores produced by a zygosporangium, characteristic of
