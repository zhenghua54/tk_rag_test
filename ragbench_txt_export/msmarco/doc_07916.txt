Best Answer: I'll try to be as simple as possible.... Step 1 - Helicase unwinds the DNA so that the two strands are separated. Step 2 - Primase adds an RNA primer to each unwound DNA strand. (this is necessary in order for replication) Note that the two strands are different. One strand only needs one primer and then it can be replicated from start to finish.
