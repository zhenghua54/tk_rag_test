Hi Tracy thank you for your post. The information on the government website states: What you need to know It can take 4 to 6 weeks to process your claim. https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance/how-to-claim I hope this is of help to you. It took about 5/6 weeks for me to get a letter back saying i was going to be awarded carers allowance. It said that i would get an award letter this month to tell me how much i'll be getting and then will be paid in May.
