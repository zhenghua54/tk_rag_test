By October 2007, only the United States' government had declared the Janjaweed killings in Darfur to be genocide, since they had killed an estimated 200,000–400,000 civilians over the previous three years. The UN Security Council called for the Janjaweed to be disarmed. The majority of Darfur's Arabs, the Baggara confederation, began their presence in the war over grazing territory, and remain involved. In 1999–2000, faced with threats of insurgencies in Western and Northern Darfur, Khartoum 's security armed the Janjaweed forces.
