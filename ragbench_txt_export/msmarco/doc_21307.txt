Divide the numerator and denominator by the same number. Like multiplication, division can also be used to find a new fraction that's equivalent to your starting fraction. Simply divide the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same number to obtain an equivalent fraction. There is one caveat to this process--the resulting fraction must have whole numbers in both the numerator and denominator to be valid. 1  For instance, let's look at 4/8 again. 1 Converting fractions to equivalent forms is actually a form of multiplying them by 1. 2  In converting 1/2 to 2/4, multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 is the same as multiplying 1/2 by 2/2, which equals 1. 3  If desired, convert mixed numbers to improper fractions to make converting easier.
