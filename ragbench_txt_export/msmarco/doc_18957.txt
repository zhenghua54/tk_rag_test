Add 1 to 2 cups of apple cider vinegar and again, if you have a stubborn yeast infection or a particularly irritating one (whether it is jock itch or a vaginal yeast infection) you may want to add at least 1 -2 teaspoons of water soluble tea tree oil to a bath. Good to sip during or between meals. Apple cider vinegar is a good alkalizer of the digestive tract and is a perfect daily drink throughout the Candida Crusher Program. Some folk claim that apple cider vinegar kills a yeast infection, but this is not my experience.
