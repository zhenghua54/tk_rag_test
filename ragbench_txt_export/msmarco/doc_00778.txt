The anhydrous form of calcium chloride may also be used for this purpose and can provide a measure of the moisture in concrete. Calcium chloride is used in swimming pool water as a pH buffer and to adjust the calcium hardness of the water. CaCl 2(l) â†’ Ca (s) + Cl 2(g). Calcium chloride has a very high enthalpy change of solution. A considerable temperature rise accompanies its dissolution in water. The anhydrous salt is deliquescent; it can accumulate enough water in its crystal lattice to form a solution.
