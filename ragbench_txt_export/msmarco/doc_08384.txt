example. dendrogram(tree) generates a dendrogram plot of the hierarchical binary cluster tree. A dendrogram consists of many U-shaped lines that connect data points in a hierarchical tree. The height of each U represents the distance between the two data points being connected. If there are more than 30 data points, then dendrogram collapses lower branches so that there are 30 leaf nodes. As a result, some leaves in the plot correspond to more than one data point.
