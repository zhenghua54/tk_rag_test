But, when the god Shamash points out that, if it weren't for Shamhat, Enkidu never would have met Gilgamesh, Enkidu's emotions do a 180Â°. Now, he starts blessing Shamhat. This seems to mean that Enkidu accepts his death as the price of his friendship. When we first meet Enkidu, he has just been created by the goddess Aruru, and placed in the wilderness. He is described as being equal to Gilgamesh's stormy heart (1.80), so we know from the start that he possesses some of the same restless, unsettled, rash temperament that Gilgamesh has.
