Best Answer: Mitochondria are sometimes described as cellular power plants, because they generate most of the cell's supply of ATP, used as a source of chemical energy. The number of mitochondria in a cell varies widely by organism and tissue type. Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own independent genomes. According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria are descended from free-living prokaryotes.
