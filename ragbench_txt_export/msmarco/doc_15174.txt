Potassium metal is far too reactive to be found uncombined in nature. The element is quite abundant and makes up about 1.5 % by weight of the earth's crust. Potassium is found extensively as potash (KOH). It is mined in Germany, USA, and elsewhere. Minerals such as sylvite (KCl), carnallite, and langbeinite, are found in ancient lake and sea beds. That as Saskatchewan in Canada contains about 10,000,000,000 tonnes of potassium chloride.
