Best Answer: well, the only membrane bound organelle in a prokaryotic cell is ribosome that too of 70s type. some times they occur in groups called polysomes DNA is not an organelle at all. DNA is NOT a organelle it is just material used to program what the organisms behavior, looks etc. because prokaryotic cells don't have membranes bound organelles, thus no organelles are visible and DNA freely flows about in the organism.
