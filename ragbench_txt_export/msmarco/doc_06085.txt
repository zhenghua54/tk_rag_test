Arthritis is not just a disease of the elderly. According to the Arthritis Foundation, arthritis affects 50 million Americansâ€”two thirds of whom are under 65. Over 100 different kinds of arthritis cause joint pain that can be debilitating. Gout is a form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of urate crystals inside joints. High levels of uric acid in your blood can put you at risk for gout. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , an estimated 64 people in 1000 have gout, and the ratio of men to women is more than 3 to 1.
