E. coli SM10 λpir strain. E. coli SM10 λpir strain contains the pir gene (lysogenized with λpir phage) and it is designed for cloning and propagation of plasmids with R6K origin of replication sequence (such as pUT mini-Tn5 vectors). E. coli DH5α λpir strain contains the pir gene (lysogenized lpir phage lysogen) and is designed for cloning and propagation of plasmids with R6K origin of replication sequence (like pUT
