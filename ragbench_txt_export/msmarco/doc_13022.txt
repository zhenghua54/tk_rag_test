It will cost $300 to $400 per day to hire a general contractor. Many times, a general contractor will also be a carpenter and do a lot of the work that needs to be done. That is a great help and cost savings to the project. Whether a general contractor will do work on a project depends on their skills and the outlook of the job. If your general contractor does not do any labor he may want 10% to 20% of the cost of the project. If he does the carpentry he will want 45% to 65% of the money paid to contractors on the project.
