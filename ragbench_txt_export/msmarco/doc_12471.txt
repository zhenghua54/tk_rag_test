Parrish Name Meaning. English (mainly southern): from the Old French habitational name and personal name Paris (see Paris 1). Parrish is the most common form of the name in English, and is the result of confusion between-s and-sh (compare Norris), reinforced by folk etymological association with the modern English word parish.
