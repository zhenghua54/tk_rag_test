As of 2005 annual store sales in the range of $300 per square foot ($3,000/mÂ²) is considered a respectable result in the United States as the national average for regional malls is $341 per square foot, but the target number depends on the location, the type of store and other factors. One square foot is 0.09290304 square meters. So a sales per unit area of $400 per square foot is (400/0.09290304) = $4305.56 sales per square meter. One acre = 43,560 square feet.
