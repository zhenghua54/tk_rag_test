The West African giraffe is a subspecies of giraffe, distinguished from other types by its light, tan-colored spots. Other giraffes have darker markings. It stands between 16 and 19 ft. tall, and can weigh up to 2,800 lbs. Before World War I, West African Giraffes lived throughout the Sahel and Savanna regions of West Africa. However, due to extreme population decrease, they now inhabit only a small part of Niger.
