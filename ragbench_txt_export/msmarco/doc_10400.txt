Report Abuse. A fetus produces it's own blood. It's blood vessels lie close to the mothers, intertwines with the mother's in the umbilical cord and nutrients from the mother's bloodstream cross over to nourish the fetus, but their blood does not actually intermingle. This is a very odd question, though.
