If you don’t have a stone or tiles then use a flat pan to lay the pizza on top of foil. A pizza shop oven is 650 – 700 degrees but for reheating pizza set the oven to preheat at 450 – 475 degrees and put pizza in oven and leave until oven preheats to set temperature or until you see cheese bubbling. La Befana Pizzeria offers Gourmet pizza for Allston and Brookline neighborhoods of Boston. Reheating pizza in an oven is definitely one of those “ know your own oven .” Times and temperature will vary between ovens and depending on whether you use a pizza stone or unglazed tiles. If you use tiles then keep the stones clean by putting the pizza on a sheet of foil.
