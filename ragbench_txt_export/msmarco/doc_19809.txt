Taxis and shuttles are available directly outside the airport. You can also catch a taxi in the centre of town at a taxi stand, or you can book a taxi over the phone. Throughout winter, there are a number of ski shuttle buses that transfer skiers and snowboarders between Queenstown and the local ski areas. Browse the Queenstown taxi and shuttle operators below.
