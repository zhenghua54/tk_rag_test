**** Rainforests by Michael G. 2001 In an average year the climate in a tropical rain forest is very humid because of all the rainfall. A tropical rainforest gets about 150 cm of rain per year. Many kinds of trees that grow in the mountains of the Amazon rain forest do not grow in the lowlands of that same forest. Layers of the Rainforest There are four very distinct layers of trees in a tropical rain forest. These layers have been identified as the emergent, upper canopy, understory, and forest floor.
