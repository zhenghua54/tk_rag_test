Fees are between 4,500 and some 6,750. Yet since 2012, for the first time, part-time students studying at least 25% of a full-time course have been eligible for tuition fee Student Loan Company loans on exactly the same basis as full-time students. They aren't eligible for maintenance loans or grants though. Both will then be able to apply for a student loan for the remainder of their fees (eg, undergrad med student can apply for a loan for 1-4 years). Graduates on the four-year accelerated medicine programme will have to fund the 3,465 tuition fee for all the years themselves.
