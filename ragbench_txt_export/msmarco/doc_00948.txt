Xylem tissue carries water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. Phloem tissue carries sugar from the leaves to other cells of the plants. Non vascular plants are plants that lack tissues that transport water, nutrients, and sugar. Some example of non vascular plants are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
