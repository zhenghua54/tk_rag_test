The best demo reelâ€¦starts with your name and goes immediately into a scene. Casting agents use the demo reel to identify what qualities the actor has. It needs to be concise and tight.. You don't want to have a drawn-out opening, especially a personalized on-camera introduction. Every actor's reel should contain scenes that clearly identify the actor. There should never be any confusion as to whose reel we are watching. Close-ups are good, as are scenes with people who aren't in your same demographic category. This is where the art of editing a demo reel is really important.
