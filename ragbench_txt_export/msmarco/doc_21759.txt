Vincent is largely used in the Dutch, English, French, and Scandinavian languages, and it is derived from Latin origins. A biblical name, it is derived from the elements 'vincens' meaning winning, conquering; 'vincere' to win, to conquer. Vincentius (Latin) is an old form of Vincent. The meaning of the name has sometimes been associated with the Christian concept of 'winning' or 'conquering' the sins of the world.
