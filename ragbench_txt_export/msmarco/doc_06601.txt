Harnessing the Energy. As the turbines turn they create energy. This happens both as the tide comes in and as the tide goes out. The turbines' energy is then routed to storage generators and sent out through power lines to feed the power needs of the community. Benefits and Setbacks. The benefits of using tidal energy is that it is a natural and predictable source of energy. However, it also has its setbacks since the tide is only moving for 8 to 10 hours per day.
