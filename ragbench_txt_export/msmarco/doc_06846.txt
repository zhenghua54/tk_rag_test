Lamp A will be powered because the redstone signal travels up the glowstone block. Lamp B will be off as the signal would have to go down the glowstone, which is not possible. When placing redstone on a glowstone block, being a transparent block, signals can pass from one block to another diagonally. Redstone wire, even though it may appear to connect up the side of a glowstone block and to the wire portion on top, will not send a redstone signal down the glowstone block. Light source [edit | edit source]. Glowstone blocks emit a light level of 15, the brightest possible light level in the game. They emit the same amount of light as sea lanterns, jack o'lanterns, redstone lamps and beacons.
