Upon arrival in Brussels the first attraction you are shown is definitely the Manneken Pis (little pee man in Flemish). Located close to the Grand Place on rue de lâ€™Etuve 31 (Lievevrouwbroersstraat 31, 1000 Brussels, Belgium) he stands at just 61cm (24 inches). The peeing boy is a tiny bronze fountain statue. In the 80s another statue was built called Jeanneke Pis to give Manneken Pis a playmate. This other statue is a little girl fountain, but she is lesser known and hides in an alleyway a short distance away from Mannekin Pis.
