This cost range does not include fees associated with sedation, X-rays, possible oral surgery necessities, or the proximity of the wisdom tooth to surrounding teeth and nerves. Extraction costs for impacted wisdom teeth are significantly higher than for erupted wisdom teeth. Depending on the type of dental insurance you have, insurance companies may provide a 15 percent reimbursement or up to a 50 percent absorption of the total procedure costs. Wisdom teeth removal is a fairly common oral surgery. However, the removal of wisdom teeth prior to eruption involves a surgical procedure that is far from a simple tooth extraction.
