The goal of the reflow process is to melt the solder and heat the adjoining surfaces, without overheating and damaging the electrical components. The ramp–up rate is usually somewhere between 1.0 °C and 3.0 °C per second, often falling between 2.0 °C and 3.0 °C (4 °F to 5 °F) per second. If the rate exceeds the maximum slope, damage to components from thermal shock or cracking can occur. Solder paste can also have a spattering effect
