Notice John 3:13: “And no man has ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.” Angels are called God’s sons because He created them, not because they were begotten of God, as was Christ, “the firstborn among many brethren” (Rom. 8:29). To understand the origin of angels and God’s purpose for them, the place to start reading is where their first appearance is mentioned in God’s Word. The Bible is like a jigsaw puzzle; the pieces (“here a little, there a little”— Isaiah 28:10) fit together to form a complete picture.
