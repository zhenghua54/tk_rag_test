Best Answer: Yes older dogs can catch the virus...Please read the following...I have also included a bit about cats and the Parvo virus as well Canine Parvovirus is spread by their feces and is most common in young dogs 2 years of age and under. That's not to say older dogs are not able to contract this deadly virus. Report Abuse. Parvo afeects puppies much more frequently than adult dogs. The virus likes to grow in rapidly dividing cells in a puppy's body. The breeds that get it the most are Rottweilers (sadly), bulldogs, dobermans, and boxers. But these breeds are not alone--any breed can get parvo.
