Vitamin D is found primarily in foods to which vitamin D has been added (fortified). This vitamin is critical for bone health. Milk is usually fortified with vitamin D, but other dairy products such as cheese and ice cream generally are not. Such foods as milk, the major source of vitamin D in food, and most breakfast cereals, contain vitamin D as an additive. These additions, which help prevent rickets (a vitamin D deficiency disease) in children, are synthetic.
