Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term trachea) and also higher plants, form a large group of plants that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. 1 In vascular plants, the principal generation phase is the sporophyte, which is usually diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell. 2  Only the germ cells and gametophytes are haploid.
