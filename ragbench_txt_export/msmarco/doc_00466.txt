For one, the orbital velocity of the Earth slows down as it reaches its aphelion. It also has an effect on the climate. … Due to the point in its orbit the Earth climate is made cooler and warmer in the Northern and Summer Hemisphere creating milder or more severe seasons. Closest to the sun. At perihelion, Earth it is 91 million miles (147 million km.) from the Sun. At aphelion, it is 95 million miles (152 million km.) from the Sun. The diffe … rence is only about 4 million miles (5 million km.), which, for all practical purposes, is a perfectly circular orbit.
