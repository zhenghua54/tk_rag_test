In the Dominican Republic, Lent (called cuaresma) is not complete without a sweet bowl of Habichuelas con Dulce Dominican Sweet Cream of Beans. There, pureed red kidney beans are cooked with coconut milk and evaporated milk, sweetened with sugar and spiced with cloves and cinnamon to make a thick, creamy dessert. 1. In large bowl, add beans and enough water to cover beans by 3. Cover; soak 12 hours. Drain beans, reserving soaking liquid. Add enough water to soaking liquid to make 10 cups total; transfer to large, heavy pot set over medium-high heat. Bring water to boil.
