When calling a phone number in another country, there is always a prefix to dial that indicates you are placing an international call; this prefix varies by country. After the international dialling prefix, you dial the international country code for the country you are calling, followed by the local number. In many cases, the international dialing prefix is simply 00. This was set as a standard by the International Telecommunications Union. However, not every country has adopted this method for their own phone prefix system. These countries have special international prefixes.
