Student Loans. Federal and supplemental (private) student loans are available to assist students in meeting their educational expenses. Since loans must be repaid, our office encourages individuals who use this option to (a) fully understand the terms of each loan and (b) take only what is needed. Credit-based. Supplemental loans are credit-based and are not subject to the Federal Need Analysis Methodology. In order to receive a supplemental loan, borrowers must meet specific credit criteria established by the lender.
