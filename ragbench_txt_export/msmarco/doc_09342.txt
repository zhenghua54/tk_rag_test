Six mice can multiply into 60 mice in less than 3 months. One  female can have 5 to 10 litters per year. They have about 10 babies  per litter. Mice are smaller than rats (averaging up to 5 inches in length, including tail) but they live longer and are more common. All of these rodents will eat food and chew on property if they find their way into a home. Severe rodent infestations can result in structural damage.
