You can use an oil primer and still use waterborne finish. Usually 1 coat of primer and 2 coats of the finish is the way to go. As far as brush size and style goes it will depend how much trim, what kind of trim, and how many doors, crown, ect.. For a diyer i would suggest a Purdy 3 XL glide, or a 2-1/2 XL Glide. My house is about 20 years old, with stained wood trim and interior doors. We want to paint it all white. I will be sanding, cleaning, and taping off the trim this week, with the hopes of painting a few rooms worth this weekend.
