To help your child move, have fun and participate, the physiotherapist might: 1  Work with you and your child in his/her environment to develop the child's skills (e.g. arm/leg movements, stretches, walking skills). 2  Support your child with equipment (e.g. walker, shoes, bike, swim floats). Babies and children learn about themselves and their environment through movement. Movement is vital for their physical and mental growth, general health and overall well being. A physiotherapist helps babies and children move to their best of their ability. In order to help the child and family, a physiotherapist: 1  Will spend some time with your child to assess your child's (emerging) skills. 2  Will provide suggestions in discussion with you. 3  Will discuss with you your ongoing concerns on a regular basis
