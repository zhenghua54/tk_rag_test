In order to keep food out of the Danger Zone, your fridge must be set between 32-40° F (0-4 degrees Celsius). Your freezer must be below 32° F (0° Celsius). I keep mine as cold as it will go. Keep your freezer efficient by half-filling it with bottles of water. You're not hugging the danger zone like you would be at 40° F (4.4° C), and you're distancing yourself sufficiently from 32° F (0° C) that you don't freeze half the stuff in your refrigerator.
