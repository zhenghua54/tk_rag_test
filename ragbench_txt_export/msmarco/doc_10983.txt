Instead, the postganglionic axon extends away from the sympathetic trunk ganglion and goes directly to the effector organ. The esophagus, heart, lungs, and thoracic blood vessels typically receive their sympathetic innervation from this pathway. Many visceral effectors have dual innervation, meaning that they are innervated by postganglionic axons from both ANS divisions. The actions of the divisions usually oppose each other, and so they are said to exert antagonistic effects on the same organ.
