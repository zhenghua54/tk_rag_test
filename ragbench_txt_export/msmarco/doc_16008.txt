Spoken word involves performance-based poetry that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and story-telling, that originated from the poetry of African Americans in Harlem. It often includes collaboration and experimentation with other art forms such as music, theater, and dance. Modern North American spoken-word poetry originated from the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance and blues music as well as the 1960s beatniks. Modern-day spoken-word poetry became popular in the underground Black community in the 1960s with The Last Poets.
