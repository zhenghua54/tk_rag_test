The most important treatment for a pulled calf muscle is rest. It sounds simple, but it is vital to rest to allow the muscles to heal and to prevent the injury getting worse. Returning to activity too soon can turn a grade 1 torn calf muscle into a grade 2 or a grade 2 to a grade 3. Other common terms for the condition include a calf muscle strain or torn calf muscle. Essentially, what all these terms refer to is when the calf muscles are pulled beyond their normal elastic limit, overstretching them and damaging some or all of muscle fibres.
