Note. If you file your tax returns electronically, you must keep a paper copy of the return (and supporting records) for seven years. It is important to keep all this information as we routinely audit people's records. For GST you do not need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50, but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount.
