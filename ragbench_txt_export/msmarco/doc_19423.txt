Typically, a move from hourly to salaried work comes with a promotion and additional responsibility. As long as you're up for the extra work, there's no reason not to take the raise. But realize that if you work more than 40 hours in a week (which many salaried workers do), you won't get any extra money. Even if you don't get a promotion, you may get other perks that make the move from hourly to salary worth the trouble.
