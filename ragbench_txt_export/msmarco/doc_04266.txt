Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that forms from the compaction of silt and clay-size mineral particles that we commonly call mud. This composition places shale in a category of sedimentary rocks known as mudstones. Shale is a rock composed mainly of clay-size mineral grains. These tiny grains are usually clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite. Shale usually contain other clay-size mineral particles such as quartz, chert and feldspar.
