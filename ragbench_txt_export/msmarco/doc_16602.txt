Costs vary, but an average range is $150 to $350 a year. Another option is to put aside money in a savings account that is earmarked specifically for your horseâ€™s veterinary emergencies. A bare minimum should be the cost of euthanizing your horse and have his body removed, which averages about $250-$300. In the central Illinois area (again excluding Chicago and suburbs), farrier costs for your horse can range from about $30 (for a trim) to over $100 for a full set of shoes. Most horses need to be shod about every six weeks. This is an very important factor to consider when thinking of buying a horse.
