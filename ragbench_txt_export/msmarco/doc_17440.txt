There are many types of visas that allow you to go to the USA for tourism, business purposes, visiting relatives or friends, studying, working and other purposes. Non-US residents need a valid visa or an entry permit to travel/transit to the US. Travellers from Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries can apply online for an entry permit or visa waiver to travel to the United States for stays of up to 90 days, for a period of up to two years. Visitor visas are split into two categories â€“ B-1 visas are for business travel, B-2 visas are for the purposes of tourism, social or sporting events, competitions, or medical treatment. Also, if you wish to stay in the US and travel for a period of up to six months, then a B-2 Visitor Visa may be right for you.
