April 8, 2011 at 2:31pm. A bird called the megapode living in the Pacific islands prepares an interesting incubation machine for its offspring. During the summer season, the female megapode lays one egg every six days. However, the eggs of the megapode are relatively big compared to its size, being almost as big as an ostrich egg. For this purpose, six months before the spawning season comes, the male megapode starts to dig a hole 5 meters in diameter and 1 meter in depth with its gigantic claws. Then, it fills the hole with wet weed and leaves. The main purpose is to use the heat produced by the bacteria in decaying plants to warm the eggs.
