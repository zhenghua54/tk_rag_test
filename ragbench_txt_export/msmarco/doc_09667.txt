The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by the European aircraft company Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner, and the airports at which it operates have upgraded facilities to accommodate it. The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001, and manufacturing of the first A380 wing box component started on 23 January 2002. The development cost of the A380 had grown to â‚¬11-14 billion when the first aircraft was completed.
