You want the fruit to get the air. Cantaloupes like temps at 70° to 80°F, well-draining compost/soil with a phH of 6 to 6.5, and 1 to 2 inches of water per week, ideally in the morning; about three weeks before harvesting, cut back on watering by half to a third. Fertilize every 2 to 3 weeks with a 5-5-5. Cantaloupe requires 35 to 45 days to mature from flowering, depending on the temperature. Female blossoms have a small swelling or bulb at the base of the flower. Keep in mind that cantaloupe blossoms have a pollination window of one day.
