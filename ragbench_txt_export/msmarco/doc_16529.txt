Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory is a model used, in chemistry, to predict the geometry of individual molecules from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms. The premise of VSEPR is that the valence electron pairs surrounding an atom tend to repel each other, and will therefore adopt an arrangement that minimizes this repulsion, thus determining the molecule's geometry.
