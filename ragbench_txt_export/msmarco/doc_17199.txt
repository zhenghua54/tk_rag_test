Correspondent. Santiago, Chile, South America. Spanish is the official language in Chile... although some Spanish speakers may struggle to pick it up at first. Fourteen million of Chile's 16 million population speak Spanish as their first language. A few communities have their own indigenous languages: the Mapuche people speak Mapudungun; the people of Easter Island speak Rapa Nui; and in the far north, Quechua is spoken. Chilean Spanish is fast, furious and the end syllables are often missed off. To my ear, it sounds like the Chileans are eating their words.
