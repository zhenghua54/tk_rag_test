I have with my own experience seen my tomato plants take temps in the 40s when I was just a hobby grower with no real damage and I have read in these forums that people have had no problem with tomato plants surviving 40 degree nights when protected from wind in a greenhouse. About May 1 I get tired of dragging all my plants in and out of the garage every day, so move them down to the greenhouse. For the next 30 days, I feel fortunate to keep the temp above 40 every night. My tomato plants suffer no ill effects.
