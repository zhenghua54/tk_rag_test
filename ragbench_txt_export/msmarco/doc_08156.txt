Many babies outgrow newborn or 0- to 3-month clothes quickly, and some larger babies skip the newborn sizes completely and start with 3-month or 3- to 6-month sizes. Others will start out in preemie sizes and wear newborn clothes for months. The best tip is to buy clothing in several sizes and return what you don't use. How many of each item you 'll need will depend on how often you plan to do laundry, but we've provided rough guidelines below (in parentheses). Make sure to also read Baby and mom gear for the first six weeks to help you shop for other newborn essentials.
