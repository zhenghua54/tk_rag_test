If at all possible, the builder will prefer to use a mini digger. Although more expensive, the speed of the dig can give everyone a lift. On our current extension, the groundwork company, dug all the trenches for a 60m extension, filled them with concrete and cleared the spoil in 2 days! This is all based on the assumption that access for machinery is possible.
