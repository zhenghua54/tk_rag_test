Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal-that's why they're called fossil fuels) were formed from vegetation and yes, dinosaurs, deposited during the Carboniferous through the Permian eras which extended 380 to 245 million years ago. Once burned, however, fossil fuels cannot be used again, and they release gases such as carbon dioxide into the air. Such gases are not harmful in small amounts but the demand for energy is so great that millions of tons of these gases are released each year. This causes air pollution, which has a worldwide effect.
