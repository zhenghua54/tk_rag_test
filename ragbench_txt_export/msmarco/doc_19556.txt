The social contract is an agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In this, the notion of commutative justice, first brought forward by the primitive fact of exchange, ... is substituted for that of distributive justice ... The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent from any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the  state of nature . In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience.
