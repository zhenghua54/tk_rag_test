The Greeks called amber elektro, from which the word electricity is derived because if you rub amber with a cloth it will become charged, enabling it to attract small pieces of paper. For mineralogists, the Latin word succinum has come into usage as the word succinite, it's official name. However, since amber is organic, and is not inorganic with an ordered crystalline structure, it is NOT a mineral. Amber's color can vary depending on the source of the hardened tree resin. For example, the most common golden yellow, white, and ivory colored amber comes from pine trees. Cherry and plum trees produce an amber with more red, orange and brown tones.
