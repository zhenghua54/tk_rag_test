Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. A material is pushed through a die of the desired cross-section. 1 Aluminium is the most commonly extruded material. 2  Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. 3  If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100 °F (300 to 600 °C). 4  Examples of products include profiles for tracks, frames, rails, mullions, and heat sinks.
