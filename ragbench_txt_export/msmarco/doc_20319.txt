“Mr. Excitement” was replaced as one of Ganassi’s drivers with two years left on his contract. Media reports claimed Spencer’s salary was $1.1, $1.2 and $1.3 million for each season. Race winning percentages and performance bonuses were also part of that agreement. NASCAR also sanctions six regional tours and 86 grassroots-level short tracks in the United States, Canada and Mexico. There are literally thousands of drivers who don’t make money and actually spend money to race in NASCAR.
