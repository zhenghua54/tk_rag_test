Biogas. Biogas is a biofuel produced from the anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates in plant material or waste (eg food peelings or manure) by [bacterium: A type of single-celled microorganism.] bacteria. Biogas can be produced on a small scale in a biogas generator/digester, which can be made of simple materials. The carbohydrate-containing materials are fed in, and a range of bacteria anaerobically ferment the carbohydrate into biogas.
