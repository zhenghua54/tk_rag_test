Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. Some people find that one way to relieve their joint pain is to make changes in their diet. “There is no one food that helps everyone with rheumatoid arthritis,” says Scott Zashin, MD, a rheumatologist at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas and an author of Natural Arthritis Treatment. But some people find that eating foods that reduce inflammation can help ease their joint pain.
