Psychoanalytic psychotherapy developed out of the field of psychoanalysis. It is also variously referred to as insight-oriented psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, long-term, intensive, in-depth and expressive psychotherapy. Psychotherapy takes place within the context of a trusting relationship with a mental health professional. Psychotherapy is delivered in a wide range of settings from hospitals, to private offices.
