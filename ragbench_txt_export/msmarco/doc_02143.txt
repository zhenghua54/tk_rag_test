Cell Membrane Potentials. Cell membranes in general, and membranes of nerve cells in particular, maintain a small voltage or potential across the membrane in its normal or resting state. In the rest state, the inside of the nerve cell membrane is negative with respect to the outside (typically about -70 millivolts). If the cell membranes were simply permeable to these ions, they would approach an equilibrium with equal concentrations on each side of the membrane, and hence no voltage difference. This makes it clear that the processes which produce the membrane potential are not simply diffusion and osmosis.
