Sativa and Indica are the two major types of cannabis plants which can mix together to create hybrid strains. Each strain has its own range of effects on the body and mind resulting in a wide range of medicinal benefits. Indica plants typically grow short and wide, compared to Sativa plants which grow tall and thin. Indica plants are better suited for indoor growing because of their short growth and sativa plants are better suited for outdoor growing because some strains can reach over 25 ft. in height. You can see in the photos above Sativa plants tend to be significantly large while Indica plants are shorter and wider. Indicas are very effective for overall pain relief and is often used to treat insomnia for many people.
