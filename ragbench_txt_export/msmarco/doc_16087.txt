Double and triple shredded mulches are created by regrinding the mulch in a tub grinder, further reducing the particle size. Even though single shredded mulch is much less uniform with more large pieces of bark mixed into the product, it does last the longest when applied to landscape beds. The finer ground mulches are more popular due to their more uniform particle size, but they do tend to break down more rapidly.
