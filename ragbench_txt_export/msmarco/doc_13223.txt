Older Refrigerators. If you have a refrigerator that is more than around 15 years old, then you will most probably have a heavier than usual fridge. These can weigh as much as 250 pounds, which is nearly 100 kg. Refrigerators that were built after around 1995 will be lighter, and often feature removable parts that can be unscrewed prior to lifting. The average refrigerator from this age will weigh a little more than 200 pounds, which is equal to 90 to 91 kilograms.
