Step 2: Participate in an Internship. In order to obtain experience in the field, students in a cardiovascular technology program need to complete an internship in a medical setting. This is an opportunity for students to work and learn under an experienced cardiovascular technician and begin interacting with patients. During an internship, students can apply what they've learned in the classroom to a real-world setting.
