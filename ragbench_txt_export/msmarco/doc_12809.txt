Transparency is operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed. It has been defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from a sender. Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities. It guides an organization's decisions and policies on the disclosure of information to its employees and the public, or simply the intended recipient of the information. Transparency, as used in science, engineering, business, the humanities and in other social contexts, implies openness, communication, and accountability.
