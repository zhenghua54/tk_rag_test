Unfortunately Scheme and Common Lisp are like two siblings who are both very similar and very different. Thus they (or their proponents) fight a lot. The main difference is in the way the two language's standards work--Common Lisp's standard is big and standardizes a lot of things. The Scheme expression ((f)) is in Common Lisp either (funcall (f)) - if f is a function-or (funcall (funcall f)) - if f is a variable with a function as a value. In above example f is a variable. Scheme took all defun out of Lisp! — Fare. Faré'here s my take on this Whole-scheme-Vs-Common lisp. issue
