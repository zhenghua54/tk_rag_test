Between your full retirement age (see chart above), and the age of 70, your Social Security benefits will increase between 3 and 8 percent each year you delay your retirement. For example, for anyone born 1943 and later, their retirement benefits will increase by 8% for each year they delay until the age of 70. Under the Social Security laws, you can begin to receive your retirement payments once you hit the age of 62 (early retirement), at full retirement age (varies by year you were born), or at late retirement age (any age after your full retirement age).
