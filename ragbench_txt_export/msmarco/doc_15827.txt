1 Typha latifolia x Typha angustifolia hybrids (Typha X glauca), commonly known as Hybrid or Glaucus Cattail, are especially common in the Midwest and may develop extensive pure stands by rhizomatous growth. Name: 1  Typha, from the Greek, tufh (typhe), bulrush, cattail, perhaps from typhein, to smoke or to emit smoke, in allusion either to the use of the spikes for maintaining smoky fires or to the smoky brown color of the fruiting spikes.
