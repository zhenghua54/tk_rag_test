Parkinson disease-caused by mutations in the SNCA gene. At least 18 mutations in the SNCA gene have been found to cause Parkinson disease, a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement and balance. Several common variations in the SNCA gene have been found to increase the risk of multiple system atrophy, a progressive brain disorder that affects movement and balance and disrupts the function of the autonomic nervous system.
