Frequency = Frequency Density x Class Width. And this equals the area of the bar! If youâ€™re going to draw a histogram you first need to find the class boundaries and class widths. Example: The table below shows the heights of children in a class. Draw a histogram based on the data. First add columns with class width and frequency density to the table. Now you can draw your histogram. Note: In an exam you might just be given a histogram like this and asked, for example, how many children are between 80cm and 90cm. All you would need to do it work out the area of the bar between these values:
