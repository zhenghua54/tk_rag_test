Germany occupied Denmark, Norway and Poland. Although neutral, German troops were allowed across Sweden to Norway in the period after the invasion. Finland was a German ally f â€¦ ollowing the German invasion of Russia in 1941, and German forces were present in Finland on that basis, particularly in the far north. Yes Norway was occupied by Germany in World War 2. Trust me this is real, I had to do a report on Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Poland, and Germany.
