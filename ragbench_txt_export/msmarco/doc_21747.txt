Cation = iron(III) = Fe +3 (transition metal cation) Anion = chloride = Cl -1 (non-metal anion) To obtain a neutral compound, 1 Fe +3 is needed for every 3 Cl -1 The formula of the compound is FeCl 3 Example 9: Write the formula for magnesium phosphate. First identify the cation and anion in this compound. Example 10: Name the ionic compound Al(NO 3) 3. First identify the cation and anion in this compound. Cation = Al +3 = the aluminum cation (metal cation) Anion = NO 3-1 = the nitrate anion (polyatomic anion) The name of this compound is Aluminum Nitrate Example 11: Name the compound TiO 2.
