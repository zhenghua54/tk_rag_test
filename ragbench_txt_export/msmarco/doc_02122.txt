A reptile is an air-breathing animal that has scales instead of hair or feathers. Reptiles have lived on Earth for more than 280 million years. Scientists consider them to be the ancestors of birds and mammals. Over the years many kinds of reptiles have become extinct, or died out. The dinosaurs are well-known reptiles that became extinct about 65 million years ago.
