1 MERS-CoV is a type of coronavirus, similar to the one that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or the common cold. 2  MERS-CoV has not been previously identified in humans. 3  Like the SARS virus, MERS-CoV is most similar to coronaviruses found in bats. 1 The infection appears to be the result of spread of the virus from camels to humans, resulting in limited person-to-person spread but not sustained transmission in humans. 2
