Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in 1938 while Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Bruce Wayne's father, Thomas Wayne, dressed up like a Bat-Man for a costume party when Bruce was a little boy (he still has the costume), but Bruce himself was the first person to use a Batman persona to fight crime.
