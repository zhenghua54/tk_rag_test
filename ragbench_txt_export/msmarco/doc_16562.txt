In order to return a verdict to the court, the jury must vote and agree to the decisions contained in the verdict. It’s very important to make sure the verdict is accurate. The decisions contained in the verdict will decide whether the defendant will be found guilty or not guilty of a crime. There’s no exact best time the jury has to take a vote during the deliberations. Although jurors can take a vote as soon as they enter the jury room, it’s usually best to first hear all the jurors’ viewpoints and review the evidence and the law.
