Report Abuse. A leopard gecko's price can range anywhere between $20 at a pet store to $500 from big-time breeders. You might be able to find a 25 gallon tank in the Classifieds section of your local newspaper, or on craigslist.com. If not, you might be able to purchase one for around $100. Sand should not be used as a substrate. Report Abuse. The gecko costs around $24. An appropriate tank of 20 gallons at least, with a good hood, is like $50 or so. I dont know the sand cost, but you could spend $20-30 on things for the gecko to lay inside of and food dishes, etc.
