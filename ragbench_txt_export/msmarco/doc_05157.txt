The phosphate group is bonded to the 5 carbon of the sugar (see Figure 2), and when nucleotides are joined to form RNA or DNA, the phosphate of one nucleotide is joined to the sugar of the next nucleotide at its 3 carbon, to form the sugar-phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid. The sugar can be ribose, which is found in ribonucleotides and RNA, or deoxyribose, which is found in deoxyribonucleotides and DNA. The only difference between these two sugars is that deoxyribose has one fewer oxygen atom than ribose. The five carbon atoms in the sugar are numbered sequentially.
