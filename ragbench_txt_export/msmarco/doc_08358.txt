Menopause is defined as the date 12 months after a woman's last menstrual period. The average age for American women to reach menopause is 51 with a normal range of 39 to 59 years of age. At menopause, estrogen production slows. The earlier this occurs, the greater the risk to the heart and bones. One group of women are at particular risk from late menopause. These ladies have cumulative risks started with an early start of menstruation, before age 12. They never had a full-term pregnancy despite repeated attempts to conceive using fertility medications, and then they went into menopause late.
