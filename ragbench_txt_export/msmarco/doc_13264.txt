About 2 weeks to a month. I slightly dislocated my wrist and its kinda hard to type with this splint on. But if its slightly dislocated like mine, I would wear a splint for 1- â€¦ 3 weeks. I'm not a doctor but if you did dislocate it and it's really bad, please see a doctor. About 4-6 weeks, kind of a little bit longer Probably one of the worst piercings to get. I had double hip piercings and they backed out after about 4 months. Surface piercings are really a waste of money because eventually they will back out and leave you with a horrible scar.
