The cell cycle is the complex sequence of events by which cells grow and divide. In eukaryotic cells, this process includes a series of four distinct phases. These phases consist of the Mitosis phase (M), Gap 1 phase (G 1), Synthesis phase (S), and Gap 2 phase (G 2) . The G 1, S, and G 2 phases of the cell cycle are collectively referred to as interphase.
