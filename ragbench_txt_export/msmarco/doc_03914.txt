Serum levels generally parallel the extent of damage. Another enzyme, alanine aminotransferase or ALT, is primarily found in the liver. AST and ALT are often measured together as part of a liver function panel to detect liver damage. Description. AST is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and heart, but it is also found in many other tissues including the muscle, red blood cells, pancreas, kidney, and brain. Damage to these organs or hemolysis releases the enzyme, resulting in elevated AST levels in the serum.
