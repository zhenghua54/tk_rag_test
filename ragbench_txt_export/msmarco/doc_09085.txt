Transcription Factor. A transcription factor (blue) binds to DNA (red) and alters which genes are turned on, or expressed. Image courtesy of David S. Goodsell, RCSB Protein Data Bank. Transcription factors are proteins that control which genes are turned on or off in the genome. They do so by binding to DNA and other proteins. Once bound to DNA, these proteins can promote or block the enzyme that controls the reading, or “transcription,” of genes, making genes more or less active
