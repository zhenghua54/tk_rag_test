While asbestos was a practical material to make many products from, in the 1970’s it was banned in most respects and can no longer be used in the production of new products. However, there is still asbestos in homes all over the country. Much of the time, this is simply due to a lack of awareness. However, if you go in to remove the asbestos millboard, or what have you, it is possible that you’d damage the material in the process. This could stir up the fibers, making it easy for them to be inhaled or ingested. It is when these fibers are taken into the body in some way that problems can arise.
