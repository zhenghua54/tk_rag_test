Singulair can be taken with or without food. Singulair side effects are usually mild and they vary depending on the age of a patient. The most common side effects from taking Singulair are headache, soar throat, ear infection, respiratory infection, abnormal dreams, abdominal pain, fever, flu etc. But, we have noticed that many patients taking this medication have problems with weight gain, like in your case. However, weight gain is not listed as a side effect of taking Singulair. Maybe your eating habits have changed since you started taking this medicine. You should go to your doctor so that he can examine you and determine what is the cause for your weight gain. After a weight gain of 15-20 pounds, I discussed with my physician and was told that Singulair should not cause ANY weight gain. Through a series of changing my meds around (not recommended), I have come to the conclusion that Singulair has been the cause of this extra weight.
