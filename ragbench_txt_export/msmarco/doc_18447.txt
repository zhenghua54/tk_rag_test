A milonguero is a person who dances at milongas-social dances. Milonguero Tango is best suited for small or crowded dance floors such as those found in the downtowns of large cities, or those found in cafe's and restaurants. It is very different from the Tango in International and American ballroom dancing. Argentine Tango is an interpretive, improvisational social dance that allows the dancers to develop a deep connection between themselves, the music, and the environment in which they are dancing.
