Choice. Acid-base titrations often require color-changing indicators. In this titration type, an acidic solution reacts with a basic solution, and you don't know the concentration of one of them. The indicators for these titrations will change color at a certain point on the pH scale. When you reach the endpoint of your titration, the indicator changes color. This happens because any unreacted molecules in excess of those needed to reach the endpoint reacts with the indicator molecules. This changes the structure of the indicator molecule so that its color changes.
