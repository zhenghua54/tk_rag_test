Studies have looked at oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including orgasm, social recognition, pair bonding, anxiety, and maternal behaviors. As a medication, it is used to cause contraction of the uterus, which is used to start labor, increase the speed of labor, and to stop bleeding following delivery. 1 Uterine contraction: Important for cervical dilation before birth, oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of labor. 2  Oxytocin release during breastfeeding causes mild but often painful contractions during the first few weeks of lactation.
