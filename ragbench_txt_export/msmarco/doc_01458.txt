One unit of Electricity is consumed for every 1000 watts of consumption recorded by the Electricity meter over a period of 1 hour. So to run a 1000 watt heater continuously for 1 hour would use 1 unit of electricity, and at a cost of 13p per unit, a 1000 watt convector heater would cost 13p per hour to run. So to run a 2kw convector for 5 hours would cost you £1.30 based on an Electricity unit cost of 13 pence. Lets do the formula again, but this time using the rating of a 2500 watt convector heater, and an Electricity unit cost of 17p in the example. 2.5 (kw) x 5 (hours) x 17 (pence) = 212.5 Pence or £2.125.
