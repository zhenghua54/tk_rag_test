First, the insurance company will send you a bill for your next premium payment. Second, when it doesn't hear from you, the insurance company is going to formally cancel your policy because you failed to pay your premiums on time---and that's going to go on your credit report. Take care, however, to look over the information that your agent or the company filled in, mistakes do happen. In addition, if you switch insurers and you fail to formally cancel your previous policy, you're going to have to prove to your former insurance company that you have new coverage.
