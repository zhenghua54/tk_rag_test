A voice logger is a device or program used to record audio information from telephones, radios, microphones and other sources for storage on a computer's hard drive or removable media. There are two basic modes for recording: vox mode, which is voice-activated, and non-vox mode, in which the recording is continuous. Voice loggers are most often used by emergency services, such as the 911 system, and businesses, such as call center s. The recording systems are also used by security organizations and private individuals, although in these cases the legality of the practice may sometimes come into question.
