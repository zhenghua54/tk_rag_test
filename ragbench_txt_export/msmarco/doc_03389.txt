Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that limits the bloodâ€™s ability to clot. This condition can cause prolonged or excessive bleeding, which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical or dental procedure. Hemophilia is usually inherited from parents who have hemophilia or carry the abnormal gene.
