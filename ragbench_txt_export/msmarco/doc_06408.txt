Abdominal pain can also be caused by unrelated conditions, and it is not always (or even often) associated with blocked fallopian tubes. Still, the condition could be considered as a possibility for women who experience constant abdominal pain along with infertility or other symptoms of a blocked tube. Since pain from the condition is rare, and not all women notice or experience infertility, it is not uncommon for women with blocked tubes to go several years without knowing about their conditions. It is possible that millions of women actually have blocked fallopian tubes that are undiagnosed.
