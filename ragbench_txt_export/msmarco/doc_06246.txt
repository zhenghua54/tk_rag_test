Potty-training success hinges on physical and emotional readiness, not a specific age. Many kids show interest in potty training by age 2, but others might not be ready until age 2 1/2 or even older — and there's no rush. If you start potty training too early, it might take longer to train your child. Ready, set, go! When you decide it's time to begin potty training, set your child up for success. Start by maintaining a positive attitude — and recruiting all of your child's caregivers to do the same.
