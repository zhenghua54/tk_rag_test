Complexometric titration (sometimes chelatometry) is a form of volumetric analysis in which the formation of a colored complex is used to indicate the end point of a titration. Complexometric titrations are particularly useful for the determination of a mixture of different metal ions in solution. An indicator capable of producing an unambiguous color change is usually used to detect the end-point of the titration. Reactions for Complexometric Titration [edit]. In theory, any complexation reaction can be used as a volumetric technique provided that: 1  the reaction reaches equilibrium rapidly after each portion of titrant is added.
