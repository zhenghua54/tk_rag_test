Land snails are terrestrial gastropod mollusks that have shells (those without shells are known as slugs). In reality however, it is not always easy to say which species are terrestrial, because some are more or less amphibious between land and freshwater, and others are relatively amphibious between land and saltwater. The majority of land snails are pulmonates, i.e. they have a lung and breathe air. The lifespan of land snails varies from species to species. In the wild, Achatinidae snails live around 5 to 7 years and Helix snails live about 2 to 3 years. Many deaths are due to predators or parasites. In captivity, the lifespan of snails is much longer than in the wild, ranging from 10 to 15 years for many species.
