Kudos. FYI: The average backsplash area amounts to around 32 square feet (after doing this project for 35+ years). You hit the nail on the head when you mentioned our costs involved (i.e. insurance, tools, etc.). We are not the 8-12 dollar and hour kind of trade. It will take at least 1-1/2 days to complete a backsplash.
