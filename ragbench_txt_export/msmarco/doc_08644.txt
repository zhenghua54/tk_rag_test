If you want to use pickled pork in your recipes, I would encourage you to try out Alton Brown’s recipe in the video above. You can also find that recipe listed on page 181 of his Good Eats 3: The Later Years cookbook. Pickled pork can also be ordered online and shipped to you. And since pickled pork is such a fantastic way to season soups and beans — and since it seems to be such a fascinating culinary item — I decided to do two things for you: 1) Tell you what exactly pickled pork is, and 2) give you some links to recipes that use (or can use) pickled pork for seasoning.
