So here's a long one. (Pardon me for its length and its wandering; I was doing chain-of-thought writing :). Many people might say Manga are Japanese comics, and Anime is the Japanese version of animation. Anime is usually, but not always, the animated version of popular manga.. That's partially true, but it can be misleading. The heart of manga and anime is in the hearts of the characters. That brings us to three other aspects of manga and anime that I really like: the reality of the world, the spirituality, and the fact that things end. With comics, the merging of art and words creates a unique medium.
