A: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a diuretic (water pill) that is used to treat edema (fluid retention) that is caused by congestive heart failure, kidney disorders and several other reasons. HCTZ is also used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Hydrochlorothiazide may also be prescribed to treat calcium-containing kidney stones because it decreases the amount of calcium excreted by the kidneys in the urine, thus reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones.
