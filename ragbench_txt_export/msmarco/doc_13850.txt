Menai Bridge (Welsh: Porthaethwy) is a small town and community on the Isle of Anglesey in north Wales. It overlooks the Menai Strait and lies by the Menai Suspension Bridge, built in 1826 by Thomas Telford. It is the fifth largest settlement on the island, with a population of 3,376, and occupies the area of the former parish of Llandysilio, whose former church continues in use as a mortuary chapel (see below). It is likely that a community has existed at the location of Menai Bridge since Roman times simply because this is the shortest crossing of the Menai Strait. On 12 November 1918 Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst flew airship SSZ73 under the Menai Bridge following the armistice at the end of World War I.
