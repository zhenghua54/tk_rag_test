Diabetic fungal infection causes yellow and thickened nails for many of us with and without type 2 diabetes. But for diabetics it can lead to a serious complication. Onychomycosis (toenail fungus) may seem to be only an annoying cosmetic issue. But if left alone, thickened yellow toenail fungus can lead to bacterial infection. That makes it something you cannot ignore, because infections in diabetic feet can end in limb amputation.
