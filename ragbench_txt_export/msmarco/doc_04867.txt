Rick’s answer: Unfortunately, the short answer is no Kelsey. To the best of my knowledge there’s no way to find out who’s been looking at your Facebook profile, Timeline and photos. There are tons of apps out there that claim to give you that information if you install them, but as far as I can tell they are all scams. I recommend that you steer clear of them.
