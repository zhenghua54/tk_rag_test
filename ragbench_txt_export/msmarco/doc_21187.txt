Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is the major protein component of pulmonary surfactant, a material secreted by the alveolar type II cell that reduces surface tension at the alveolar airâ€“liquid interface. Surfactant protein A has been shown to regulate the homeostasis of surfactant phospholipids, facilitate the lowering of surface tension in the alveolus, and prevent the inhibition of surfactant function by plasma proteins.
