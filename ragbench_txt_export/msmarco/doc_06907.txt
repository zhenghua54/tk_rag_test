Sperm formation occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. This process is started by primitive stem cells called spermatogonia found on the outer edge of each tubule. Spermatogonia cells go through rapid mitotic divisions to build up the stem cell line. From birth until puberty, all such divisions simply produce more stem cells.
