Another distinction is the difference between substance and existence monism, or stuff monism and thing monism. Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff (e.g. matter or mind) exists, although many things may be made out of this stuff. Existence monism posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing (e.g. the universe), which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things. 1 Partial monism, within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance. 2  Existence monism, the view that there is only one concrete object token (The One, τὸ ἕν or the Monad).
