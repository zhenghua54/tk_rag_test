A fairly typical quote for a nonprovisional patent application (through filing) for a software innovation is $8,500 for attorneys fees plus the cost of the nonprovisional filing fee (typically $800) and the cost of any professional illustrations desired (typically $300 to $500). If we did the provisional the client has already paid $2,500 in attorneys fees, so the attorneys fees for the nonprovisional preparation and filing would be $6,000. Thus the total attorney fee does not change at all whether you start with a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application.
