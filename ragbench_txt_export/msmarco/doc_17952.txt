Appraisal Interview Downfalls. An appraisal interview is an exchange between a manager and an employee that is designed to evaluate the employee and create a career development plan. The manager can prepare a career development plan for the employee, but it is only effective if the employee agrees to take part in it. One of the downfalls of the appraisal interview is that a manager can expect the employee to be open to a developmental program.
