Today we know that most of the planet consists of gases-hydrogen and helium-and does not have a hard core, like the Earth. In 1994 a big comet crashed into Jupiter and stirred up the planet's atmosphere. Scientists could find out what kind of gases Jupiter's atmosphere is made up of. In 1989 NASA launched an unmanned spacecraft to Jupiter-Galileo. After 6 years, Galileo reached the planet and went into orbit. It sent a small probe through the clouds of Jupiter to find out more about the atmosphere.
