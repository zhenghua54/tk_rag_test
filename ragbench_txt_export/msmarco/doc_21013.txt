The AFQT standard (raw) score is computed with the formula 2VE+AR+MK. That standard score is then compared to a chart for the version of the ASVAB/AFCT you took to produce your true AFQT. The ASVAB/AFCT tests are made up of nine sections in the following order: 1  General Science (GS). 2  Arithmetic Reasoning (AR). Check with your local Navy Recruiter for updates.
