About Squamous Cell Skin Cancer. There are different types of cancer that start in the skin. The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the rarest form of skin cancer. It is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Non-melanoma skin cancers include basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. Basal cell cancer is the most common kind of skin cancer, but it usually grows slowly. Squamous cell cancer is somewhat more aggressive.
