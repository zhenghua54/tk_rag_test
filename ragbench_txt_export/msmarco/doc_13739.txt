Fibroblasts are the cells that make up the structural framework or stroma composed of the extracellular matrix and collagen in animal tissues. These cells are the most common type of connective tissue in animals, and are important for wound healing. Fibroblast transfection is a commonly used method in molecular and cell biology research, fibroblast transfection reagents are commercially available for both fibroblast cell lines and primary cells.
