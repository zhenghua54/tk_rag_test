4. Acid Start the Pool: The Acid Start procedure is a method of lowering the Total Alkalinity level in the pool to near 0.0, so that the water will absorb the plaster dust. It also helps to cure the plaster fast. My process for this is to add 1 gallon of Muriatic Acid for every 5,000 gallons of water. You can add the acid as the pool fills, just be sure to wait until you have at least 5,000 gals in the pool, and be careful not to splash any acid directly on the plaster walls or floor.
