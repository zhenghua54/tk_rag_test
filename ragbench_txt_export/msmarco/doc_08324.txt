(b) According to MadSci: The amount of air breathed by an average adult varies from 6 Litre/minute (when at rest) to 50 Litre/minute after hard exercise. So, at rest the amount of Oxygen absorbed by the blood in the lungs is 300 milliLitre/minute to 3,500 mL/minute. My Calculations for a person at rest: In 1 day the volume of O2 absorbed by a person at rest is 300mL/minute x 60 minute/hour x 24 h/day = 432,000 mL/day or 432 L/day.
