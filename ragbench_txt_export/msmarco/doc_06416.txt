One of the major causes of infertility is fallopian tube obstruction. The fallopian tubes are the uterine tubes where fertilization occurs. When they are blocked, the sperm and the egg cannot meet, thus, the egg cannot be fertilized. In fact, blocking the fallopian tubes is sometimes used as a contraceptive method.
