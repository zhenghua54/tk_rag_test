Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness marked by unstable moods, behavior, and relationships. In 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) listed BPD as a diagnosable illness for the first time. While mental health experts now generally agree that the name borderline personality disorder is misleading, a more accurate term does not exist yet. Most people who have BPD suffer from: 1  Problems with regulating emotions and thoughts. 2  Impulsive and reckless behavior. 3  Unstable relationships with other people.
