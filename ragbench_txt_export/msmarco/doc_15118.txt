Top 10 facts about the world. A sarcomere is the basic functional unit of striated muscle, which is to say, itâ€™s the basic building block of most muscle cells. In the human body, each muscle is made up of multiple bundles of muscle fibers. These muscle fibers, in turn, are comprised of numerous finer strands called myofibrils. Muscle movement happens when the filaments slide across each other within the muscular bands. The sliding filament model is made possible by the interaction of the actin and myosin proteins within the filaments.
