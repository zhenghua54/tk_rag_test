For example, a spirited discussion revolves around the origin of conch saladâ€™s cousin ceviche (also spelled cebiche). This seafood salad, made of raw fish or shellfish marinated in sour fruit juices and laced with raw onion rings and hot peppers, is one of the many gifts ancient Peru bestowed on New World cuisine. The Moor-influenced cooks introduced a dish called Sei-vech, made of fish or meat marinated in the juice of Ceuta lemons, which they brought with them from North Africa and planted in the New World.
