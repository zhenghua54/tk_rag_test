Alcohol abuse creates an internal environment that predisposes individuals to malnutrition. Alcohol must be processed by the digestive system, which creates competition for limited nutritional resources that would normally nourish the body. 1 Because alcohol is a diuretic that increases the output of urine, it can cause the loss of such water-soluble minerals such as zinc, magnesium and potassium. 2  Zinc status appears to be particularly affected by alcohol and zinc deficiency interferes with the ability to taste and smell, further limiting dietary intake.
