A pulse is a wave packet containing broad range of frequencies. A pulse (wave packet) is a localized disturbance that results from the sum of many different wave forms. The wave is the transport of disturbances in space, not associated with motion of the medium occupying this space as a whole. As there is but one pulse, the wave travels through water at velocity v and that one wave's energy compresses and releases water as the wave travels through the water.
