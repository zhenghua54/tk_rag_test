Extension springs are under extreme tension when the garage door is in the closed position. As you will see in the video, cables, extension springs and bottom brackets must only be worked on when the garage door is in the open position and properly clamped open. Extension springs should be replaced in pairs. Unequal pull will result of replacing one extension spring and your garage door will not function properly. Always unplug and detach your garage door opener from garage door before any repair. replacing a broken cable or spring (other parts too)in overhead garage door.
