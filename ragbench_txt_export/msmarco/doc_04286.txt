Chief of the General Staff Helmuth von Moltke made several changes to the Schlieffen Plan. One of his changes was that he weakened the right wing of the German army, which was invading France by way of Belgium, in order to strengthen the left-wing, which was defending Alsace-Lorraine against the French invasion. The Schlieffen Plan (German language: Schlieffen-Plan, [ʃliːfən plaːn]) was the German General Staff 's early 20th-century overall strategic plan for victory in a possible future war in which the German Empire might find itself fighting on two fronts: France to the west and Russia to the east.
