Adding on to any home, whether it is an expansion of the existing footprint or an entirely new level is a very complex project. For this discussion we will examine the requirements and general costs associated with adding a single-story 192 square foot (12'x16') room. 1 The above figures place the cost of the addition at $124 per square foot. 2  This pricing structure assumes that carpenters charge an average of $70 per hour, electricians between $65 to $85 per hour, and painters between $20 and $35 per hour.
