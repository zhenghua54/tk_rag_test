Rabbit mothers only tend to their babies when it is time to feed them. Wild rabbits will only visit a nest once or twice a day for only 5 minutes to feed-this is their way of not bringing attention to the nest and to protect it from predators. Baby wild rabbits leave the nest much sooner than domesticated rabbits.
