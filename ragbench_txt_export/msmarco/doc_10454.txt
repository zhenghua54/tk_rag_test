Some other tests that may be performed in conjunction with cardiolipin antibody tests include lupus anticoagulant testing (e.g., DRVVT) and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I antibody. There are three classes of cardiolipin antibodies that may be present in the blood: IgG, IgM and/or IgA. The two most commonly tested are IgG and IgM. However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then IgA cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered. Occasionally, cardiolipin testing may be ordered to help determine the cause of a positive VDRL/RPR test for syphilis. The reagents used to test for syphilis contain phospholipids and can cause a false positive result in those with cardiolipin antibodies.
