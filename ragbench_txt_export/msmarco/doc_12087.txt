Capillary Electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is an analytical separation technique. It is especially used in clinical and research fields, and molecular biology. It deals with the separation and characterization of molecules like proteins, nucleic acids, small organelles and viruses. The capillary electrophoresis is easy method and can be used for small ions to macromolecules like proteins, peptides, chiral compounds, nucleic acid. The electrophoresis involves the migration of ions and the opposite charged ions are attracted towards to the oppositely charged electrodes.
