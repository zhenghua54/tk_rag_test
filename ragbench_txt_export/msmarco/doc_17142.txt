Aerobic vs Anaerobic Bacteria. There are two types of organisms and tiny single-celled bacteria called aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the human body. Aerobics are able to use oxygen, whereas anaerobic bacteria can sustain itself without the presence of oxygen. Summary: 1. Aerobic bacteria inhales oxygen to remain alive. 2. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids O2. 3. Aerobic respiration produces energy with the help of a complex process in the cells. 4. Anaerobic respiration produces crystals, and causes pain in muscled areas.
