With the above figures of 0.5 liters/breath, 15 breath per minute, and 67.2 years in a lifetime we can calculate our total breathing volume: There are 60 x 24 X 365.25 minutes in a year. This is 525,960 minutes. In a lifetime (of 67.2 years) we have 35,344,512 minutes (so you have about 35 million minutes of breathing space). An average person will breathe 0.5 (liters/breath) x 15 (breaths/minute) x 35,344,512 (minutes/lifetime), which equals 265,083,840 liters/lifetime. More or less 265 million liters of air. We have calculated that we breathe about 265 million liters of air in a life time
