Air enters the body through the nose or mouth, passes through the larynx, down the trachea, and into our lungs. Once it is in your lungs, air goes through a maze of smaller and smaller bronchial tubes until it reaches clusters of tiny sacs the alveoli. In appearance they are somewhat like bunches of grapes. The alveoli are the primary gas exchange units of the lung. Quite simply, they are the point where the gas-blood barrier is thin enough to permit rapid gas exchange.
