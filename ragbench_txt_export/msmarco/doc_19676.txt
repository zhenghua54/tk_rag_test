Composition of the Blood. When a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, the cells and cell fragments are separated from the liquid intercellular matrix. Because the formed elements are heavier than the liquid matrix, they are packed in the bottom of the tube by the centrifugal force. The light yellow colored liquid on the top is the plasma, which accounts for about 55 percent of the blood volume and red blood cells is called the hematocrit ,or packed cell volume (PCV). The white blood cells and platelets form a thin white layer, called the buffy coat, between plasma and red blood cells.
