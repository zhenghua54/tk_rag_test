When the Medicare and Medicaid law was passed, the Medicare Part B premium was set at $3 a month. By the early 1970s, the legislation had evolved to include disabled citizens and those with end-stage renal disease (regardless of age) in the list of people eligible for Medicare coverage. A decade later, the Medicare program included hospice benefits, but only on a temporary basis. Changes were also made to the Medicare legislation to cover federal employees, including the U. S. President and members of Congress.
