The first members of the clean-up crew are the scavengers. They are attracted to a dead animal by the smell, and by seeing other scavengers. A familiar scavenger is the turkey vulture. These fascinating birds are very well adapted to their jobs, using their excellent sense of smell to find their food. Yuck!! The scavengers and decomposers help move energy through the food chain. Bacteria and fungi return it to the soil where plants can once again use it. (See the picture below.) Consumers use it as they eat the plants or the scavengers and decomposers. Many food chains are created and these food chains become a food web with living things all dependent upon each other for survival
