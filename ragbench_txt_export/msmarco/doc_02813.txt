Qualifying Criteria. You can apply for the tax credit if you have installed your energy-efficient appliances in 2009 and before December 31, 2010. Unfortunately, only the appliances listed above are eligible and you cannot receive a tax credit for energy-efficient dishwashers, dryers or other common appliances. The amount of credit you receive depends on how much you spent on energy-efficient appliances. The tax credit is 30 percent of the total cost of the energy-efficient appliance, including any installation costs.
