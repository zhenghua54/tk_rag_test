Using a capo is easy. You just have to think of it as a movable nut. Clamp it on the fret you will use for the key you are playing in, and just play chords or picking from a key you know. You can play in G using chords from the key of F if you put the capo on the second fret. Using chords from the key of C, you can play in the key of D (with the capo still on the 2nd fret).
