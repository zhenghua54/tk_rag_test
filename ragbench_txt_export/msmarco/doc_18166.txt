In the Lewis theory of acid-base reactions, bases donate pairs of electrons and acids accept pairs of electrons. A Lewis acid is therefore any substance, such as the H + ion, that can accept a pair of nonbonding electrons. In other words, a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor. A Lewis base is any substance, such as the OH-ion, that can donate a pair of nonbonding electrons. A Lewis base is therefore an electron-pair donor. One advantage of the Lewis theory is the way it complements the model of oxidation-reduction reacti
