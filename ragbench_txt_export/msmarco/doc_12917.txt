Find out what recruiters want to hear in your answer. The current vogue in the graduate recruitment world for strengths-based interviews (which focus on what you enjoy doing and what you do well) means that youâ€™re more likely to come across this old interview question than ever before. This question helps recruiters to find out more about you as a person. Your answer can give them some insight into: 1  What makes you tick. 2  What you enjoy doing and what you value. 3  Whether you would do well in the job role. 4  How you would fit into their team.
