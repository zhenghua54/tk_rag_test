Toss the chicken with the baking sauce. Spread the chicken in the baking dish. No need to grease the dish. Just lay the chicken inside. Bake for 20 minutes or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165Â°F. Boneless, skinless thighs cook quickly. Check after 20 minutes, and if they are not quite up to temperature, put back in the oven and continue cooking and checking the temperature in 5-minute increments. Remove the chicken from the oven and rest the meat, covered, for 10 minutes. Cover the baking dish with foil and let the chicken rest. This will help it be more tender. Eat and enjoy!
