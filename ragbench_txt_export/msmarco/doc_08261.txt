Plumeria Rubra. The most common frangipani is the Plumeria Rubra. Rubra come in many colours, from white to cream to yellow, even oranges, pinks (both pale and hot pink), reds and even deep cerise. They also come in multiple colours (such as pink, apricot and yellow in the one flower). And Rubra has the most fragrant flowers! The leaves from a Plumeria Rubra are long and oval and have quite a pointed end. The leaves are quick to drop off as the winter coolness approaches. A Plumeria Rubra can grow to 5m tall and almost as wide.
