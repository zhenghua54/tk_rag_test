Depending on the material, it can weigh up to 2000 pounds (1 cu yard of sand is 2000 pounds-that â€¦ 's a lot of sand!) To be more precise, there are online calculators to help you determine how much you need -- you will need to know the area you want to cover in square feet, and to what depth. One ton of feathers makes more cubic feet than say for instance one ton of silver. So to make this conversion you must know two constants, the weight per CF or CY for that matter and how many cubic feet you have. In this case it is 27 cubic feet or a yard. Awenow.
