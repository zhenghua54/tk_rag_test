Step 2: Determining the cost of the carpet. Carpet prices range anywhere from $0.50 to over $10 per square foot. Most homes will want a carpet that is between $2-$4 per square foot, but this is by no means a rule. The carpet specifications you need for your life style and the kind of deal you strike will have a big impact on the carpet price. Carpet pad cost: $0.30 to $0.60 sq/ft. Carpet installation cost: $0.50 sq/ft. For budgeting purposes, adding $1.00 sq/ft. for padding and installation to the carpet cost gives a good estimate. Captain’s parting words: There’s no exact answer for how much carpet costs.
