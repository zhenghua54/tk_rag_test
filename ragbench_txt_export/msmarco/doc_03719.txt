About how much to charge: I don't know what state you live in, but if you're working for a surgeon living in a 6000 sq ft home, I would go with a minimum of $30 an hour, and do not bust your butt at going super fast. That is a lot of repetitive motion for the shoulders and believe me, bursitis will kick in.
