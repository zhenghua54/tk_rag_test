By AlecFoth, Jul 20, 2015. I know of the CW has already cancelled the Messengers, but starting a show mid season on a Friday night is already a knife in its side, they didn't even give it a chance!. The show has actually gotten better and better each episode. By MagdaOciepka, Jul 28, 2015. To all the fans of The Messengers, if you want to try and save this show, please sign the petition and maybe we can make a difference. I shared it with my friends and I'm trying to pass it on as far as I can. Please do the same! The petition is on http:/ /www .ipetitions
