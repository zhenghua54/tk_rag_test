In my opinion, I would recommend you have anywhere from 6-10 sleepers in each size for your newborn. That being said, you may want to buy less sleepers in newborn size if you know that you are carrying a larger baby or you want the sleepers to last longer and don’t mind then being big for the first week or two. If you don’t mind doing laundry every other day, then you may only need 5-6 sleepers in each size. This would give you enough sleepers to plan for changes throughout the day due to diaper blowouts and spit ups.
