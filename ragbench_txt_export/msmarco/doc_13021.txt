If you’re sued, general liability insurance will cover the cost of your damages or settlement fees and attorney fees up to the policy maximum. So, if you buy a $1 million policy and the settlement is $1.5 million, you’ll be on the hook for the remaining $500,000. However, general liability insurance is still affordable. Most contractors pay from $700 to $1,200 per year for general liability insurance. The payments are usually structured as a down payment of several hundred dollars and monthly payments spread out over nine or ten months.
