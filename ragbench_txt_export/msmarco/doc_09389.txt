Progesterone is a natural diuretic and in theory should not cause weight gain and in fact can promote weight loss when necessary (estrogen is cited as a weight maintainer). But, I started to balloon. Talk about distress. My middle grew about six inches and my poor little 36 barely A's were crying for a larger bra. There is some evidence that the patch might have a slightly lower risk of blood clots because it does not go into the intestinal tract and bypasses your liver. Weight gain should not differ between one form of estrogen and the other.
