Structural steel shape, size, composition, strength, storage, etc., is regulated in most industrialized countries. This is due to the much larger volume required for a structural concrete member to support the same load; steel, though denser, does not require as much material to carry a load. However, this advantage becomes insignificant for low-rise buildings, or those with several stories or less.
