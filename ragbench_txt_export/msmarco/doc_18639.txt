Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization with offices in over forty countries and with an international coordinating body in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Greenpeace argues that because of Arctic oil drilling, an oil spill could hurt vulnerable ecosystems. It is because the drilling project in the Hoop area of the Barents Sea is too close to the sea ice and to Bear Island 175 kilometers (110 miles) away.
