A stigma is defined as a powerfully negative label that changes a person's self-concept and social identity. Labeling theory is closely related to social-construction and symbolic-interaction analysis. The labeling theory suggests that people obtain labels from how others view their tendencies or behaviors. Each individual is aware of how they are judged by others because he or she has attempted many different roles and functions in social interactions and has been able to gauge the reactions of those present.
