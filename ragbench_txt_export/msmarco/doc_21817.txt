To answer that question we need to know just how much do people spend on food on average on both an average diet and a real food diet. According to the USDA the average family of four is spending somewhere between $544 to $1235 per month for food eaten at home. Thatâ€™s a huge range! They break it down into 4 plans: Thrifty, low-cost, moderate, and liberal. For a family of 4 that is $600 per month, with some families coming in a lot lower. The average USDA monthly food budget for that same family is $840. My family ranks toward the high end of the range mainly because we like to eat a larger amount of meat, raw milk and fresh cheese.
