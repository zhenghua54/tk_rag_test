What You Can Do. Travellers on a UK Working Holiday Visa can holiday in the UK for 24 months. The work permit on the visa allows you to work for 12 of the 24 months in any job, except if you are a professional sportsperson or intend to set up a business. To apply for a UK Working Holiday Visa, first check to see if your country of origin is a participating country in the visa programme, at the UK Visa Bureau website. It is possible that countries outside of the list on the Visa Bureau website are included in the programme.
