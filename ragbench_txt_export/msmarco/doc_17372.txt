God is talking to Moses and Moses is basically asking God what name he is to say to the people when they ask. â€¦ Now here is the kicker. I... do not believe that God is responding with his name or WHO he is per se. God is telling Moses WHAT he is, not his name. Names are labels that have a huge affect on people. The meaning of a person's name can make them feel more noble or comfortable with who they are... being named after someone can cause a lot of introspection and either rebellion against that example, or close following of the same. + 3 others found this useful.
