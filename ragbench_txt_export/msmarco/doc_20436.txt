The average start-up cost of a restaurant is between $100,000 and $300,000, according to Forbes.. While starting a neighborhood sandwich shop is going to cost significantly less than opening a new five-star restaurant, you will still have to contend with expenses fundamental to the food service business. Expensive food such as filet mignon or salmon will cost more per pound so, for your sandwich shop, your costs can be much lower. Don't skimp on the menu items that will be your specialties, and consider what store-bought items you will make from scratch such as sauces and breads.
