The chest x-ray is the most commonly performed diagnostic x-ray examination. A chest x-ray produces images of the heart, lungs, airways, blood vessels and the bones of the spine and chest. An x-ray (radiograph) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions. A chest x-ray is typically the first imaging test used to help diagnose symptoms such as: 1  shortness of breath. 2  a bad or persistent cough. 3  chest pain or injury. 4  fever.
