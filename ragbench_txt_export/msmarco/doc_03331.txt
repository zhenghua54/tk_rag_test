If you want to convert from an electric furnace to a gas furnace, you will need to have gas piping and ductwork installed first. This will add an additional up-front cost to the furnace and installation process of around $5,000 to $15,000 or more depending on the space. As with gas and electric furnaces, installation costs are generally higher for the pricier furnaces since they are installed by HVAC professionals with more experience. The oil furnace prices listed below are based on the size of a furnace needed to heat a standard home that is 1600-2000 square feet.
