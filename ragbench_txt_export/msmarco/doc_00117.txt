Don't be so nervous about an interview. When I interview people that I can tell are really nervous I tell them not to be, I'm not gonna ask them something they can't answer because I'm gonna ask you questions about you and what your capable of. Any... show more I have an interview tomorrow, and I'm so nervous that I'm awake and rehearsing answers to questions I think might come up. I realized that some of them are short.
