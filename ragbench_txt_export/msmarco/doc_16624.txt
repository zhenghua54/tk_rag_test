What Is Fiber Reinforced Concrete. Fiber reinforced concrete is a type of concrete that includes fibrous substances that increase its structural strength and cohesion. Fiber reinforced concrete has small distinct fibers that are homogeneously dispersed and oriented haphazardly. After the reinforcement of concrete by steel, it becomes a composite group in which the steel endures the tensile stresses. When concrete is reinforced by using fiber in the mixture, it further increases the tensile strength of the composite system.
