One of the specific types of connective tissue is fibrous connective tissue, or FCT. This high-strength, slightly stretchy tissue consists mainly of collagen, a protein which is known for providing strength and stability. Connective tissue is one of the four main tissue types; the others are epithelial tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Connective tissue includes tissues such as cartilage, bone, blood and fat. In this lesson, we'll be specifically looking at fibrous connective tissue.
