Create a hierarchical binary cluster tree using linkage. Then, plot the dendrogram for the complete tree (100 leaf nodes) by setting the input argument P equal to 0. Now, plot the dendrogram with only 25 leaf nodes. Return the mapping of the original data points to the leaf nodes shown in the plot. If there are more than 30 data points, then dendrogram collapses lower branches so that there are 30 leaf nodes. As a result, some leaves in the plot correspond to more than one data point.
