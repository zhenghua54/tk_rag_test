In my own experiences, hydrangeas grow best where they receive morning sun (until 10 or so) and shade the balance of the day. In areas with black, alkaline soils, they should be planted much like azaleas. Dig a hole 15 to 18 inches deep and 3 feet wide for each plant. Remove all of the native soil. Itâ€™s pretty amazing what a difference 25 or 50 miles can make in the plants you can grow. Hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla) are staples of East Texas landscaping, yet they play out as you drive west onto the Blackland Prairie soils here in North Central Texas.
