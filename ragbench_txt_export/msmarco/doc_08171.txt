Overview. Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) is grown as a perennial in USDA horticultural zones 8 to 11 and as an annual or container plant everywhere else. It is a clumping grass that grows to 4 feet tall and wide. The bulbous stems are used in Asian and Caribbean dishes, where they are smashed to release the oils. The location needs to be well-drained, as lemon grass cannot sit in waterlogged soil for long periods of time. If you are planting more than one plant, the plants need to be spaced 3 or 4 feet apart. They will grow to full size in one season.
