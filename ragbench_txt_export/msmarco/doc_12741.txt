Fire TV is primarily for Amazon Prime users. Unlike Roku or Apple TV, Amazon’s interface has Amazon Prime DNA pretty much embedded throughout, and that’s an annual service that costs another $99 (bringing your total all the way up to $240, plus the recurring subscription fee, if you opt for the Fire TV gamepad).
