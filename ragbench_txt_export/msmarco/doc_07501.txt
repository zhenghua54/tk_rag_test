The discovery of mercury as an element was in the 18th century. Incidentally, at about the same time, also 3000 years ago, the Sumerians discovered the planet Mercury. Like the Babylonians who discovered mercury and put in many records but not as an element, the Sumerians recorded the planet mercury quite a lot.
