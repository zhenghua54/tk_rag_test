Surgeons with the most expertise cost more, but for this kind of complex, highly visible cosmetic surgery, it's advisable to use a very experienced surgeon. Facelift cost comprises three fees: the anesthesia fee, the facility fee, and the surgeon's fee. The surgeon's fee is the majority of the cost, and the most difficult to predict without first knowing the extent of the procedure and the qualifications of the plastic surgeon. The average cost of facelift cosmetic surgery ranges from $6,000 to $15,000. The cost for anesthesia ranges from $1,000 to $1,300. The facility fee (or hospital fee) ranges from $500 to $2,000.
