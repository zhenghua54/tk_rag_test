People who had a face-lift and neck lift looked an average of 5.7 years younger post-surgery. Adding in eyelid work shaved off nearly two additional years, and adding a forehead lift on top of that took off about another year. People who had all four procedures were said to look 8.4 years younger in their after picture.
