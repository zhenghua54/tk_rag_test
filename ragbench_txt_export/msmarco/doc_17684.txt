NMDA receptors are present in many but not in all neurons of the cerebral cortex. Moriyoshi et al. (8) reported that (NMDAR1)....mRNA is expressed in almost all the neuronal cells throughout the brain regions (p. 36). Since then it has been assumed that virtually all cells express NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors are formed by different subunits belonging to two classes: NMDAR1 (NR1) and NMDAR2 (NR2) (3-7). The first subunit to be characterized, NR1, exhibits the basic features of the NMDA receptor when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (8), and can exist in several isoforms generated by alternative splicing (9).
