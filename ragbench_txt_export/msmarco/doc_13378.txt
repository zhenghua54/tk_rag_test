Introduction. This document explains how to configure Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) on a Cisco router using Radius or TACACS+ protocols. The goal of this document is not to cover all AAA features, but to explain the main commands and provide some examples and guidelines. Note: The server (Radius or TACACS+) will not reply to an aaa authentication request sent by the access server if there is no IP connectivity, if the access server is not correctly defined on the AAA server or the AAA server is not correctly defined on the access server.
