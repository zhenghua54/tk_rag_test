These are contracted by the physical traumatic implantation of the fungus and generally remain limited to the area around the inoculation. Examples of subcutaneous fungal infections include: mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and sporotrichosis. The familiar fuzzy colonies of molds are, of course, macroscopic. However, they form microscopic spores that are often the infecting form of the organism either by inhalation or by direct traumatic implantation through the skin.
