NAVSEA's primary objective is to engineer, build and support the U.S. Navy's fleet of ships and its combat systems. NAVSEA accounts for one quarter of the Navy's entire budget, with more than 150 acquisition programs under its oversight. The Naval Sea Systems Command was established on 1 July 1974 with the merger of the Naval Ship Systems Command with the Naval Ordnance Systems Command. The Naval Ship Systems Command was established in 1966 replacing the Navy's Bureau of Ships (BuShips).
