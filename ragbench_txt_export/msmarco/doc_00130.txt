Long-term disability (LTD) benefits pay a percentage of your salary or wages and can be increased by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and/or decreased by offsets of other benefits, earnings from work, and taxes. The offset works like this: if you receive $1,400 in LTD benefits and are approved for $1,100 from Social Security, you will receive the full $1,100 from Social Security, but only $300 from your insurance company, for a total of $1,400.
