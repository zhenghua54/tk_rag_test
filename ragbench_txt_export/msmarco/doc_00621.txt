Interstitial fluid or tissue fluid is a solution that bathes and surrounds the tissue cells of multicellular animals. Not all of the contents of the blood pass into the tissue, which means that tissue fluid and blood are not the same. Red blood cells, platelets, and plasma proteins cannot pass through the walls of the capillaries. The resulting mixture that does pass through is, in essence, blood plasma without the plasma proteins.
