More specifically, for the 30% of men in the 60 to 64 age group with more than $100,000 in super, the average balance was around $338,000 while for the 12% of women in that age group with more than $100,000 in super the average was $236,000. Median balances were considerably lower given that many individuals have no or little superannuation. With average retirement payouts in 2003-04 of the order of $110,000 for men and only $37,000 for women clearly most recent retirees will need to substantially rely on the Age Pension in their retirement.
