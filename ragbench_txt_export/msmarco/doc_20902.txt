Curious about demolition cost. Just read in the weekend paper that the cost to demolish a house is about $5,000. Is that right. I would have thought it double that. Though this was in the glassy magazine section that praised the virtues of Knock down rebuild. And that renovating an old place costs twice as much as building.
