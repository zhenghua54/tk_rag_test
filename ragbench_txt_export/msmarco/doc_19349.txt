This test measures the amount of the protein albumin in your blood. Your liver makes albumin. Albumin carries substances such as hormones, drugs, and enzymes throughout your body. This test can help diagnose, evaluate, and watch kidney and liver conditions. When your kidneys begin to fail, albumin starts to leak into your urine. This causes a low albumin level in your blood.
