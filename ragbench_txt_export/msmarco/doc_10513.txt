How much your monthly disability check will be depends on whether you'll receive Social Security Disability (SSD) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSD is for workers who are insured under the Social Security retirement system. Social Security applies a formula to your average lifetime earnings to calculate the amount of your monthly check. The average SSD payment is currently $1,165. The highest dollar amount you can receive from SSD monthly in 2015 is $2,663.
