There is a strong electrical force of attraction between these free electrons (mobile electrons or 'sea' of delocalised electrons) () and the 'immobile' positive metal ions (+) that form the giant lattice and this is the metallic bond. The reason for this is the mobility of the electrons involved in the metallic bonding. When planes of metal atoms are 'bent' or slide the electrons can run in between the atoms and maintain a strong bonding situation.
