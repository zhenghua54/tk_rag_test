There are three varieties of cartilage, hyaline, elastic, and fibrocartilage. The most abundant type is hyaline, found as supportive tissues in the nose, ears, trachea, larynx, and smaller respiratory tubes. As articular cartilage, hyaline is found covering the articular surfaces of bones in synovial joints. Here, hyaline cartilage reduces friction and acts as shock-absorbing tissue.
