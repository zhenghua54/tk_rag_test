Marinwood. Marinwood and the local surrounding communities make a wonderful place to call home! Just a short drive from Highway 101, the unincorporated community of Marinwood is the first town you reach on your drive to West Marin along Lucas Valley Road. The northernmost neighborhood of San Rafael is made up of 1900 acres which are bordered by open spaces of 800 acres. The Marinwood Community Center even has a preschool as part of the Recreation Center. You can rent BBQ areas or even the pool for parties. Throughout the year the Recreation Department puts on Friday Summer nights with live music, Holiday family activities and much more.
