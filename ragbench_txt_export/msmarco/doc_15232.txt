Coeliac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disease where the bodyâ€™s immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. About 500,000 people in the UK are living with undiagnosed coeliac disease without realising it. There are a range of symptoms including constant mouth ulcers, crippling fatigue, stomach pain, regular bouts of diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss.
