I have an airtight greenhouse that is 10x20x8 that has greenhouse plastic on it. I need to start growing my plants in the next week or so but I am worried about temperatures. I can keep the greenhouse at about 45-50 if the temp drops to the low 20s other than that the temp will stay in the 50s at night. When I first started growing plants 5 years ago in an unheated greenhouse my tomato seedlings in flats survived in the greenhouse unheated to temps in the low 40s without any damage. About May 1 I get tired of dragging all my plants in and out of the garage every day, so move them down to the greenhouse. For the next 30 days, I feel fortunate to keep the temp above 40 every night. My tomato plants suffer no ill effects.
