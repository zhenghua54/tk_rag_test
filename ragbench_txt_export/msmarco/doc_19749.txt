You can also try using the paint pads for your doors. They work pretty well too. If you don't use Lowe's American Tradition Eggshell, Satin or Semi-Gloss (all washable), then other decent paints are Kelly Moore and Dun Edwards (only available in a few western states). Best Answer: Before repainting over the patch, make sure it is smoothed out more to match the rest of the door. Lightly sand the door and trim before repainting. I would prime it as well which should help resolve the patch showing through. I've used most all of the better quality and well known paints
