Aerobic bacteria, when compared to anaerobic bacteria, uses O2 for cellular respiration. Anaerobic respiration means an energy cycle with less efficiency to produce energy. Aerobic respiration is energy given off by a complex process when O2 and glucose metabolize together inside the cellâ€™s mitochondria. Summary: 1. Aerobic bacteria inhales oxygen to remain alive. 2. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids O2. 3. Aerobic respiration produces energy with the help of a complex process in the cells. 4. Anaerobic respiration produces crystals, and causes pain in muscled areas.
