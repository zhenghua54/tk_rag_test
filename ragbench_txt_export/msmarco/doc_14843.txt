Becoming an electrical engineer requires training, commitment, and the willingness to wonder about questions such as how a flat screen television manages to be energy efficient or how a Las Vegas casino manages to use so much electricity without blowing a fuse. Most electrical engineers must have a bachelor’s degree or even a master’s degree in electrical engineering from a university accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).
