I opted to change the name of the old device to iPod, within the device, before opening iTunes on the Mac. To do so, first, put the 4s in Airplane Mode, and turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Later, when you open iTunes on your Mac you will see the button for 2 Devices, in my case 3 Devices including my iPad. 2. Change the name of the old phone in iTunes (click on the name of the old phone on the summary page). 4. On the same Message settings screen, Add another email (my daughter's in this case). I had to go in and verify it with Apple-it sends an email to facilitate this. Make sure the new email is checked.
