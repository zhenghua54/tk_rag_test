If magnetic north is east of true north, the local declination is positive. If magnetic north is west of true north, the local declination is negative. B) Draw a line on the map that connects your starting point with the destination (your map bearing). Magnetic declination is the direction and amount of variation between the Magnetic Pole and True North. The amount and direction of declination depends upon how those two poles align relative to a given point on Earth.
