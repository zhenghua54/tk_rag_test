Best Answer: Normally. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body, and the heart returns oxygenated blood to the body through the aorta. The only place where oxygenated blood would come *to* the heart is from the lungs. Since it goes to the heart, it must be a vein. So the answer is the pulmonary veins.
