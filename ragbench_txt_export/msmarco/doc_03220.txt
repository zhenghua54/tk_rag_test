Littering is a very frequent form of environmental pollution and a clear sign that our society still has to learn a lot when it comes to a global environmental conscience. Many litter items are not biodegradable which means that their chemical decomposition takes a very long time and these items can therefore create long-term damage to environment (as this is the case with cigarette butts).
