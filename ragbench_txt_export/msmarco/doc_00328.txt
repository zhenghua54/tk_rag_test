The cost to change a Ford Escape fuel filter will depend on the  year of the vehicle. The part can cost from $15 to $35 or more.  Labor will be added to this amount unless a â€¦ person does it  themselves. Answers Publisher. I just changed the air filter and cabin filter in my 08 Honda Fit in about 4 minutes (and it was the first time I have ever done it myself). The dealership wanted $60 to replace my cabin filter alone.
