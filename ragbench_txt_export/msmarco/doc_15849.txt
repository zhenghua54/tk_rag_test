up vote 7 down vote. Carbon dioxide is neither organic nor inorganic, it's just carbon dioxide. This distinction is nothing but a convention to separate things between the textbooks and professors. Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in water and the usual salts. This was/is reason to think of it as inorganic. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, phosgene, carbonic acid are inorganic. Ethylene carbonate, vinylene carbonate, oxalic acid, formic acid, dichloroacetylene are organic. Aluminum carbide, $\ce{Al4C3}$, is inorganic (hydrolyzes to methane).
