Hi friend,There is no maximum limit for drinking water. It depends upon our life style. But minimum a person should drink 4 to 5 litres of water per day. If we take more water the waste particles can be thrown out easily through urination. If we do not drink much water the wastage will be stored in the body itself. The acidity problem increases, when we take less water.
