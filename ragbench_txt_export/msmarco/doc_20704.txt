Workshop. Another fast way to become a personal trainer is to take an in-person workshop where you will be taught what you need to know to become a personal trainer. These workshops typically last three days, at the end of which you will be required to write an exam to become certified. An average training program takes around 6 months to complete. Many gyms and fitness clubs are now accepting a College or University degree in a fitness related field instead of requiring you to become certified. These take from two years for a diploma to over four for a bachelors degree.
