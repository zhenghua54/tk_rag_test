Introduction Chestnuts have been cultivated for nuts and wood for thousands of years. The name Castanea is believed to come from Kastanea, a city in Pontus, Turkey. European chestnuts (Castanea sativa) probably survived the ice age in Southern Russia in the Caucasus Mountains, between the Black and the Caspian Seas. Chestnuts are also important in Asia, where there are four native species (Castanea mollissima, C. henryi, C. seguinii, and C. crenata). In North America, pollen records from the last interglacial period show that American chestnut trees, Castanea dentata, were present on Long Island 30,000 to 50,000 years ago.
