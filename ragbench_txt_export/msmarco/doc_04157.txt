Stroma Function. Most of the enzymes essential in the process of photosynthesis are normally embedded in the stroma and in the thylakoid membranes. The stroma is the fluid-filled space that is surrounding the grana, and is also involved in the synthesis of organic molecules from water and carbon dioxide. After the thylakoids, the process of producing starch or sugar moves out to the stroma.
