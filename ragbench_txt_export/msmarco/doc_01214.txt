“ Diastasis recti ” means your belly sticks out because the space between your left and right belly muscles has widened. You might call it a “pooch.”. It's very common among pregnant women. About two-thirds of pregnant women have it. Recti refers to your ab muscles called the rectus abdominis.. When the ab muscles move aside like this, the uterus, bowels, and other organs have only a thin band of connective tissue in front to hold them in place.
