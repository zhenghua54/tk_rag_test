Reaction with oxygen. Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide. Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulphur. Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide: carbon + oxygen → carbon dioxide. sulphur + oxygen → sulphur dioxide. Non-metal oxides such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for acid rain. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife.
