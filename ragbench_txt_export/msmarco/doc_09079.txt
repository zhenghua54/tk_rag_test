Best Answer: All of the cruise lines, except Carnival, require that at least one person in each cabin be age 21 or older. Carnival requires that at least one person be age 25 or older. All of the cruise lines are concerned that there is a responsible adult (age 21 or 25) to supervise anyone under that age. In addition, all cruise line cabins are sold based on double occupancy (two people per cabin). You can still cruise alone if you are age 21 but you will have to pay a single supplement to occupy that cabin alone. The single supplement is essentially a double fare; same as if two people were in the cabin. So if you see a fare that $599 for a 7-day cruise that's for each of the two people.
