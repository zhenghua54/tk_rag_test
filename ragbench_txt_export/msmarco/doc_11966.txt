A habitat is made up of physical factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and availability of light as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and the presence of predators. A habitat is not necessarily a geographic areaâ€”for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a cell within the host's body.
