Elimination. Use the process of elimination if you think your neck itchiness is caused by an allergic reaction. If the itchiness cropped up suddenly after using a new cosmetic, hair dye, skin lotion, shampoo, soap, detergent or perfume, stop using that particular product. Your neck can itch as a result of an allergic reaction to perfume, soaps, food, medication, cosmetics or jewelry, as well as insect bites, lice, sunburn, sunspots and even herpes zoster.
