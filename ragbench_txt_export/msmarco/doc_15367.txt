Report Abuse. Clavamox will help if the problem is due to a bacterial infection. However, for eye problems, it is usually used in conjunction with a topical eye medication. I would really recommend taking your cat to the vet. Eye infections can get really bad if left untreated. If you can't afford to take your cat to the vet, treating it with clavamox is certainly better then doing nothing.
