The Lewis theory of acids and bases is more general than the one sided nature of the Bronsted-Lowry theory. Keep in mind that Bronsted-Lowry, which defines an acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor, REQUIRES the presence of a solvent, specifically a protic solvent, of which water is the usual example. The Lewis definitions of acid and base do not have the constraints that the Bronsted-Lowry theory does and, as we shall see, many more reactions were seen to be acid base in nature using the Lewis definition than when using the Bronsted-Lowry definitions. II. The Acid Base Theory. The modern way to define a Lewis acid and base is a bit more concise than above: 1  Acid: an electron acceptor. 2  Base: an electron donor
