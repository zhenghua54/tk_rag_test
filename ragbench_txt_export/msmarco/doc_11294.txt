Unlike most coasters, the biggest drop on this ride is not the first but the second--a whopping 230 feet, reaching speeds of 85 mph. When you need a break from riding, check out one of the awesome shows playing on Kennywood’s stages! From rocking out to tunes of yesteryear, to enjoying a modern twist on a classic fairy tale, Kennywood’s shows have something for everyone! See the weekly show schedule here.
