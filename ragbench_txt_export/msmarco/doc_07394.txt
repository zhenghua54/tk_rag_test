Bathroom Fan Installation Costs. The following prices are based on national averages; expect costs to be slightly higher or lower depending on the state in which you reside. 1  Bathroom fans themselves cost anywhere from $30-$300. 2  Ultra-quiet combination units with a light and/or heater will be on the more expensive end of the spectrum. 1 If the bathroom is located on the second floor (in a 2 story home) far from an exterior wall, labor costs will be cheaper to go into the attic and up through the roof. 2  The effectiveness of drawing air from the outside with the fan in this case will be much more difficult, however.
