New Zealand is a westernised first-world country, located 1250 miles southeast of Australia, in the south-western Pacific Ocean. It is made up of two main islands and a number â€¦ of smaller ones. The indigenous people of New Zealand settled around 1000 years ago; they are called the Maori, who named the islands Aotearoa. The country was founded by the Treaty of Waitangi between Maori and Pakeha (non-Maori, represented by the British Crown) which was signed on the 4th of February, 1840.
