The Sumatran rhinoceros is considered the least derived of the extant species, as it shares more traits with its Miocene ancestors. Paleontological evidence in the fossil record dates the genus Dicerorhinus to the Early Miocene, 23â€“16 million years ago. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt, and one of the Sumatran populations may already be extinct. Total numbers today may be as low as 80. In 2015, researchers announced that the Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros is extinct from north part of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia).
