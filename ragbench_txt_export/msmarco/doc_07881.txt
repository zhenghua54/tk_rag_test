Another oddity among turkeys is the phenomena where a Hen will actually develop a beard. This is also fairly rare but can be found in up to 20% of the Hens in some populations. I have found it to be more rare than that in my travels. By the next spring he will be a 2 year old and sport a beard up to 9-10″. Beards over 10″ are typically found on birds of 3 years or older though few toms will grow a beard longer than 11-11 1/2″. A Wide Eastern (left), Thin Osceola (right). 1  Non-Typical Turkeys!
