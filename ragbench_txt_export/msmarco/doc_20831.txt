John also said that the transmission has a output speed sensor that is not used on the Hummer because we get the output speed from the T-case. This sensor is the same as the input speed sensor, which can be used as a spare in case the input speed sensor fails. John says the failure of the input speed sensor is very unlikely. Fortunately maintaining the Output speed sensor is very easy.
