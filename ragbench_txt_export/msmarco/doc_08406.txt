CONCLUSION: Compared with an initial TAUS screen, universal transvaginal ultrasound was a more cost-effective strategy under most assumptions. Optimizing TAUS testing characteristics or applying a transabdominal screening strategy in lower risk populations may yield an initial TAUS to be cost-effective. In comparison to TAUS, universal transvaginal CL screening reduced preterm birth by 0.03%, reduced costs by $1.2 million and increased quality-adjusted life years by 70 per 100,000 women.
