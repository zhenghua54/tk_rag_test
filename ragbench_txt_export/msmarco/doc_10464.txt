The three types of gland are all located in gastric pits within the gastric mucosa â€“the mucous membrane of the stomach. The gastric mucosa is pitted with innumerable gastric pits which house the gastric glands. The cardiac glands are found in the cardia of the stomach which is the part nearest to the heart, enclosing the opening where the oesophagus joins to the stomach. Only cardiac glands are found here and they primarily secrete mucus.
