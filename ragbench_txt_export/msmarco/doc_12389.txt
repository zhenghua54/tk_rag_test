Factory Invoice. The factory invoice is the total cost to the dealer for a vehicle. This price is the sum of the base invoice or cost for the base model of the car, plus the cost of options, destination fees and manufacturer fees. The dealer invoice is the price the manufacturer bills the dealer for the vehicles they purchase, plus any options equipped. This is in essence the dealer's cost, and is not generally shared with the customer.
