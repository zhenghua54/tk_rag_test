The Finnish sauna (pronounced originally in Finnish [ˈsɑunɑ], although english often use something like 'sow-nah') is a substantial part of Finnish culture. There are five million inhabitants and over three million saunas in Finland-an average of one per household. The wood stove sauna is the most common type of sauna outside of the city areas, where the electric sauna is more common. The metal stove with stones on top (kiuas) is heated with birch wood fire, and this heats the sauna room to the required temperature.
