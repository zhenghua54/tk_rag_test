Granite is an igneous rock composed of mostly two minerals: quartz and feldspar. It is an intrusive rock, meaning that it crystallized from magma that cooled far below the earth's surface. Its name is derived from the Latin word 'granum', which means 'grain', a reference to the easily-seen minerals in the rock. When that happens, the granite is called a pegmatite. The overall color of granite depends largely on the kind of feldspar in the rock. Potassium-rich feldspar tends to be some shade of red or pinkish-tan, so a lot of granite is similarly red or pink.
