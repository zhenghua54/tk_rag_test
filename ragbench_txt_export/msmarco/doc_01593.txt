Cytoplasm. The cytoplasm refers to the entire area of the cell outside of the nucleus. The cytoplasm has two parts, the organelles and the cytosol, a grayish gel-like liquid that fills the interior of the cell. The cytosol provides a home for the nucleus and organelles as well as a location for protein synthesis and other fundamental chemical reactions. Floating in the cytoplasm are the many membrane-bound organelles, each with a distinct structure and an important function in the processes of the cell. Nucleus: stores the cellâ€™s genetic material in strands of DNA and choreographs life functions by sending detailed messages to the rest
