BACK. Radionics is an advanced complementary therapy in which the practitioner uses pendulum dowsing (a form of Radiesthesia) in combination with Radionic instruments to discover and correct what are termed 'energy imbalances' in the patient. Many Radionic practitioners work remotely from their patients, who may be located anywhere in the world. The patient supplies a small sample of hair and describes their symptoms. From this the practitioner is able to build up an analysis, which in turn leads to treatment procedures.
