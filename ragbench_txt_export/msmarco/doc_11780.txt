Temperature taken under the arm usually is considered to be less accurate than most other body locations for measuring temperature. This measurement, also known as axillary temperature, tends to be about half a degree to a degree below oral temperature. Ear temperature (or tympanic temperature) also is very accurate in children and adults. 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees Celsius) is the normal temperature for this method. Measuring body temperature orally is perhaps the most traditional means of measurement.
