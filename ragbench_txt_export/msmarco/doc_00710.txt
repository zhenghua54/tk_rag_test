A Pure breed AKC German Shephed from a Pro Breeder that Shows, and the puppy is Show Quality will cost you around $2500. They come with Guarantees and These breeders stand by there dogs and give Lifetime Support ! Some Show breeders do NOT OFA there stock. The range varies from say, $50-$2000. Frankly I want a breeder who knows what the hell they are doing and know their genetics. If I was just interested in not showing, I would go to the shelter and save one there, because you can find alot of purebreds there. Also go thru German Shepherd rescue.
