Given all the various options on aluminum gutters, they will cost you roughly $750 – $2,300 for a 150 foot project, depending on the size of gutter, gauge and attachment method you choose for your home. Steel Gutters and Downspout Costs: $16-$25 per linear foot. Vinyl Gutters and Downspout Cost: $1 to $3 per linear foot. Vinyl is the least expensive material on the market, and the easiest to work with, making it a good fit for “do-it-yourself” (DIY) projects. The knock on vinyl is durability, as it weakens faster than other materials, especially in cold climates.
