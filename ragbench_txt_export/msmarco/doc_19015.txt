Whereas the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is responsible for making interest rate decisions based on changes in the macroeconomic environment, the FPC is more of a regulatory body for the City. The committee, housed in the Bank of England (BoE) and chaired by the Bank's governor Mervyn King, is viewed as a counterpart to the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates. The FPC will be part of the BoE and staffed with six BoE executives, the head of the new regulator and four external members.
