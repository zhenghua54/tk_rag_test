Desert Rose Plant Care. Botanical Name: Adenium obesum. Desert rose plant is so easy to care for, it's a wonder why we don't see these beautiful succulents more often in nurseries and florist's shops. Desert rose branches naturally, creating an attractive treelike house plant. Its succulent stems are covered top to bottom with long, evergreen leaves.
