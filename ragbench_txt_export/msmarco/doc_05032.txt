Similar to pollen, spores are created from a select number of fertile cells held in the sporangium and covered by a protective layer of inert cells. These fertile, or sporogenous cells eventually develop into mother spore cells. Each mother cell creates 4 separate spore cells. Spores are a type of haploid, a unique type of cell structure produced by certain kinds of plants as a means of reproduction. Spores are usually unicellular, measuring between 4 and 20 micrometers in size.
