Andre Smith, Alabama (6-4, 332), arm length: 35 5/8 inches. Although Smith is a bit short for the position by NFL standards, his length more than makes up for his height. Smith actually plays more like a tackle who is 6-8. He’s raw from a technique standpoint, and longer arms could help him make up for his consistent false steps and missed assignments. However, 33½ is right around the average length for an NFL starter and is more than enough for Oher to get by. Eben Britton, Arizona (6-6, 309), arm length: 32½ inches. Britton’s lack of length is a concern for me, especially if teams are looking at him as a left tackle prospect
