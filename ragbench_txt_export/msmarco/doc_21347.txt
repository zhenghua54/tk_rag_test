The best source of medium chain triglycerides is coconut oil. Coconuts, like most nuts, contain significant amounts of fat, but unlike other nuts, which contain mostly monounsaturated fat, the fat provided by coconuts is almost all in the form of health-promoting medium chain triglycerides (MCTs). Researchers concluded that long-term substitution of medium chain triglycerides for long chain triglycerides [MCT for LCT] would produce weight loss if energy intake remained constant.. So if you simply substitute coconut oil for sources of LCTs in your diet, you are going to lose weight.
