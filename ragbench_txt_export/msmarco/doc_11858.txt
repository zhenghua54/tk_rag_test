Stable subduction zones involve the oceanic lithosphere of one plate sliding beneath the continental lithosphere or oceanic lithosphere of another plate due to the higher density of the oceanic lithosphere. Subduction zones dive down into the mantle beneath 55,000 kilometres of convergent plate margins (Lallemand, 1999), almost equal to the cumulative 60,000 kilometres of mid-ocean ridges.
