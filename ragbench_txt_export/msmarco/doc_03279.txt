Total Fiber Needs. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine assembled an adequate intake, or AI, for total fiber. Adult men should get 30 to 38 grams of fiber each day, while adult women need 21 to 25 grams. During pregnancy and while nursing, however, you should get 28 to 29 grams of total fiber daily. This basic recommendation may be too much or too little, depending on your diet.
