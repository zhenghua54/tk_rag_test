From wikipedia: The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code). The most common reason for wanting to transform source code is to create an executable program. So how does IDEs like Code::Blocks or Dev-C++ compile your code? They use compilers. Code::Blocks uses MinGW Compiler which is a port of the GCC set of compilers. Dev-C++ uses that same compiler too but the version may vary.
