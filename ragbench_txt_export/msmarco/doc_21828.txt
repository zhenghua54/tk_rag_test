If you enjoyed the Truly Triangular Scarf, then try your hand at this one. With one small change to the pattern, you get a longer, narrower scarf. In this pattern, the same number of stitches are cast on and bound off. The same amount of yarn is used. Remember to weigh your yarn before you begin and periodically while working the increase section.
