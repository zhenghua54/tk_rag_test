Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD. Nov. 1, 2012 (Boston) -- A pricey new treatment for prostate cancer called proton beam therapy appears to cause slightly less diarrhea, bloating, and cramping than traditional radiation treatments. But the effect is short-lived, a new study suggests. Patients say proton beam therapy sounds so much better, they want it no matter what the cost, says Colleen Lawton, MD, a radiation oncologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center in Milwaukee.
