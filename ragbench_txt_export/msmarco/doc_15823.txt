Cattail; a common and useful native plant. Cattails are one of the most common and easily identified of our water-loving plants. Most people are familiar with the long green leaves and hot-dog shaped brown flower spikes of our common native cattail, Typha latifolia. It is found growing in dense stands in areas with shallow water or seasonal flooding, or as a narrow band along the margins of deeper water. It is a widespread plant, found throughout most of North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Washington also harbors another cattail species, Typha angustifolia, or narrow leaf cattail. It is an invader from other parts of the country, and so far is only known from a couple of locations.
