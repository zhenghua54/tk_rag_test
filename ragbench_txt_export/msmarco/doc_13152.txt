Patients typically complain of an irritation, sometimes gritty, sometimes burning, often w/purulent discharge such that their lids are glued shut in the morning & crusted over. Get help from a doctor now â€º. Depends: Assuming the pink eye is caused by a viral infection (most likely), the time from contracting the virus to showing symptoms can be anywhere from 4-10 days. If it was a bacterial infection, symptoms usually being sooner.
