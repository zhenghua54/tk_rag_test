They are haploid cells that, when fused during sexual reproduction with a male gamete (sperm), form a zygote. Let's break this down a little more. During sexual reproduction, two cells-one from a female organism and one from a male organism-fuse together to create a zygote, a fertilized cell. One gamete comes from the female, and one comes from the male. Female gametes are also called eggs or ova. Female gametes are also called eggs or ova. They are created during the cellular reproduction process known as meiosis.
