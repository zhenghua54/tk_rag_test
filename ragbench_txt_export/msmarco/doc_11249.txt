Cobra (/ˈkōbrə/ pronunciation (help·info)) is the Portuguese word for  snake . In English and in some other languages, it has been adopted as the name for any of various species of venomous snakes. Most of those species are in the family Elapidae, all of which are venomous. The name cobra is short for cobra de capelo or cobra-de-capelo, which is Portuguese for snake with hood, or hood-snake. In some modern languages, such as Afrikaans, the other part of the Portuguese name was adopted, and the predominant name for a cobra in Afrikaans is kapel.
