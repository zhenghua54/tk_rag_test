Proton-beam therapy is a controversial alternative to conventional radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients; opponents say that evidence supporting its use just isn't there. However, a new study shows extremely high efficacy in 5-year outcomes for patients in all risk categories treated with proton-beam therapy. Proton-beam therapy is not new, but its use for medicinal purposes has greatly increased during the past decade. Much of the controversy related to this treatment arose because of cost. The cost to construct and equip a facility to provide proton-beam therapy ranges from $25 million to $150 million.
