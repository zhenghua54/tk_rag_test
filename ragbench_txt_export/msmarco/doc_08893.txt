Recommended Lift: Invacare Manual or Power Lift All of the Invacare Lifts are built with wheels large enough to maneuver easily on thick carpeting. Recommended Lift: Advance Power Lift Substantial enough to transfer a 340-pound patient yet nimble enough to fold for storage or disassemble quickly for transport. These patient lifts are designed to bear a safe working load of a minimum of 400lb, with some models capable of lifting up to 700lb. These heavy duty/high weight patient lifts feature all the same benefits and options as the power patient lifts, just with the added weight support.
