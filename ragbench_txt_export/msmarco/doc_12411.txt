The Stube Sauna is built with local wood and is the symbol of Tyrolean tradition: the infusions of natural aromas stimulate circulation, promote the expulsion of toxins and, at the same time, produce a healing effect on the skin and respiratory system. WITH SALT WATER. The Spa’s steam bath is ideal to purify yourself from toxins, since the lower temperatures than the sauna (42°c) with high humidity (90%) are a real panacea for health for all ages; with the refreshing effect of mint combined with thermal heat, you’ll feel completely purified.
