OK, here is the real and absolute answer. Theodore Roosevelt did not INVENT the Teddy Bear Morris Midton did. Roosevelt inspired to make the Teddy Bear. In fact, his very own nickname was Teddy because back when he was president, he went hunting one day (I think he was on a horse using a rifle) and saw a bear. Then, he aimed his fully loaded rifle (if he was using a rifle that was fully loaded) directly at the bear. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States, is the person responsible for giving the teddy bear his name. On November 14, 1902, Roosevelt was helping â€¦ settle a border dispute between Mississippi and Louisiana.
