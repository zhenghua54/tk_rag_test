Interpreters languages like Perl, or even Interpreter programs like the browser your using to view the forums, allows human readible programming to be executed. However Interpreting code thats human readible is Slow, and in most interpreters I know of it works on the basis of Line by Line. Java has a compiler which compiles source into byte code. This can be run on a virtual machine(which can be seen as an interpreter) or a machine whose machine language is bytecode, eg. picojava chips. The third option is a just in time(JIT) compiler which compiles java to native code. Voodoo Child, Jun 18, 2004. #6.
