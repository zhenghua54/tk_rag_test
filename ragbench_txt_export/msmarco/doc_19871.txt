Here are our different types of plants, as they are sorted on Discover Plants. You may notice some categories are not actually scientific, or botanical, classifications. For example, the term 'vegetables' is only a culinary term, not an actual plant type. Same for 'fruits', but to a lesser extent. We have separated our types of plants by how people commonly refer to them.
