The first time my son got croup, we took him to the ER and I was very scared. He was a little better by the time we got to the ER, which they said was due to the fresh air he got going in and out of the car. It is scary at first, but knowing what helps makes a big difference. Once she's exposed, it's probably too late. My daughter suffered from croup for years, she was very susceptible to it. If your daughter wakes up with an awful barking cough unlike nothing you've ever heard before, that's croup. Steam up your bathroom and take her in to let her breathe the air.
