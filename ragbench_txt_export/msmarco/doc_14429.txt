The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched a public research consortium named ENCODE, the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements, in September 2003, to carry out a project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence. The APPRIS server has been used in the context of the scale up of the ENCODE project to annotate the Human genome but APPRIS is being used for other species (e.g. mouse, rat and zebrafish). The pipeline is made up of separate modules that combine protein structure and function information and evolutionary evidence.
