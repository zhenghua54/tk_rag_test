That does not mean that you will lose your Social Security Disability if you earn $720 one month and never earn another penny again, but if you begin to earn $720 a month or more on a regular basis, you need to know that your Social Security Disability benefits are not going to continue after a certain amount of time. First and foremost, you need to understand that you can earn up to $720 per month without it affecting your disability benefits whatsoever. If your income exceeds $720 per month, however, it could have an impact on your benefits over time.
