Printmaking is an indirect means of creating art by transferring an image or design by contact with a matrix such as a block, plate, stone, or screen. There are many different types of printmaking, just as there are many types of paints. An artist chooses the medium based on the effect he/she is looking to achieve. Printmaking is considered an original art form because it is done completely by hand.
