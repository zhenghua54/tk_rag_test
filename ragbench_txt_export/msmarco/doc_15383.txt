The gel is applied to the teeth via one-size-fits-all trays, whitening strips or paint-on applicators. In many cases this may only whiten a few of the front teeth unlike custom trays that can whiten the entire smile. Over-the-counter teeth whitening cost: $20 to $100. Whether in the form of one-hour bleaching sessions at your dentist's office, or home-use bleaching kits purchased at your local drugstore, teeth whitening solutions abound.
