1 Day. 3-5 Days. Of course, all foods last for a shorter period of time if they are not stored properly. But remember, watermelon, like a lot of other fresh fruits, usually does not have a use by date or a best before date so you will have to use the date purchased or date picked. There is rarely a picnic that does not include a watermelon. Its sweet, juicy red flesh has plenty of Vitamins A & C and the anti-oxident lycopene which is good for heart and bone health. It has no fat and is very low in calories as it is comprised of 90% water and 8% natural sugar.
