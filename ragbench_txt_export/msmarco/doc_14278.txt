Painted turtles are similar in behavior to the sliders and cooters. They make fine community turtles and get along very well with Map turtles, Sliders, Cooters, and Red Bellies. Southern Painted Turtles are less cold tolerant, all the painted turtles make wonderful pets as they are small, hardy, and become quite tame in captivity. Their enclosure should be similar to that described for the Sliders but additional live plants can be added to keep these turtles feeling a bit more secure. They will feed on a wide variety of insects, insect larvae, and fish. Adult Painted turtles do very well in outdoor ponds.
