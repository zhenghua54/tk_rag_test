But the average salary of $200,000 in New Zealand is in line with other major nations. According to the Australian Rugby Players' Association, the annual salary of a Super 14 player in Australia last year was A$202,000 ($230,000). In France, the average wage of professional players is ¬12,000 per month, which is ¬144,000 a year or $266,000. In England, Premier League footballers can expect an average salary of £656,000 ($1.51 million) but even that is dwarfed by the colossal $6.6 million which is the average salary paid to professional basketballers in America's NBA.
