This is going to change. This piece of glass combined with reflective film is what makes the infinity mirror work. Make sure that you clean each side of the glass as best you can. Choose a side to work with. Place the sheet of reflective film on a flat surface and then place the pane of glass on top of it. Use the marker to draw an outline of the glass and then trim within the lines on the reflective film.
