A nursing diploma program is not the only express route to starting one’s career in nursing. The associate’s degree in nursing or ADN is another entry-level nursing degree that can lead to a license as a registered nurse. An associates degree in nursing meets all requirements for a higher nursing education so you have the flexibility to pursue a BSN degree if you want. The nursing diploma program, on the other hand, does not. This difference is particularly important if you have plans in advancing your degree in the future.
