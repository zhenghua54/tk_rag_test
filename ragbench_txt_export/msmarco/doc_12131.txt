An aquiline nose (also called a Roman nose or hook nose) is a human nose with a prominent bridge, giving it the appearance of being curved or slightly bent. The word aquiline comes from the Latin word aquilinus (eagle-like), an allusion to the curved beak of an eagle. The flat, broad nose is ubiquitous among most populations in Africa, and is noted by nineteenth-century writers and travelers (such as Colin Mackenzie) as a mark of  Negroid  ancestry. It stands in opposition to the narrow aquiline, straight or convex noses (lepthorrine), which are instead deemed  Caucasian .
