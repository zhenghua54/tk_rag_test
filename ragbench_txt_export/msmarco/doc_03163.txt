A survey by the National Association of Social Workers found that practice area had a direct impact on earnings. In 2010, child and family case workers made anywhere from $42,400 to $72,000 a year. The median, however, was closer to $55,000. Those working with adolescent welfare earned a median of $50,000 a year. School social work, on the other hand, commanded a salary of $62,000 a year. While $7,000 more than a child and family case worker, itâ€™s still not the highest income for the occupation. Administrators were the highest paid for the industry, earning $78,000 a year. As with any job, employers affect salaries, and a case worker is no exception. Those working directly for social services, where many welfare case workers are employed, earned a median of $53,000 a year; while those working for other government agencies made $66,300 a year.
