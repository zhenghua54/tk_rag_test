Whether it is cooked in the crockpot or in a big saucepan in the kitchen, there is no better kiwiana meat treat than pickled pork. If you do choose the slow cooked version, cook longer with golden syrup and bay leaves. To make Pickled Pork, you will need: 1 kg pickled pork. Stud the pork with the cloves. Place in a deep saucepan with a lid. Add all remaining ingredients and water until pork just covered. Bring to the boil, cover tightly with lid and simmer gently â€“ allow 1 hour per kilogram.
