Although your body needs only small amounts of iodine, its role in your body is anything but small. Iodine is critical for the production of your thyroid hormone, which has many important roles. Iodine may have other key roles in the body, although these are not yet fully understood. Your thyroid gland produces two hormones, triiodothyronine, or T3, and thyroxine, or T4. According to the Institute of Medicine, iodine makes up about 59 percent of T3 and 65 percent of T4 by weight.
