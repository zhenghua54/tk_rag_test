Salt marshes contain abundant organic matter, which is the source of energy. The mud in the marsh is anoxic because other bacteria quickly consume dissolved oxygen to respire (burn) the abundant organic matter. Groundwater discharge and surface runoff into the marsh provides nitrate. They can smell bad because of the release of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg gas). They often breed undesirable organisms like mosquitoes. They consume prime waterfront real estate. They release greenhouse gasses like methane and nitrous oxide.
