Social constructionism or the social construction of reality (also social concept) is a theory of knowledge in sociology and communication theory that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. Hacking suggests that this third part of the analysis, the interaction between a socially constructed category and the individuals that are actually or potentially included in that category, is present in many social construction analyses involving types of human beings.
