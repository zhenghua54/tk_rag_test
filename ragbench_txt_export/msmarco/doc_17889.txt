A complete blood count (CBC) gives important information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood, especially red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A CBC helps your doctor check any symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, or bruising, you may have. A CBC also helps him or her diagnose conditions, such as anemia, infection, and many other disorders. A CBC test usually includes: 1  White blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count. 2  White blood cells protect the body against infection. 3  If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it. 4  White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells but fewer in number. 1 White blood cell types (WBC differential). 2  The major types of white blood cells are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. 3  Immature neutrophils, called band neutrophils, are also part of this test. 4  Each type of cell plays a different role in protecting the body.
