More Information about Bouvardia. The genus Bouvardia contains around 49 species that are native to the tropical Americas. Bouvardia species are herbaceous perennials between 1' and 4' tall that produce attractive clusters of tubular flowers at the tips of the branches in shades of red, pink, yellow, and white. Even if you are not familiar with bouvardia, you may have seen them as fragrant cut-flowers that can last a week or more in a vase. In the language of flowers, bouvardia represents enthusiasm or zest for life. Bouvardia is also sold as a long-blooming house plant. The bright colors and tubular shape of Bouvardia flowers attract butterflies and hummingbirds (enthusiastic ones, I presume) to the garden
