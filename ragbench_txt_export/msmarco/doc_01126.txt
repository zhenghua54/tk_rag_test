This page explains what esters are and looks at their simple physical properties such as solubility and boiling points. It includes an introduction to more complicated naturally-occurring esters like animal and vegetable fats and oils. Animal and vegetable fats and oils are just big complicated esters. The difference between a fat (like butter) and an oil (like sunflower oil) is simply in the melting points of the mixture of esters they contain. If the melting points are below room temperature, it will be a liquid-an oil.
