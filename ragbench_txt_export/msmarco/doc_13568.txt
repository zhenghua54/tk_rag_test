Light travels through space at just over 186,000 miles per second. The moon is just under 250,000 miles from Earth, so light from the Moon's surface has to travel more than one second (about 1.3 seconds) to reach us. Among other things, the astronauts left reflecting mirrors on the moon. Since moonlight is reflected sunlight, it originates at the Sun's surface 93 million miles from the Earth/Moon system. It takes about 8 minutes for that trip, so the short, final hop from the Moon to the Earth is trivial by comparison.
