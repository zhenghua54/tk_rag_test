Thatâ€™s based on brokers getting an average payout of 30 percent to 40 percent on all commissions. To get to such a commission level selling mutual funds with a 5.75 percent sales charge or load would require total monthly sales of more than $230,000. For stock trading, the total would need to be even higher. The broker ranks are projected to increase by 30 percent through 2018, a much faster than average rate according, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Financial advisors earn median annual compensation of about $90,000, also well above average for college graduates, says Payscale.com.
