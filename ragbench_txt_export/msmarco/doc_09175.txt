Overview. Mastic is a sticky substance derived from the Pistacia lentiscus tree, also called Chios mastic. This tree grows naturally in North Africa and countries on the eastern side of the Mediterranean sea. As a supplement, mastic is available in capsules or can be chewed as a gum. People have traditionally chewed mastic gum to relieve digestive upset, according to physician and medical writer, Dr. Andrew Weil. It may ease gastritis and upset stomach, and decrease inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.
