I have a little facial hair now on my side burn area to my chin and some on my neck. And I shave usually 1-2 times a week. Does this usually mean that I stopped growing and have reached close to my peak height. Also I am 15 and am 6 foot 2. My dad is 5 foot 10 and my mom is 5 foot 3. Im not asking about how to grow taller, I just want to know your guys opinion if facial hair means Im done growing.
