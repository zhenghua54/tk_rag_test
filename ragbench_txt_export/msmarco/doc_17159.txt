Fetzer s German Brand Sausages are authentic Old World recipe sausages produced using the freshest, leanest, hand crafted all natural meats, and the finest ingredients available. We use Carlton Farms meat exclusively, which is truly Fresh and Natural. Since 1880 they have been using the same old world recipes created by Eugen Fetzer s grandfather. They are still in use today. Eugen and Marianne Fetzer produced their famous sausage in Germany for 25 years until they came to the United States in 1978.
