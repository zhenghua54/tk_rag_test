While some have ascribed the aquiline nose to specific ethnic, racial, or geographic groups, and in some cases associated it with other supposed non-physical characteristics (i.e. intelligence, status, personality, etc., see below), no scientific studies or evidence support any such linkage. The flat, broad nose is ubiquitous among most populations in Africa, and is noted by nineteenth-century writers and travelers (such as Colin Mackenzie) as a mark of  Negroid  ancestry. It stands in opposition to the narrow aquiline, straight or convex noses (lepthorrine), which are instead deemed  Caucasian .
