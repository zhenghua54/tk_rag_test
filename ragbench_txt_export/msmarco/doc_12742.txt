Content-agnostic: Roku's interface doesn't push you toward one app or service. The platform has a refreshing come one, come all vibe that seems more customer-friendly than Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV or Android TV, which all more or less push you toward the hardware makers' own content. For bargain hunters the cheaper Roku Streaming Stick is nearly as good, and the Google Chromecast is so cheap it's almost an impulse purchase. Meanwhile Apple TV and Fire TV have plenty of good points, particularly if you've already bought a lot of music, movies or TV shows from Apple or Amazon.
