With a pork tenderloin: Season the meat, sear all sides in a very hot pan, and then finish in the oven at 350째F (175째C) degrees until the internal temp. hits 145째F (63째C). Then let it sit for 10 minutes, and cut 'er up. If you need it done faster, a higher oven temp will accomplish this, but may compromise quality. I always season my pork tenderloins, then pan-sear for a crispy brown outer crust, then put into the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes to one hour. At 45 minutes, I begin checking the internal temperature of the meat.
