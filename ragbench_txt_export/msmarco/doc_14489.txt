The main advantage to a pool remodel is to revamp the look of the pool and backyard area without having to replace the existing pool. While this can't be done with all pools, most homeowner want to keep the project as cost effective as possible. Pool remodels can save the homeowner thousands of dollars. If the pool is inground or above ground and has a liner, the cost of the liner as well as any pool additions or features such as a waterfall, table or stairs will have to be added to the final cost estimate.
