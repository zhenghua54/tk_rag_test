During March, April and May, Venice warms up quickly after its winter. Temperatures rise from a chilly 8°C in March to 17 or 18°C on average by the end of May, although nights are always cooler. Spring is a little rainy at times, with between 5-8 days of rain a month, but it's nothing an umbrella can't cope with.
