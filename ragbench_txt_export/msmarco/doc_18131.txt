A defined contribution (DC) plan is a type of retirement plan in which the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis. For example, the number of defined contribution plans in the US has been steadily increasing, as more and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.
