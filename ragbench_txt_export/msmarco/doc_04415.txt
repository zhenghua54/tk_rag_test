Advertisement. For a startup, producing a video advertisement is one of the boldest ways to announce your presence to a wide audience. In no more than a couple of minutes, a cleverly executed spot can explain what your business does and galvanize viewers in a way static ads can't. If you're not funny, don't make a jokey video. Many videos go viral due to a smart, well-timed joke, so it's tempting to come up with a funny concept for your ad or at least try to inject some humor into it.
