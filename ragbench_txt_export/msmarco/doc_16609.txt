Frequently Asked Questions. In 1968 the average cost of attending farrier school was $2400. The average cost to shoe a horse was $12 a head. At that price, a graduate would have to shoe 200 horses to pay for his/her schooling. Currently, our tuition is $8000. The average cost to shoe a horse is anywhere from $65 - $150 a head. If we figure low at $80 a head (which our graduates should be able to get in all but the most rural or economically depressed parts of the country), a graduate would have to shoe only 100 horses to pay for his/her schooling.
