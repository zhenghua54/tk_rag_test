Anzac Day is a national pubic holiday in Australia and New Zealand, and is commemorated by both countries on 25 April every year to honour members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who fought at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War 1. The day was originally a day of remembrance for the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who landed at Gallipoli on the 25th of April, 1915. The day commemorates the bravery and sacrifice of the thousands of men who died during the eight-month occupation of Gallipoli.
