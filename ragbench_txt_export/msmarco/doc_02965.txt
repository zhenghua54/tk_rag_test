Size of the human stomach varies significantly in adults, with one study showing areas ranging from 520 cm 3 (32 cu in) to 1,536 cm 3 (93.7 cu in) and weights ranging from 77 grams (2.7 oz) to 453 grams (16.0 oz). Anthropometric measurements also have uses in epidemiology and medical anthropology, for example in helping to determine the relationship between various body measurements (height, weight, percentage body fat, etc.) and medical outcomes.
