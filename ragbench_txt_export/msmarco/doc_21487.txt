You have rated this. About the Drink. Tizer is a red fizzy drink made by Barr (the makers of Irn Bru) from Scotland. The drink was first made in 1924 by Fred Pickup of Manchester when it was known as ‘Pickup’s Appetizer’ and was eventually sold to Irn Bru in 1972 for £2.5 million. But then they changed it to the tizer we have nowadays. It now tastes disgusting and leaves a horrible feeling in your throat. I’m 18, I’ve still got along time ahead of me to see the old tizer maybe return one day. It was my favourite pop of all time.
