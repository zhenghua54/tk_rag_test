When an airfoil (or a wing) is moving relative to the air it generates an aerodynamic force, in a rearward direction at an angle with the direction of relative motion. This aerodynamic force is commonly resolved into two components 1  : drag is the force component parallel to the direction of relative motion, Forces on an aerofoil. Aerodynamic force is exerted on a body by the air (or some other gas) in which the body is immersed, and is due to the relative motion between the body and the gas. Aerodynamic force arises from two causes: 1  the normal force due to the pressure on the surface of the body.
