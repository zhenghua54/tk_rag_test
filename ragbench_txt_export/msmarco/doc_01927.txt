SQAS is a standardised assessment to evaluate the quality, safety, security and environmental performance of logistics service providers and chemical distributors centrally managed by Cefic. An SQAS assessment offers a detailed factual and objective report, which each chemical company needs to evaluate according to its own requirements. It shows the LSP the areas for improvement and offers a guideline towards these improvements.
