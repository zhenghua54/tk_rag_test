Often, joints such as the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists are affected. Enteropathic arthritis is a form of arthritis (joint inflammation) associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) -- the two most common being Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Most of these people will develop arthritis within the knees, hips, ankles, elbows, or wrists. These are known as peripheral joints. About 5 percent will develop the condition in the spine. Males and females are equally likely to develop enteropathic arthritis. It is more common in teenagers and young adults.
