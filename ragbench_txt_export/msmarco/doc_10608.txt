Manglik/Kuja Dosha In Vedic Astrology. Mars has a special place in vedic astrology when it comes to marital affairs. Manglik or Kuja dosha is one of the most dreaded dosha in the vedic chart. A number of people get married late because of this dosha as it takes them a long time to find the match (who also have the same dosha).
