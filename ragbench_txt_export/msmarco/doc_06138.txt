The platypus is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom. Platypuses (which is the correct plural form, not platypi) have a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver; a sleek, furry body like an otter; and a flat bill and webbed feet like a duck. In fact, the first time a platypus was brought from Australia to Britain, people couldn't believe that it was a real animal.
