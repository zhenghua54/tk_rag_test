The normal body temperature for a dog falls within the range of 100°F to 102.5°F (about 38°C to 39.2°C). If your dog's temperature is outside of this range, you should contact your veterinarian. Body temperature over 104°F or under 99°F indicates an emergency situation. In general, the most accurate way to measure a dog's body temperature is rectally.
