Lipases are a general class of enzymes that break down fat molecules. Fats, also called lipids, exist in many forms; different kinds of fats require different lipases to break them down.

When you eat foods that contain fat, the fats pass through the stomach undigested into the small intestine, explains Dr. Lauralee Sherwood in her book Human Physiology..
