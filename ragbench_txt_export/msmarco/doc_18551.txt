For these and other reasons, scleral contact lenses can cost significantly more than standard contacts; in fact, it is not uncommon for scleral contacts to cost three or four times more. While not typical, in cases when a complex, highly customized scleral lens is required, cost can be as high as $4,000 per eye or more. Most insurance programs do not automatically cover the full cost of scleral contact lenses. In some cases, vision insurance may reduce the cost of your lenses and/or fitting fee. In comparison, most conventional GP contact lenses are 9.0 to 9.5 mm in diameter and cover only 75 to 80 percent of the cornea. Another category of gas permeable lenses bridges the size gap between conventional GP lenses and mini-sclerals.
