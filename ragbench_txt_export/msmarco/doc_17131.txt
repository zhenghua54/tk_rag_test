The Fast Carbon Cycle. The time it takes carbon to move through the fast carbon cycle is measured in a lifespan. The fast carbon cycle is largely the movement of carbon through life forms on Earth, or the biosphere. Between 10 15 and 10 17 grams (1,000 to 100,000 million metric tons) of carbon move through the fast carbon cycle every year.
