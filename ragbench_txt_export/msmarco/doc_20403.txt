Lack of Diversity. A business with a clan culture tends to be a homogeneous organization. While employees with common beliefs, goals or even demographic characteristics may make united effort easier, it also robs the organization of the benefits of diversity. Potential for Abuse. A clan culture is open, friendly and arguably more appreciative of its employees than any other. However, this comfortable culture is vulnerable to abuse if employees use its tolerance as an opportunity to relax rather than an opportunity to contribute.
