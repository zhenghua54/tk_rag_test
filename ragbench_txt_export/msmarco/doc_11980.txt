This is an early form of rental subsidy that was used in Section 221(d)(3) and Section 236 developments prior to the Section 8 program. Some developments still have rent supplement assistance. Your rent is the higher of either 30% of income or 30% of the gross rent. A number of apartments are subsidized under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation (or mod rehab) program. In exchange for providing a moderate level of rehabilitation to a property, the owner is provided a rent subsidy for a number of years by the local housing authority or a regional nonprofit housing agency.
