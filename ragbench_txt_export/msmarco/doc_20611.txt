So 'Char Wallah' was created. They have sourced the best quality tea and offer a range of teas to suit everyone's palate, from strong black teas through to the herbal infusions, so customers can enjoy the diverse tastes of tea.

What impressed him too was the incredible health benefits of drinking tea.
