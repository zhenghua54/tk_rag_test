However, if your mortgage was a refinance loan, you must typically spread the deductions over the life of the loan. For example, if your origination fees equal $4,500 for a 30-year loan, you can deduct $150 each year for the next 30 years. Unlike loan origination fees, most other fees you pay at the closing of a mortgage loan are nondeductible. Nondeductible closing expenses include appraisal fees, title insurance and attorney fees. However, you can deduct any prepaid interest you pay at closing.
