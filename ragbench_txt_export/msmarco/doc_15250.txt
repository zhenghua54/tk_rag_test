378 2.4 The Synuclein family in Parkinson disease The SNCA gene is located on chromosome 4q21-22 and is associated with susceptibility to PD and DLB. Alpha-synclein has two paralogous genes, beta- (SNCB; MIM#602569) and gamma-synuclein (SNCG; MIM#602998) with which it shares a highly conserved N-terminal domain. After the detection of SNCA locus triplication, SNCA duplications were also reported in two families from France and Italy (Chartier-Harlin et al., 2004, Ibanez et al., 2004). Chartier-Harlin et al detected one duplication family among nine ADPD.
