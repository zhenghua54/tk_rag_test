DNA vs mRNA. Nucleic acids are large macromolecules found in all known forms of life. There are two types of nucleotides namely; DNA and RNA. mRNA is classified under RNA. In both DNA and mRNA, genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons. Each codon consists of three bases and encodes for a specific amino acid with the exception of stop codon, which terminates protein synthesis process. DNA.
