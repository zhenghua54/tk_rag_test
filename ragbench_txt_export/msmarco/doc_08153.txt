Considering I usually have babies around 8 pounds (newborn sizes only usually go up to 8 pounds but most will still still fit a 9 pound baby), I only buy about 3-4 sleepers in newborn size and then will stock up on about 10 sleepers in 0-3 months. If you donâ€™t mind doing laundry every other day, then you may only need 5-6 sleepers in each size. This would give you enough sleepers to plan for changes throughout the day due to diaper blowouts and spit ups.
