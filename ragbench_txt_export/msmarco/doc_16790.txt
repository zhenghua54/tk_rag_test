Comprehensive insurance can help you pay for your car's repair, or even help you replace it entirely in the case of a total loss, due to any of the following: 1  Damage not resulting from a collision, including: 2  Falling objects. 3  Fire. 4  Certain natural disasters. 5  Vandalism. 6  Theft. 7  Glass damage. 8  Damage from hitting an animal. Just because it doesn't cover everything outside of collisions doesn't mean comprehensive insurance isn't valuable. In fact, it covers a wide array of events that can damage your car, including rockslides on twisting mountain roads, vandalism, and fires.
