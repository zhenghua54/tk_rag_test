Best Answer: http://www.liftport.com/files/521Edwards... It would probably cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The problem is finding a material strong enough to support itself without breaking. Kevlar is not strong enough with a tensile strength of about 3.7 gigapascals. Carbon nanotubes are strong enough with a tensile strength of 63 gigapascals. The idea would be to tether a very small asteroid at the top just a few kilometers PAST geo synchronous orbit to keep the space elevator cable under tension at all times.
