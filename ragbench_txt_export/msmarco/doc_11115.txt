A slab of baby back ribs will weigh 1 1/2 to 3 pounds (700g to 1 1/3 kg.) Slabs with less weight are considered better as they are from younger pigs. Baby Back Ribs don't have as much fat as spare ribs do. This lack of fat in them means they won't stand up to low and slow cooking, as other ribs can.
