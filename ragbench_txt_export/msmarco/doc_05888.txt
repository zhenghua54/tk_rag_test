How much does it cost to drill a new well? It depends how deep they have to drill for the water. ANS 2 -In Canada it currently costs about $48 per foot plus a 'set up ' charge of approximately $3,500. - In my area an â€¦ average well is anywhere between 100 and 200 feet deep, so that cost would be $8,300 to $13,000.
