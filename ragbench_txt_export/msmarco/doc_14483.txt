Fortunately, Texas pays new teachers well-Texas teacher starting salaries start at $38,091. It obviously depends on the school district-Houston Independent School District (or ISD), Austin ISD, Dallas ISD, El Paso ISD, etc. all range greatly in pay. You'll want to search for those districts separately.
