Adding bleach to your laundry is an effective way to remove stains from laundry and keep your whites gleaming. Liquid bleach also kills germs. It is important to use care when adding bleach to your laundry. Using chlorine bleach on some fabrics can remove the color. Using too much bleach, even on bleach-safe items, can create holes in the fabric. It is still necessary to use laundry detergent when bleaching fabric. Bleach does not contain soaps or detergents to clean the fabric; it removes stains and disinfects.
