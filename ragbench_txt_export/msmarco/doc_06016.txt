The average cost for heating homes this winter with natural gas will average $578 in total from October to March, according to the Energy Information Administration, the independent analysis wing of the U.S. Department of Energy. That's a drop of $64 from last winter. Families that use propane gas to heat their homes will see an even bigger decline. The expected total price for this winter is $1,437, which is a $322 drop from the 2014-15 winter. Families that use heating oil will save $459, and their total cost is expected to be $1,392. Ratepayers whose homes are heated by electricity will see the smallest decline, just a small $30 drop from last winter to $930
