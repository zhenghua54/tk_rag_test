It describes a patient’s level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). Researchers worldwide take the ECOG Performance Status into consideration when planning trials to study a new treatment method. This numbering scale is one way to define the population of patients to be studied in the trial, so that it can be uniformly reproduced among physicians who enroll patients. It is also a way for physicians to track changes in a patient’s level of functioning as a result of treatment during the trial. The scale was developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), now part of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and published in 1982.
