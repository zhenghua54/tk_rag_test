After the shoulder dislocation has been corrected, it may require immobilization with a cast or sling for 2 to 8 weeks. Complete healing of injured ligaments requires a minimum of 6 weeks. If customary treatment does not prevent a recurrence, athletic activities should be modified until surgery can be done. The appropriate health care for a shoulder dislocation is a doctorâ€™s care. This will include: (1) Manipulation of the joint to reposition the bones. (2) Surgery (sometimes) to restore the joint to its normal position.
