Long-tailed tits make the most intricate and delicate of all bird’s nests – and they couldn’t do it without spiders. They spend three weeks creating their pouch-shaped luxury home. This begins with a cup and dome made of moss and stuck together with cobwebs, making it elastic. Studies have shown long-tailed tits can use up to 2,000 feathers in each nest and in their effort to collect all the various materials, they will fly between 600-700 miles! Spiders’ webs are an essential part of the design of these hanging nests and this just goes to show how closely linked birds and spiders are.
