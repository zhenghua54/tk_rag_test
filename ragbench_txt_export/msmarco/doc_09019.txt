Overview. Planting cantaloupes in your garden brings the promise of sweet melon on the summer table. Cantaloupe is a hot-weather plant, and the quickest-growing varieties require at least 70 days of frost-free temperatures to reach maturity. Cantaloupes grow best when directly seeded into the garden. The roots tolerate very little disturbance; only an experienced gardener should attempt to transplant seedlings.
