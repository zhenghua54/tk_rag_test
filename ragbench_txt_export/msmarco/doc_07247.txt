[ Infographic: Dwarf Planets in the Solar System ]. The largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres makes up nearly a third of its mass. Even so, it remains the smallest known dwarf planet, only 590 miles (950 km) across â€” roughly the size of Texas. On Jan. 1, 1801, Sicilian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered what was then considered a planet, naming it Ceres for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. Within a decade, four new objects were discovered in the same region, all also considered planets.
