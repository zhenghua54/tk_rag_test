The heart has four valves-one for each chamber of the heart. The valves keep blood moving through the heart in the right direction. The mitral valve and tricuspid valve are located between the between the atria (upper heart chambers) and the ventricles (lower heart chambers). The leaflets in the mitral and tricuspid valves are supported by: 1  Annulus: tough fibrous ring attached to the leaflets that help support and maintain the proper shape of the valve. 2  Chordae tendineae: tough, fibrous strings. 3  These are similar to the strings supporting a parachute.
