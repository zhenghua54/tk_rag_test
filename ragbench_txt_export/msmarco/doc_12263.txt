Habitat preference. During the day, common toads tend to take refuge in holes in the ground or other damp areas such as leaf piles or compost heaps. They will use similar areas for hibernation during the winter months. At night they emerge to hunt for food in rough grass, woodland, scrub or other suitable habitats. Tadpoles of the two species are more difficult to distinguish between, but toad tadpoles are generally darker, often black, unlike the brown tadpoles of frogs. Both of these can be distinguished from newt tadpoles by the absence of external feathery gills. Up to 15cm (6in) long, but generally more like 8cm (3in)
