This summer I paid $12/per foot for the hull/systems survey plus $250 to the yard for a 'short haul' - lift it out of the water for an hour or so so the surveyor can check the hull. Another $350 for the twin diesels to be checked by an engine surveyor, oil and tranny fluid analysis included. RE: Marine Surveyor Cost. Recently done in SW Florida: It cost me the loss of a purchase of a used boat because it seems the seller is balking on fixing a hull void on a SW Fla W/A. Cost was $15.00 ft, had a low quote of $12.00 Engine diag and ck was another $200.00.
