By contrast, the C-sensory pain fibers have receptors that are activated in response to dull, aching, or poorly localized pain stimuli. These pain fibers are unmyelinated, and as a result nerve impulses are generally transmitted more slowly. If a drug inhibits the release of second messengers, then the pain receptors will not be activated, the pain impulse will not reach the brain, and the person will not perceive pain from the damaged tissue. The same thing happens if the brainâ€™s response is delayed or neutralized.
