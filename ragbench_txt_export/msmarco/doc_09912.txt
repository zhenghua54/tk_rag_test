This test looks for Borrelia antibodies in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria cause Lyme disease. The bacteria are spread to humans through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated, Lyme disease can cause meningitis, or an infection of the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord.
