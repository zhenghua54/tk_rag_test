The major scale is in inches. A small toroidal transformer. Toroidal inductors and transformers are passive electronic components, typically consisting of a circular ring-shaped magnetic core of high magnetic permeability material such as iron powder or ferrite, around which wire is coiled to make an inductor. Figure 3 of this section shows the most common toroidal winding. It fails both requirements for total B field confinement. Looking out from the axis, sometimes the winding is on the inside of the core and sometimes it is on the outside of the core. It is not axially symmetric in the near region.
