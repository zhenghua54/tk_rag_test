Acupuncture is the insertion of fine needles into specific points along channels just under the skin to balance the flow of energy, or qi, through these channels. There are over a thousand known acupuncture points on the body. The connections between the acupuncture points ensure that there is an even circulation of qi, a balance between Yin and Yang. When illness or disease occurs, it points to an imbalance between Yin and Yang.
