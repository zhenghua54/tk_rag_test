Diastasis Recti is a separation of the rectus abdominus muscle. It is actually a stretching of the fascial attachments surrounding the rectus sheath as the muscles part or split. It is noticeable as a bulge in the midline of the abdominals when the trunk is flexed during pregnancy. During the post partum period this area presents as a gap in the rectus sheath.
