Exogenous DNA refers to any deoxyribonucleic acid that originates outside of the organism of concern or study. The introduction of exogenous DNA into a cell is called transformation (transfection in animal cells). Transformation is a naturally occurring process in bacteria. Bacteria need to be in a certain physiological state to successfully take up exogenous DNA, which is described as one of competence. Some bacteria are naturally competent, but usually only for a brief time at a certain stage of their growth cycle.
