The recovery time for a bone bruise seen on MRI is typically two to three months. The best things you can do during this time is to take it easy, continue to use a wrap or brace, ice every 20 minutes as necessary, and elevate each night. The term “bone bruise” is actually a bit of a misnomer, since it’s actually a fracture in the innermost layer of the bone. The external layer of bone is very organized, solid and strong. Injuries to the outer bone may be called “occult” or “stress” fractures.
