How to Secondary Ferment Kombucha. The basic idea with secondary fermentation is to draw off the kombucha liquid that has been brewing with your scoby. Instead of drinking it right away, pour it into a bottle with a swing-top cap or apply your own bottlecaps to clean beer bottles, as though you were brewing beer. Secondary fermentation is also a great time to add flavors to your kombucha. Fruit is an especially good choice, as is ginger. I love blueberries. This is a place where you will want to experiment to see what tastes good to you. With a few simple rules, the world of flavor will open to you.
