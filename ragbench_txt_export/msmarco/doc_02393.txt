PEX is the plastic piping that came about to replace the polybutylene. As a general rule you can assume that it is PEX if it any volor but gray if it was installed after 1998 and polybutylene if it was installed before 1993. The five year transition period could have either piping installed. We usually think of polybutylene pipe as being plastic and gray in color. It does come in some other colors, such as blue, white, and black. Look at the photo to the right. It shows four different pipes above a water heater.
