Angels are very active in the Bible and are used by God as messengers, warriors, and servants. The word, angel, comes from the Greek word, angelos, which means messenger.. Angels are spiritual beings without bodies of flesh and bones though they apparently have the ability to appear in human form (Gen. 19:1-22). 19:1-22). Angels had many functions. They praised God (Psalm 103:20), served as messengers to the world (Luke 1:11-20, 26-38, Luke 2:9-14), watched over God's people (Psalm 91:11-12), and were sometimes instruments of God's judgment (Matt. 13:49-50).
