PCR works by repeated cycles of strand separation, annealing of primers, and extension of the primed strands. Simply put, the target DNA is replicated in vitro, many, many times, to obtain a large amount of the DNA that lies between the two primer regions. To make primers of the correct sequence that will bind to the template DNA, it is necessary to know a little bit of the template sequence, on either side of the region of DNA you wish to amplify.
