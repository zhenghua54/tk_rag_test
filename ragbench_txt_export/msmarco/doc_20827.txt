You're absolutely right! A faulty engine speed sensor can be caused by a bad transmission. In most cases, it's found on automatics. This is why it's very important to have your car regularly checked. If a car is experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is always best if you take your car into a local garage and ask them to run computer diagnostic tests on the vehicle to see if the speed sensor is functioning correctly.
