The Ovum. Oogenesis is the process by which the female gametes, or ova, are created. The female gamete is called an ovum. Sometimes people will refer to female gametes as eggs, but the term egg can include more than one stage of development, and the definition of an egg also changes depending on the type of organism. In this lesson, you'll learn how the human body produces an ovum through the process of oogenesis. You'll also learn how polar bodies help to ensure that female gametes are of high quality even though they are not produced in high quantities.
