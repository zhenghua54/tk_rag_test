The fixed component in this example is $3,000 per month. The variable cost component is $10 per unit of output. Hence, at a production level of 500 units, the total electric cost is $8,000 [$3,000 + ($10 x 500)]. The mixed cost illustrated in the above chart is called a step function. An example of such cost behavior would be the total salary expense for shift supervisors.
