Each villus has a network of capillaries and fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and lacteals (lipids). The digested food is taken up by the walls of the small intestine. The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called villi which increase the â€¦ surface area for absorption.
