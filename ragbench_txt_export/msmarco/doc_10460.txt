The lining epithelium of the stomach, and gastric pits is entirely made up of mucous columnar cells. These cells produce a thick coating of mucus, that protects the gastric mucosa from acid and enzymes in the lumen. Even so, these cells have to be replaced after 4-6 days. When the stomach is empty, and not distended, the lining is thrown up into folds called rugae. After eating, these folds flatten, and the stomach is able to distend greatly. The stomach has three anatomical regions: 1  cardiac, which contains mucous secreting glands (called cardiac glands) and is closest to the oesophagus. 2  fundus, the body or largest part of the stomach which contain the gastric (fundic) glands. 3  pyloric, which secretes two types of mucus, and the hormone gastrin
