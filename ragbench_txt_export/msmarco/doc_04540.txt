One of the major concerns about the use of unmarked police cars for routine traffic stops is, ironically, safety. The use of unmarked cars for traffic stops has produced unintended, and quite tragic, results. The criminal used fake unmarked police cars to pull over the unsuspecting victims. The growing fear of fake unmarked cars being used to victimize drivers has inspired a groundswell of support in favor of restricting officers from using unmarked police cars to make traffic stops for routine offenses.
