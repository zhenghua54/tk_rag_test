Growth in diameter. Making a bone grow in diameter is a more straightforward process. To make a bone thicker, just add new bone tissue to the outside. It's like taking a pipe and adding layer after layer of duct tape to it. The pipe would get thicker and heavier as you go. The problem is the bone gets thicker and heavier as you go. Growth in length. To make a bone longer just add bone tissue to the ends. The problem is, we can't add directly to the end of a bone, it has to move at the joints. If tissue is added at the end of the bone the skeleton could not move properly.
