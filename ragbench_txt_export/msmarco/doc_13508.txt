The term apostle was used in a second way in Scripture, as one who was commissioned and sent by a community to preach the gospel. Saul of Tarsus, a persecutor of Christians who was converted when he had a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus, is also called an apostle. We know him as the Apostle Paul. The word apostle is derived from the Greek apostolos, meaning one who is sent.. A modern-day apostle would typically function as a church planterâ€”one who is sent out by the body of Christ to spread the gospel and establish new communities of believers.
