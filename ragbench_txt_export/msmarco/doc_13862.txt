You can’t repair a condenser coil and a compressor is extremely expensive to replace — it’s generally not worth it unless it’s covered under warranty. However, if your air conditioner stops running due to an evaporator coil, replacement is usually in the 100s of dollars, making it an affordable and wise decision. The part itself usually runs between $250 to $550 wholesale, with the low-end based on a 2-ton air conditioner and the high-end based on a 5-ton air conditioner. Add a few hundred for labor and it comes to anywhere between $500 to $900 for replacement.
