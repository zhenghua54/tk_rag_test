For what it is worth: To reset the Maintenance Required light on my 2007 Toyota Corolla: 1) Set your â€¦ trip meter to the odometer setting (in other words, not Trip A or Trip B) 2) Hold down trip meter reset button and turn ignition to off. 3) While holding down the trip meter reset button now turn the ignition to on.
