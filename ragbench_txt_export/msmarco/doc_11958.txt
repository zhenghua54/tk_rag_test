Ad. Demersal or benthic habitats are found on the bottom of the oceans. They are divided into the shallower coastal benthic and the deep ocean benthic habitats found beyond the continental shelf. Coral reefs are a benthic habitat in shallow, warm waters where an abundance of light penetrates. Here, no light penetrates and plants are not found. Organisms living in this ocean habitat are primarily detritus eaters, subsisting on the organic matter that floats to the bottom of the sea. Little studied due to the difficulties involved, this deep area is believed to be rich in biodiversity.
