But how long can you keep it before it reaches the yucky point of no return? That depends a lot on whether you’ve cut it up or not. A whole, uncut cantaloupe or honeydew melon should last for seven to 10 days in the refrigerator. A whole, uncut watermelon is even sturdier: It should be good for two weeks. The picture gets somewhat bleaker once you’ve sliced into your fruit.
