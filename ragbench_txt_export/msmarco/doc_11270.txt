The history of coins used primarily as currency in the Western world usually begins by mentioning Lydia, the neo-Hittite civilization that arose in the 12th century B.C. Coins dating back to around 643 B.C. in that region were found made of electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver. These coins are generally considered the first real use of metal for money, because they were guaranteed by the Lydian rulers, and were manufactured consistently.
