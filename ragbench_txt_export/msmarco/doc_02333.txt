Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, the sugar primarily found in milk and dairy products. It is caused by a shortage in the body of lactase, an enzyme produced by the small intestine, which is needed to digest lactose. While lactose intolerance is not dangerous, its symptoms can be distressing. Lactose is also added to some foods, such as bread and baked goods, cereals, salad dressings, candies, and snacks. Foods that contain whey, curds, milk by-products, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk also contain lactose.
