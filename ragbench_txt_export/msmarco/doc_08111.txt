It is simply the average revenue for every square foot of retail sales space. According to Advanced Retail Management the average regional mall sales per square foot is $341 and most big box retailers average between $250 to $350. Annual sales divided by the total square feet gives you the sales per square foot. In the clothing industry, according to RetailSails, sales per square foot for Nordstrom is $400, compared with just $173 for Macy’s. At $350, Saks Fifth Avenue’s sales per square foot approaches Nordstrom’s. But, then look at Ross stores where the figure was $355 in 2012.
