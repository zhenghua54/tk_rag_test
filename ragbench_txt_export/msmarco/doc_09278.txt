A limit is the intended height of a function at a given value of x, whether or not the function actually reaches that height at the given x. In the case of f, you know that f does reach the value of 11 when x = 3, but that doesn’t have to be the case for a limit to exist. What Limit Means. Let’s start with a simple function: f(x) = 2 x + 5. You know that this is a line with slope 2 and y-intercept 5. If you plug x = 3 into the function, the output will be f (3) = 2 · 3 + 5 = 11.
