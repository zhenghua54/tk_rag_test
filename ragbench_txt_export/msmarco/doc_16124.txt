S phase is the restricted part of the eukaryotic cell cycle during which synthesis of DNA occurs. G2 phase is the period of the cell cycle separating the replication of a cell's chromosomes (S phase) from the following mitosis (M phase). The spindle guides the movement of chromosomes during cell division.
