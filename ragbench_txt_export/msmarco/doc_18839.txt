Lungworm infections in dogs are usually caused by the parasitic nematode Oslerus osleri. They have been found in the United States, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Great Britain, France, and Australia. Diagnosis of lungworm infection is based on signs, known transmission patterns, and presence of larvae in feces. Examination of the airways with an endoscope (bronchoscopy) and x-rays can be helpful tools.
