Report Abuse. Devices in a wireless network are set up to either communicate indirectly through a central place — an access point — or directly, one to the other. The first is called Infrastructure Mode and the other is called Ad Hoc mode (it's also called peer-to-peer). Here are key differences between the modes. Because Ad Hoc Mode does not require an access point, it's easier to set up, especially in a small or temporary network. Infrastructure takes advantage of the high power of an access point to cover wide areas.
