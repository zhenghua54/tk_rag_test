Most persons with chronic HCV infection are asymptomatic. However, many have chronic liver disease, which can range from mild to severe, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronic liver disease in HCV-infected persons is usually insidious, progressing slowly without any signs or symptoms for several decades. Approximately 2.7 million persons in the United States have chronic HCV infection. Infection is most prevalent among those born during 1945â€“1965, the majority of whom were likely infected during the 1970s and 1980s when rates were highest.
