Zanamivir is an antiviral medication. It blocks the actions of viruses in your body. Zanamivir is used to treat flu symptoms caused by influenza virus in patients who have had symptoms for less than 2 days. Zanamivir may also be given to prevent influenza in people who may be exposed but do not yet have symptoms. Zanamivir will not treat the common cold. Before using zanamivir, tell your doctor if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or any other chronic lung condition. Serious or life-threatening bronchospasm (difficulty breathing) and other effects on the lungs can occur while using zanamivir.
