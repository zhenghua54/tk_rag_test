Tissue Specifics. It is estimated that the average, healthy adult has over 300 million alveoli. Alveoli are small sacs of tissues in each lung surrounded by capillaries and blood vessels. There is a thin cell layer between the sacs and the surrounding blood vessels. There is also a thin fluid that surrounds the alveoli sac. The fluid and thin cell wall allows air to pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.
