An electron is a subatomic particle that has a negative charge of -1 and is located in the volume of atoms around the nucleus (so not in the nucleus itself) Electrons have no known components or substructure and are therefore generally considered to be elementary particles. 1  Electrons exist in the volume of atoms that surrounds the nucleus (see the diagram of an atom, on the right) and. 2  in the. 3  of atoms-which is where the protons and neutrons are located.
