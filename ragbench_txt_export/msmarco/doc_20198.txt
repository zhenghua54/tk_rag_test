To measure range of motion, physical therapists most commonly use a goniometer, which is an instrument used to measure angle at a joint. Goniometers show degrees of an angle from zero to 180 or 360 degrees and are available in different shapes and sizes for the unique joints in the human body. There are three primary types of exercises specific to range of motion. Passive range of motion is typically practiced on a joint that is inactive. The physical therapist may use this exercise on a client who is paralyzed or unable to mobilize a specific joint.
