Remember that the roast will continue to cook for a little while once removed from the heat, so take it off about 5 degrees shy of your desired temperature. Remove the rotisserie roast beef from the grill, place on a platter and cover with aluminum foil to rest for about 15 minutes. While the roast is resting, make a rue using about 2 tablespoons of butter and about a tablespoon of flour (look for directions online if you haven't made gravy before).
