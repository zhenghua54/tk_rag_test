ABOUT the song, Goldfinger: Goldfinger was the title song from the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Composed by John Barry and with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, the song was performed by Shirley Bassey for the film's opening and closing title sequences, as well as the soundtrack album release. Shirley recorded two versions of this song. She recorded the soundtrack to the movie, 'Goldfinger' and then she recorded a version to be sold as a 'single.' Both versions are superb, but I believe she holds that big last note longer here, on the 'Single' version! Simply amazing!
