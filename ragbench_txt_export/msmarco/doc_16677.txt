This is due to the greatly reduced number of genetically normal eggs remaining in the ovaries of a woman over forty. The pregnancy risk for women in their early 40’s is again much higher, with miscarriage rates at roughly 35%, and the risk of Downs syndrome about 1/38. For this reason many women in their 40’s choose to use an egg donor to become pregnant, with success rates of about 80% per cycle. There is a very sharp decline in a woman’s ability to fall pregnant once over the age of 40. The fertility rate per month is only about 5% per month and even with IVF the pregnancy rate is only about 10% per try.
