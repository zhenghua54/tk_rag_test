Report Abuse. Manifold pressure is the absolute atmospheric pressure in the intake manifold of the engine. It may either be below (vacuum) or above (tubocharged / supercharged) than ambient air pressure. Without a supercharger or turbocharger, both of which force more air into the intake manifold, the maximum manifold pressure is the ambient pressure around the airplane, with a slight loss due to the throttle plate.
