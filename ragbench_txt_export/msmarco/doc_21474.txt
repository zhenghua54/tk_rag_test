An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to capture images inside your body without making a surgical incision. The scan allows your doctor to see the soft tissue of the body, like muscles and organs, in addition to your bones. An MRI can be performed on any part of your body. Your doctor might order a lumbar MRI if you have the following symptoms: 1  back pain accompanied by fever. 2  birth defects affecting the spine. 3  injury to the lower spine. 4  persistent or severe lower back pain. 5  multiple sclerosis. 6  problems with your bladder.
