The Egyptians also observed the beetle rolling it's egg ball of along the ground, and the ball was identified with the sun and the beetle with the god Khepri who pushed the ball of the sun across the sky. The egg hatches and the grub eats the dung and then pupates to emerge from the ground as a new adult beetle. The ancient Egyptians saw how these beetles lived and emerged from dry ground and used this as a metaphor for the entombing and resurrection of their mummies.
