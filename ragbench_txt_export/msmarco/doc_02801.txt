When choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon in your area for liposuction, remember that the surgeon’s experience and your comfort with him or her are just as important as the final cost of the surgery. Liposuction cost can vary widely. The average fee referenced above does not include anesthesia, operating room facilities or other related expenses. A surgeon’s fee will be based on his or her experience, the type of procedure used, and the geographic office location.
