DEFINITION of 'Covered Bond'. Securities created from public sector loans or mortgage loans where the security is backed by a separate group of loans. Covered bonds typically carry a 2-10 year maturity rate and enjoy relatively high credit ratings, depending on the quality of the pool of loans (cover pool) backing the bond. Covered bonds are often attractive to investors looking for high-quality instruments that offer attractive yields.
