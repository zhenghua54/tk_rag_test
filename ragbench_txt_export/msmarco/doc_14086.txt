It is a ring form of a solenoid. Its annular shape is generated by revolving a plane geometrical figure about an axis external to that figure which is parallel to the plane of the figure and does not intersect the figure. If the revolved figure is a circle, then the surface of such an object is known as a torus. More generally, a toroid may have any number of holes, may or may not be orientable, and its surface may be decomposed into polygonal faces. One of the best-known applications of the toroid shape is in a Tokamak device, which uses a magnetic field to confine a plasma in the shape of a torus
