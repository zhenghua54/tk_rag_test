A. Getting a DUI is expensive, but getting an ignition interlock installed doesn’t have to be. The pricing is considerably low cost and affordable. Intoxalock ignition interlock leases start as low as $65 per month for court or state mandated Legacy devices. Final pricing depends on your state’s requirements for technology and reporting, and how long you will need the equipment. Voluntary (non-DUI related) leases start at $49.95 per month. Top
