Computer hardware (usually simply called hardware when a computing context is implicit) is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system. In contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Software is any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer's processor to perform specific operations. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system.
