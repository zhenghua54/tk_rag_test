A urine glucose test is used to indirectly determine whether your levels of glucose, or blood sugar, are within a healthy range. It's used to monitor both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If your blood glucose rises above normal, your kidneys get rid of the extra glucose in your urine. That's why a urine glucose test may be able to determine whether your blood glucose is too high. Although easier to perform than a blood test, a urine test for glucose is not as accurate as a blood test. Urine tests are usually used only when blood testing for glucose is difficult or impossible.
