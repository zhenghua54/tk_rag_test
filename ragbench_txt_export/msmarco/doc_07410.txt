If you want to build your dream deck or patio you should anticipate costs starting at $8,000 and reaching up to $40,000 for multiple levels, stairs, outdoor speakers, fire place, and cooking area. I researched the average cost of a simple patio and it turns out that on the low end a simple concrete pave patio can be installed for around $2000. A covered patio complete with over head fan will likely cost $5000 to $7000.
