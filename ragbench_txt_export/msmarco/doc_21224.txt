The height of a person is primarily determined by bone structure and is not easilly reduced. A person's height will reduce slightly as the discs between the spinal vertebrae become thinner with age. In addition, people with osteoporosis appear to shrink in height, but that appearance is due to the bending of the spine, producing the characteristic hump high on the back.
