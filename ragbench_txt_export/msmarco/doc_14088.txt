A toroid is a coil of insulated or enameled wire wound on a donut-shaped form made of powdered iron. A toroid is used as an inductor in electronic circuits, especially at low frequencies where comparatively large inductances are necessary. A toroid has more inductance, for a given number of turns, than a solenoid with a core of the same material and similar size.
