The viral genome. The viral genome of a virus is a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA. It can be double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded(ss), and it might have a sense. The sense is a property possessed by some nucleic acids, the ssRNA. The structure of a simple virus consists of a protein shell and a viral genome. The size of an ordinary virus usually varies from 10 to 300 nm and it is composed of a viral genome and a capsid. Sometimes there is also an enveloppe. More complex viruses also occur, with two protein shells for example
