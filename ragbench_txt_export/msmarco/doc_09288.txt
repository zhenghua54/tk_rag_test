Tomatoes: are best started indoors at soil temps of 70 to 90째F, and then transplanted outdoors when soil temperatures are consistently above 50째F. Chard is an exception to almost every rule: its seeds enjoy and germinate best in cooler temperatures. Broccoli: is best germinated indoors at temps of about 85째F, 6 weeks before you plan to transplant. Celery: is best germinated indoors at 75-85째F. These tiny seeds are very hard to sow without overplanting and will have to be carefully thinned to the strongest plants.
