Lasers and pulsed light target several follicles at once, so you can treat large areas of skin. While it would take years to perform electrolysis on the back or legs, a typical laser hair removal session on both legs usually takes under two hours. Lasers are great for treating the back, shoulders, arm and chest. For upper lip and chin, lasers work but only on dark hair. Laser hair removal is not cheap. Depending on what body part you treat, it can run from $200 to $2,000 a session, not including tax and tip.
