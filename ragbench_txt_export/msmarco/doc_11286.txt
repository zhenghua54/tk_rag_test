Scientific names are in Latin or Greek. The riparian brush rabbit is a subspecies of the brush rabbit species. Biologists add riparius to the species name to say that this is the riparian subspecies. So the scientific name of the riparian brush rabbit is Sylvilagus bachmani riparius. Brush rabbits are in the Leporidae family. But it has lots of pictures and information.
