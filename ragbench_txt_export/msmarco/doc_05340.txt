Examples: granite, gabbro, diorite, peridotite. Extrusive rocks are formed from magma at or above the surface of the planet, and generally display smaller mineral crystals, or no crystals at all, because of the rapid cooling environment in which they form. Intrusive igneous rocks is formed from magma that cools, solidifies, crystallizes, and hardens slowly within the earth's crust, and this makes its crystals large.
