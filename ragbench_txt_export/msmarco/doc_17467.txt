California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood â€“ Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The two most prominent rivers within California are the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay.
