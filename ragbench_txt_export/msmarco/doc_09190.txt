The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the heart to the aorta, and out to the body. Normally, the aortic valve has three leaflets that work to keep blood moving in one direction. With bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), two of the three leaflets of the aortic valve fuse during a person's fetal development.
