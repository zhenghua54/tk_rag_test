The geological history of Hong Kong has been strongly controlled by changes in the plate tectonic setting over the past 400 million years. Significantly, there are major gaps in the geological record in Hong Kong, which probably reflect major changes in the tectonic regime of the region. Between 250 and 200 million years ago, there was a major tectonic event in China, possibly resulting from major plate reorganisation. This was accompanied by the intrusion of granite magmas. The older rocks in Hong Kong were strongly deformed.
