In an older child or adult, normal values of direct (conjugated) bilirubin are from 0 to 0.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Normal values of total bilirubin (direct and indirect) are from 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL. Testing for bilirubin in the blood is therefore a good test of damage to your liver. Newborn infants often have some jaundice, and bilirubin in the blood may be tested several times in the first few days of an infantâ€™s life to check that the liver is starting to work properly.
