Barnet Copthall Stadium in 2006 before renovation. Barnet Copthall is a leisure complex in Hendon, London NW4, near the border with Mill Hill. At its centre is a stadium known for sponsorship reasons as Allianz Park, the home ground of rugby union Premiership side Saracens since February 2013. Today, the complex houses a local authority-owned swimming pool and gymnasium facilities next to the new Allianz Stadium which is primarily used for Rugby and Athletics. The stadium opened in January 2013, after Saracens began the 2012â€“13 season as a nomadic club, using 5 different venues for home matches (Twickenham, Wembley, Vicarage Road, King Baudouin Stadium and Stadium MK).
