Annual allowances. For each tax year, there’s a limit to the amount you can deposit into your ISA – this is your annual allowance. The allowance for the 2015/2016 tax year is £15,240, which you can invest in a cash ISA, an investment ISA or a combination of the two. Tax-free interest every year. The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April.
