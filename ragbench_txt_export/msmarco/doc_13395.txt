A muscel cell is not an example of a gamete cell. A gamete cell is  a reproductive cell that unite during sexual reproduction to form a  new cell called the zygote. In males … the sperm is the gamete cell  and in females the ovum is the gamete cell. An Amoeba is an example of a cell. In fact, an Amoeba is the only complete one cell organism; it is complete, and ready to carry out all life functions. This gives the Amoeba … a position in the animal kingdom, and that sets it apart from all other cells.
