Usually, you can find the drywall price by doing this little trick: Take the floor square footage, which in your case is 1,200. Multiply the floorspace by about 5, to be safe. (This would give you a ballpark figure of all your wall and ceiling surfaces, and a little over to be safe). This gets you at about 6,000. That's roughly how many sq ft of drywall it would take to do your home throughout, assuming you have 8' ceilings. Then multiply your footage (6,000) by your area's going rate for hanging and finishing. A good company usually gets around $1.00/ft give or take 20 cents depending on area.
