Occurrence varies with nationality. Ingrown Hairs Ingrown hairs form when hairs, growing back after shaving, waxing, electrolysis, or other hair removal method, and fail to grow out of the skin. The hairs curl over inside the follicles under the skin (just like the razor bump hairs curl above the skin). By curling, then creates and unsightly bump. No other product in the world can do all that Tend SkinÂ® Liquid does, especially when it comes to ingrown hairs and razor bumps (Pseudofolliculitis barbae, PFB).
