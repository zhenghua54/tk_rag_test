An AAA server refers to the process of authentication, authorization and accounting utilized by the Remote Authentication Dial In User Services (RADIUS) network protocol. RADIUS permits remote users or computers to access a computerized network server. When the AAA server process is not required, a server is called “open” or “anonymous.” RADIUS and AAA server protocol is usually used by internet service providers (ISPs) to identify and bill their clients.
