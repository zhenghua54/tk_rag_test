1 Organic arsenic is found in many foods and particularly in some shellfish. 2  The organic forms and amounts of arsenic found in seafood are generally considered to be nontoxic. While found in lower amounts in many foods and particularly seafoods, higher concentrations of dietary organic arsenic may be found in bivalve mollusks (clams, oysters, mussels) and crustaceans (crabs and lobsters).
