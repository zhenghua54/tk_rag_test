(Redirected from Ori (Genetics)). Ori is the DNA sequence that signals for the origin of replication, sometimes referred to simply as origin. In E. coli, ori is some 250 nucleotides in length for the chromosomal origin (oriC). The plasmid ori sequences are similar to oriC. During conjugation, the rolling circle mode of replication starts at the oriT ('T' for transfer) sequence of the FAT plasmid.
