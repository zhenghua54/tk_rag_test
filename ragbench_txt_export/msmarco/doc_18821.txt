1 A plumber typically charges $200-$500 to install a standard utility sink if the basic hook-ups and vents are already in place, or $500-$1,300 or more to add he basic hook-ups; the utility sink itself can cost another $50-$900 or more. 1 Most plumbers charge a two-hour minimum or a service call fee of $75 -$150, and some plumbers bill a flat fee per job instead of an hourly rate. 2  Either away, exact costs will depend on the complexity and type of work done.
