Step 1: Step 2: To help keep your PDF’s separate create a folder, using the create folder button on the bottom right, called “pdf” or whatever you wish to name it. Step 3: Now open your pdf folder and click the “Upload Files” button. This will allow you to select a file from your computer. Then clicking the “Start Upload” button. Step 4: Now navigate to the article you wish to insert your pdf in. To make sure that the URL is pointed correctly open a new tab and copy and paste the URL into it. It should open up your desired PDF file. Select whether you want to open the file in the same window or a new window from the “Target” drop-down menu. Next, Click “Insert” and save your Joomla article.
