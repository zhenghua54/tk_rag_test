If we take that $.095 cents a square foot price of $2,375.00 dollars and apply your estimated production rate, it will tell you how much time it will take to clean. For example, if you estimate your productiom rate to be 3800 square feet per hour, then you will have about 6.5 man hours to clean the building per service. (25,000 รท 3800 = 6.58). When you take these numbers to figure out the hourly rate you'll be making, it comes out to around $16.86 dollars an hour. So let's do a quick example of pricing by the hour. You've got an 8,000 square foot office building that is to be cleaned twice a week. After workloading the location you estimate it can be cleaned in 2.75 hours per service (or 2 hours, 45 minutes).
