The plant generally loses its leaves in winter. Even in summer, though, the plant is more stems and blooms than foliage. Slow growing desert rose can grow as much as 4 feet tall...but that takes quite a while. And a light spring pruning for fullness, shape and more flowers will keep the overall size much smaller.
