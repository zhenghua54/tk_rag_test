The analysis of the anatomical and physical bases of learning and memory is one of the great successes of modern neuroscience. Thirty years ago little was known about how memory works, but now we know a great deal. This Chapter will discuss four issues that are central to learning and memory. The declarative memory system is the system of memory that is perhaps the most familiar. It is the memory system that has a conscious component and it includes the memories of facts and events. A fact like 'Paris is the capital of France', or an event like a prior vacation to Paris.
