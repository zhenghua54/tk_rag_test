How to Saute Chops. The easiest way to fry pork chops is to saute them, which means to cook them quickly in a little oil in a skillet. Boneless or bone-in rib or loin chops, cut 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, work well for this. For four chops, heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
