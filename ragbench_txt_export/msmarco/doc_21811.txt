So, just $5 per day each. Thatâ€™s $2 less per person per day than the average USDA food budget. For a family of 4 that is $600 per month, with some families coming in a lot lower. The average USDA monthly food budget for that same family is $840. My family ranks toward the high end of the range mainly because we like to eat a larger amount of meat, raw milk and fresh cheese.
