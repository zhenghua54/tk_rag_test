Extremely hazardous: 9-10. Narrabeen-Collaroy beach (NSW 310) is Sydney's second longest beach. The 3.6 km long beach curves in a gentle east-facing arc between 20 m high Narrabeen Head in the north to rocks and low cliff at Collaroy Point, with beachfront houses and apartments backing much of the beach (Fig. 4.206).
