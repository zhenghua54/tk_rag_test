Companies should analyze and track what their competitors are doing. It is important to know the strengths, weaknesses, objectives, and strategies of the competition. The marketing plan is an important document used by companies for planning. It is a road map and surveys the business environment, describes problems, threats and opportunities in the industry, contains a marketing strategy, and has financial projections/budgets. Do not confuse a marketing plan with a business plan.
