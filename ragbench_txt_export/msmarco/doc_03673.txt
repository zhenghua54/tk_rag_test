The blood-brain barrier has two specific proteins involved in this process â€” one brings the beta-amyloid out of the bloodstream into the brain, while the other protein does the opposite. Perhaps keeping the beta amyloid out of the brain might be a prevention, or even a cure, for Alzheimer's disease. We can now see that the blood-brain barrier is not just a flyscreen with little holes in it, but a vital organ made of many different types of cells. The anatomy and micro-anatomy is astonishing. The blood vessels in the brain (and in the spinal cord as well) are lined on the inside with specialised endothelial cells.
