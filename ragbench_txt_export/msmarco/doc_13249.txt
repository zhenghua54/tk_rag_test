Synthesis Reactions. Synthesis reactions take place when two or more elements or simple compounds form a single compound. There are five different types of synthesis reactions: element + element, metal oxide + water, nonmetal oxide + water, metal oxide + nonmetal oxide, and metal chloride + oxygen. Synthesis Reaction. A synthesis reaction is defined as the combining of 2 or more elements/compounds to form a single compound. In this cartoon the skinny bird (reactant) and the worm (reactant) combine to make a product, the fat bird.
