It should be noted that the average age for menopause is 51 and menopause can often last well into a woman’s 50s. Late-onset menopause refers only to the age at which menopause begins. Late menopause is not uncommon among obese women, since fat can produce estrogen. When a woman’s ovaries produce these hormones longer, osteoporosis and heart problems seem to also be delayed. Because of this, women with late-onset menopause actually tend to live longer.
