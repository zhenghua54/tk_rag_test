Structure [edit]. There are approximately 300 lymph nodes in the neck, and they can be classified in many different ways. Commonly used systems have been devised by the American Academy of Otolaryngology and the American Joint Committee on Cancer. One system divides the nodes as follows: 1  Level I: Submental and submandibular nodes. For lymph nodes near the cervix, see external iliac lymph nodes and inguinal lymph nodes.
