A cell is the basic unit of life, and all organisms are made up of one or many cells. One of the things that all cells have in common is a cell membrane. It is a barrier that separates a cell from its surrounding environment. This outer boundary of the cell is also called the plasma membrane. This ensures that the cells will be able to get rid of wastes and take up important nutrients and gases. The plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic. This means that it is flexible and made up of many different types of molecules. Phospholipids form the basic structure of a cell membrane, called the lipid bilayer.
