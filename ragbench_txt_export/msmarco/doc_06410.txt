Women who are not trying to conceive may be completely unaware of their blocked fallopian tubes, since infertility is often the only symptom. Since a blockage in the fallopian tubes can prevent sperm and eggs from traveling freely, they may be unable to join and create a zygote. Abdominal pain can also be caused by unrelated conditions, and it is not always (or even often) associated with blocked fallopian tubes. Still, the condition could be considered as a possibility for women who experience constant abdominal pain along with infertility or other symptoms of a blocked tube.
