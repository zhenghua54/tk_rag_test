As a heart rhythm specialist, I am often asked to see patients referred for low or high heart rates. We are asked to be the judge for what is “normal.”. The old school teaching holds that the normal resting heart rate is greater than 55 and less than 100 beats per minute (bpm). Maximal heart rates are estimated by the well known formula: 220 – your age = Max heart rate.
