Definition. The ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so your body can use it later. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood. The amount of ferritin in the blood (serum ferritin level) is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body. Iron is important for red blood cell production. Your doctor may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia due to low iron.
