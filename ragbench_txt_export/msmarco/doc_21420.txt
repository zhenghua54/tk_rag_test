The sugar present in the molecules is the main difference between the DNA and RNA. So the correct potion is 4. The sugar present in RNA molecule is ribose and in DNA molecule it is deoxyribose. Deoxyribose is the same as ribose, except that the former has one more OH. Deoxyribose sugar is less reactive because of C-H bond and ribose sugar is more reactive because of C-OH bonds.
