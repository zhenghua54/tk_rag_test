If a salaried exempt employee works more than 40 hours per week, you do not have to pay him overtime. You may, however, give him additional compensation such as a bonus or extra time off. You must pay salaried nonexempt employees overtime at 1.5 times their regular pay rate if they work more than 40 hours for the week.
