Cactus plants are the perfect symbol for endurance as you can see it with the way they’re structured as well as with the way they live. So giving out cactus to the person you have strong feeling with means that what you have is a love that endures. It’s seen as a symbol of unconditional love because even in harsh conditions, it thrives. What the Cactus Means: Endurance. Looking at cactus spawns inspiration and helps you see life in a better perspective. Even there’s no drop of water in sight and amidst the excruciating heat (or freezing cold), the cactus endures.
