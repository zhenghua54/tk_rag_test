Like adults, minors are subject to the maximum annual contribution limits for Roth IRAs. As of 2012, the maximum contribution limit is $5,000 per tax year for investors under the age of 50. A minor may not contribute more than $5,000 to a Roth IRA. Contributing to a Roth IRA may have significant advantages for minors. Minimum Age Limits. There is no minimum age limit on when an investor may begin making contributions to a Roth IRA. As long as the trustee or custodian that holds the account will allow a minor to open a Roth IRA, a child or teenager may make contributions from post tax income.
