See Temperature change as altitude increases? for info on how temperature normally decreases with altitude when there is not a temperature inversion.The rate at which the temperature goes down is down 1.1 degrees celsius for every 500 feet you go up. the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude is the higher you go, the lesser the atmospheric pressure becomes. if the air above you is less, then there is less â€¦ weight being pressed upon the air you are on. anonymous boy from small heath school y8 2011.
