Life History. The riparian brush rabbit is a small cottontail that is secretive by nature. Historically, riparian brush rabbits inhabited dense, brushy areas of Valley riparian forests, marked by extensive thickets of wild rose (Rosa spp.), blackberries (Rubus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). Riparian brush rabbits feed at the edges of shrub cover rather than in large openings. Their diet consists of herbaceous vegetation, such as grasses, sedges, clover, forbs, and buds, bark, and leaves of woody plants. One preferred plant is green clover (Trifolium wormskiolodii).
