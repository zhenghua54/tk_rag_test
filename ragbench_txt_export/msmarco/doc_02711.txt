Hyaline cartilage is covered externally by a fibrous membrane, called the perichondrium, except at the articular ends of bones and also where it is found directly under the skin, i.e. ears and nose. This membrane contains vessels that provide the cartilage with nutrition. Articular cartilage is hyaline cartilage on the articular surfaces of bones. As such, it lies inside the joint cavity of synovial joints, bathed in synovial fluid produced by the synovial membrane that lines the walls of the cavity.
