For example, eat 38 grams of fiber each day if you’re a man ages 19 to 50, 30 grams per day if you’re a man age 50 or older, 25 grams if you’re a woman ages 19 to 50, 21 grams if you’re a woman age 50 or older, 28 grams if you’re pregnant and at least 29 grams of fiber each day if you’re breastfeeding. For example, if you require 2,000 calories per day for healthy weight maintenance you should consume 28 grams of fiber each day, and if you need 3,000 calories you should eat 42 grams of fiber every day. It is ideal to get your fiber from a well-balanced diet containing plenty of fiber-rich foods
