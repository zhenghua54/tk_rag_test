In pulsars the brightness temperature can reach 10 26 K. For the radiation of a typical helium–neon laser with a power of 60 mW and a coherence length of 20 cm, focused in a spot with a diameter of 10 µm, the brightness temperature will be nearly 7010140000000000000♠14×109 K. (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between and; is the temperature of the black body; is Planck's constant; is frequency; is the speed of light; and is Boltzmann's constant.
