However, other manufactured polyamides are also important and these include an aromatic polyamide, Kevlar and plastics produced from carbamide (urea). The nomenclature for describing the linear, aliphatic polyamides (the nylons) is based on the number of carbon atoms in the repeating unit. Polyamides are polymers which contain repeating amide, -CO-NH-, linkages. Proteins are examples of naturally occurring polyamides.
