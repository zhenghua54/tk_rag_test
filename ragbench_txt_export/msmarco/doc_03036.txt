Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is a form of weight-loss surgery that involves altering the size of your stomach so you will feel fuller and eat less food. This surgery will require dramatic changes to your daily eating habits and is only recommended for patients who meet certain weight and health criteria. Your surgeon will perform the vertical sleeve gastrectomy while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and free of pain during the surgery. Most of the time, the surgery is done in a way that is minimally invasive.
