Landscape is a concatenation of the historic Dutch / German word Land / Laender, länder and The english bastardisation of The dutch Word, scape meaning. ship The word amateur comes from the Latin amator meaning lover from the verb amare meaning to lovevia the Italian amatore. I expect its current usage in English is due to the fact … that amateurs do things for enjoyment rather than payment.
