Greenpeace states its goal is to ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity  and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. Greenpeace argues that because of Arctic oil drilling, an oil spill could hurt vulnerable ecosystems. It is because the drilling project in the Hoop area of the Barents Sea is too close to the sea ice and to Bear Island 175 kilometers (110 miles) away.
