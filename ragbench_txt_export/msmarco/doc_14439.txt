Your midwife is someone you can rely on for support, care and advice during your pregnancy, labour, and after your babyâ€™s birth (NHS Careers 2013) . She can give your partner advice and support, too. Your midwife probably works in a team, and you should be able to contact her, or one of her colleagues, 24 hours a day.
