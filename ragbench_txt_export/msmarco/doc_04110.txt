In cases of depression this mechanism is simply over-sensitive or, in the worst cases, always switched on. I'm not sure how much I'm convinced by this theory, but lets assume that there is at least a shred of truth in it. It also fits well with predictive processing and the dark room problem. Predictive processing has already been applied to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and other delusions (in the form of false error signals), and similarly I think we could say that in some cases the dark room problem simply isn't a problem.
