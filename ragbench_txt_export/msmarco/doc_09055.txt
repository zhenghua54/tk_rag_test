Diamagnetic refers to the ability of a material to create an opposing magnetic field when exposed to a strong one. The effect is created by a change in the orbit of electrons, which generate small currents to oppose magnetism from external sources. Diamagnetism was first observed in the late-1700s, but the term was first derived in the mid-1800s by Michael Faraday, who discovered all materials show diamagnetic properties when exposed to a magnetic field. Strong superconductors make use of opposing magnetic forces today.
