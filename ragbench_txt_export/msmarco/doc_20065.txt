In this installment EagleLight's LED University explains what color temperature means. LED color temperature measures the color of an LED light bulb. It defines the amount of pure white, yellow, red and blue in a light. Another way to think of the color temperature is how 'warm' or 'cool' is the white LED light bulb. Color temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin and is a measure of the part of the color spectrum that is found in light. A simple way to think about this is to compare the light from the sun from sunrise to sunset.
