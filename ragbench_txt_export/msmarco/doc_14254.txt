Skirt or feather steak and it should be diced not minced. The vegetables should be sliced too, potato onion and swede. Pile veg on pastry circle, put meat on top, season with a little salt and freshly groung black pepper, seal and make a slit either side of the pasty. Put in a hot oven for about ten minutes, then turn down the heat and cook for another 20 minutes. You can make reasonable pasties with lamb or minced beef, but that is not a Cornish Pasty! It has to be chuck steak or skirt, cut in small chunks, with shortcrust pastry (not puff). Source(s): Devonian married to Cornishman. steffi Â· 8 years ago.
