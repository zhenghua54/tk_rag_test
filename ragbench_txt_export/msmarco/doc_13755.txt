The scale of the term module varies significantly between languages; in Python it is very small-scale and each file is a module, while in Java 9 it is planned to be large-scale, where a module is a collection of packages, which are in turn collections of files. Furthermore, the term package has other uses in software. A component is a similar concept, but typically refers to a higher level; a component is a piece of a whole system, while a module is a piece of an individual program.
