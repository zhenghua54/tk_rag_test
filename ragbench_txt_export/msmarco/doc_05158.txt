All nucleotides are composed of three parts: a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogen-rich structure called a nitrogenous base. The sugar can be ribose, which is found in ribonucleotides and RNA, or deoxyribose, which is found in deoxyribonucleotides and DNA. The only difference between these two sugars is that deoxyribose has one fewer oxygen atom than ribose. The five carbon atoms in the sugar are numbered sequentially.
