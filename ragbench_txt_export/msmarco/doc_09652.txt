One clear risk factor for Parkinson's disease is age. The average age of the onset of the disease is 60 years, and the incidence rises significantly with increasing age. However, about 5-10 percent of people with Parkinson's disease have an early-onset of the disease, which begins before the age of 50. An estimated 15-25 percent of people with Parkinson's disease have a known relative with the disease. In rare cases, parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20. This condition is called juvenile parkinsonism.
