At a total length of 360.5 km (224 miles), this means it is the longest river in Ireland. That the Shannon is the longest river in the wider British Isles was evidently known in the 12th century, although a map of the time showed this river as flowing out of the south of Ireland. Limerick is the end point of the river, where it flows into the Shannon Estuary. Though the Shannon has always been important for navigation in Ireland, there is a fall of only 18 m (60 ft) in the first 250 Km (140 miles).
