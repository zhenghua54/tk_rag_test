Schooling. Becoming an orthopedic surgeon typically requires eight years of schooling, although some schools offer accelerated programs. The first four years are spent in earning a pre-medical degree. These are bachelor of science programs designed to meet the prerequisites for admission into a medical or osteopathic college. A residency in orthopedic surgery lasts five years, which gives new surgeons the time and opportunity to learn their profession under the watchful eye of experienced colleagues. During those five years, residents progress from observing to assisting, then to performing increasingly complex procedures on their own.
