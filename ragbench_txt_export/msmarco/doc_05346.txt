Granite is a good example of an intrusive igneous rock. Extrusive rocks cool above the earth's surface and crystallize very quickly, as a result are finer grained. Extrusive rocks are released from the earth in the form of volcanic eruptions, which occur both on the continents and on the ocean floor. Intrusive igneous rocks is formed from magma that cools, solidifies, crystallizes, and hardens slowly within the earth's crust, and this makes its crystals large.
