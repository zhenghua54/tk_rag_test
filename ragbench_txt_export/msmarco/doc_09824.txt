In a newborn, higher bilirubin is normal due to the stress of birth. Normal bilirubin in a newborn would be under 5 mg/dL, but up to 60 percent of newborns have some kind of jaundice and bilirubin levels above 5 mg/dL. Testing for bilirubin in the blood is therefore a good test of damage to your liver. Newborn infants often have some jaundice, and bilirubin in the blood may be tested several times in the first few days of an infantâ€™s life to check that the liver is starting to work properly.
