Be the first to review this Drug. Ferrous sulfate is a type of iron. You normally get iron from the foods you eat. In your body, iron becomes a part of your hemoglobin (HEEM o glo bin) and myoglobin (MY o glo bin). Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your blood to tissues and organs. Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen. Ferrous sulfate and folic acid is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body). Ferrous sulfate and folic acid may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.
