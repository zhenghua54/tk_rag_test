Besides 209 Bi, the most stable bismuth radioisotopes are 210m Bi with a half-life of 3.04 million years, 208 Bi with a half-life of 368,000 years and 207 Bi, with a half-life of 32.9 years, none of which occur in nature. All other isotopes have half-lives under 1 year, most under a day. Bismuth (Bi) has no stable isotopes, but does have one very long-lived isotope; thus, the standard atomic mass can be given as 208.9803987(16) u.
