Such abilities are based on applying a combination of more foundational psychomotor abilities, such as hand-eye coordination, multi-limb coordination, orientation, and control of movement speed. The cognitive, associative, and autonomic stages are the three main parts of the development of new psychomotor abilities. A baseball player, for instance, needs to develop his hand-eye coordination and reaction time more so than a normal person in order to consistently hit the ball.
