Barn owls do not build nests as such. They use sheltered places under cover: originally rock crevices or better still holes in trees (a wooden base to the breeding site is pre … ferred), but old farm buildings are often ideal, hence their name. Few birds make better use of the structures provided to them for nesting sites than the osprey. Its nest is so large that it requires a sturdy site, so the bird will construct … nests on telephone poles and platforms along coasts and lakes. The osprey's nest is comprised of vines, sticks, sod and other materials.
