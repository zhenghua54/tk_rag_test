The Secret Recipe. Not only does your initial franchise fee buy you access to all of McDonald's recipes, but it gives you access to the company's successful business plan. Think of your franchise fee as insurance. Your burgers might be a thousand times better than those served by McDonald's, but if no one tastes them you cannot make a profit. Your initial franchise fee helps you circumvent that challenge by including your restaurant in a chain with the advantage of instant name recognition.
