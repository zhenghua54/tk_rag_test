As the child grows older, more lymphoid tissues all over the body will develop and so the need for the thymus gland decreases and so it wld decrease in size and will no longer be visible on chest x-rays. The thymus is an organ that starts off at about 15 grams at birth, continues to grow, and then involutes, or atrophies. What this means for your son is that his thymus could be a normal size for a 6 month old, it's just that the radiologist saw the shadow on the chest x-ray and commented. You're on the right track.
