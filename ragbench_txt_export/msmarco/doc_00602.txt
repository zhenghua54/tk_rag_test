As in many other states, Oregon families who adopt children from foster care are able to access adoption subsidy funding. This funding, on average (for monthly payment as well as a $1,500 one-time payment) results in a public cost of about $7,464 per year. The average annual net savings for one child being adopted out of foster care is $17,636 in Oregon, and it is $15,480 nationally. In 2010, AFFEC contributed to the work of getting approximately 132 children and siblings out of foster care and into homes with permanent and loving families.
