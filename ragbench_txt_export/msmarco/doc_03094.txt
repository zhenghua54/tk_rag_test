The song that launched the Lambada dance craze was this 1989 worldwide hit recorded by the French pop group Kaoma with lead vocals by Paris-based Brazilian Loalwa Braz. It sold over 5 million copies in 1989, reached #1 on eleven different charts and was the best selling single in Europe that year. Do you remember the Lambada dance craze of the late 1980s? For those of you too young to recall it, the Lambada is a Brazilian dance for couples, which is generally danced with arched legs, with the steps being from side to side or turning, with a pronounced movement of the hips.
