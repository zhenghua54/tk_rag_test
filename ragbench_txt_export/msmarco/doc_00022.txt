Basic records are documents that everybody should keep. Although the Internal Revenue Service doesn't require you to keep your records in a particular way, it does urge taxpayers to keep them in an orderly fashion and in a safe place. Also keep in mind that while the basic IRS review period is three years, there are exceptions -- in the tax collector's favor.If the agency suspects you've underreported your income or has questions about a worthless stock write-off, look out.
