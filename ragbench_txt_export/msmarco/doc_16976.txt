An Introduction to Dosing With Macrobid. The recommended Macrobid dosage for treating urinary tract infections in people age 12 and older is 100 mg twice daily for seven days. This medication is not approved for children under 12 years of age. There is only one standard dose for Macrobid Â® (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline), regardless of your age or weight. As is always the case, do not adjust this amount unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you to do so.
