Testers are paid $10 via Paypal for every website that they review. User Feel reports that the top testers earn $100-$200 a month. Clearly you arenâ€™t going to get rich doing this, but based off of the amount of time it takes to complete a review, it seems like an easy way to make some side money. Good luck Penny Hoarders!
