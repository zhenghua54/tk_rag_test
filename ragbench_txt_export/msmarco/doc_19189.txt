Sulfur in an abundant ingredient in seawater (MgSO 4 -Epson Salts). When it reaches marsh soils, the sulfur gets reduced by sulfur reducing bacteria. These bacteria, in turn, produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S-toxic at even low levels, makes that rotten egg smell). It also makes iron pyrites and iron sulfide.
