The ultimate racking strength of shear walls was reached at around or before the displacement of 20mm. Inthis study, the required minimum racking strength and minimum width for shear wall was proposed to be 500kgf and900mm, respectively. Racking resistance of shear walls decreased linearly as opening area increased. However, whenthe shear wall section left after opening cut is less than the required minimum width for shear wall, the racking resistancewas considerably less than the linear relationship between racking strength and opening area. For example, the required minimum racking is 500kgf for shear wall, then around 955mm can be obtained as the minimum width for shear walls from the equation for NB (SEC) (stabilized. envelope curve for specimens with no hold-down connector).
