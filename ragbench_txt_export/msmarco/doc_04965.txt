Each tournament requires players to pay an entry fee (the buy-in), which on the World Poker Tour is generally around $10,000 U.S., although there are events with buy-ins as low as $2,500. You can also gain entry into a WPT Main Event by winning a satellite tournament with a lower buy-in (usually around $1,000). The tournament winner generally gets between 35-40% of the pool, with the top 10-20% of the field sharing the rest. For example, if 150 players bought-in at $10,000 each, the prize pool would total $1.5 million. The winner could take home as much as $500,000, leaving $1 million to be split between the next 14 finishers. Once players are registered, their table and seat numbers are drawn at random
