Skeletal and Muscular System. The bones, joints and muscles work as a team to maintain our upright posture and allow ample movement. The circulatory system and organs, including the brain, are dependent upon movement for their resistance to disease. The adult skeletal system is made up of 206 bones, whereas babies have 350 bones in their body. As babies grow, their small bones fuse together to make larger bones. The skeletal system is incredibly strong, protecting the inner organs, and acting as a lever and attachment for the muscles. Bone is living tissue in continual renewal
