According to the Biogenic theory that is put forward by a number of geologists, the formation of fossil fuels is caused by the heating and compression of the organic products for a long time. As per this theory, oil has been formed from the remains of the algae and zooplankton in the sea bed or lakes. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. These are actually hydrocarbons that remain inside the earth's crust. There are different types of fossil fuels like petroleum, methane, coal and so on. Some of these are made up of pure carbon and others are of low ratio of carbon and hydrogen.
