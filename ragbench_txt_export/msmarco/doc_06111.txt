Angiosperms (a plant whose ovules are enclosed in an ovary) are commonly referred to as flowering plants, as opposed to Gymnosperms, or cone bearing plants. The difference between an Angiosperm and a Gymnosperm is that Angiosperms are flowering plants while Gymnosperms are not. A. include plants that use flowers to reproduce. More â€¦ information on this topic can be researched online or in a biology book. I strongly recommend Dale Layman's Biology Demystified for more info
