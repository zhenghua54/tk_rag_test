1 If you have long-standing low blood calcium levels, you may notice no symptoms of hypocalcemia. 2  If you have an acute or sudden drop in your blood calcium level, you may notice more twitching. 3  You may notice, with mildly lowered blood calcium levels, numbness and tingling of your fingers and toes.
