1337 = leet as in elite (type 1337 on a calculator and turn it upside-down). It can mean that someone is very good at a game, or anything really. It's the opposite of noob, as in newbie. NOTE: Noob and newb are 2 different things. Technically, it in itself does not mean anything, but if you type it into a calculator and turn it upside-down, it says LEET as is elite, it is used to refer to someone who â€¦ is good/skilled at something (aka opposite of a noob/newbie) PS.
