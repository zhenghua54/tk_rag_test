Like most other ballistic movements in sports, when shooting in netball, if you do it properly using a fully balanced body effort, you will be using virtually every muscle in your body during some stage, including during the aftermath-as you return to your anatomical or original, relaxed position. In most games you can only shoot from inside the shooting circle,however some people play that you can shoot from outside the shooting circle and if you do you get 2 points. I â€¦ n the netball world cup 2011 the played this rule.
