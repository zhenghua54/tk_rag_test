These trees are usually priced around $9 a foot. To remove a tree that is 45 feet tall, consumers can expect to pay around $450. Large trees are between 50 and 90 feet in height and two to four feet thick. These trees will cost around $10 per foot. To remove a 90-foot tree, consumers will pay at least $900. Anything over 90 feet will cost even more. In fact, it may cost as much as $1,400 to remove a 100-foot Red Oak.
