Body cavity searches involve the search of bodily orifices and cavities during a police search for contraband. The authorities are typically searching for items that can be smuggled past security checks, including drugs, weapons, and other items. Body cavity searches are very serious matters and should be conducted according to the specified procedures. Violations of a body cavity search requirement can affect the outcome of a criminal trial.
