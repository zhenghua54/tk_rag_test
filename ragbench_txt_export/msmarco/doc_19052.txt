Instructions. Plug the monitor video cable into your laptop. Verify that you have the correct video output port for the monitor. Most laptops provide either DVI or VGA output. Whereas DVI ports contain a group of holes next to a set of narrow horizontal slits, VGA ports contain holes only. Many monitors, but not all, come with cables for both ports. You will have to purchase an adapter if your notebook computer does not have the correct port. Twist the thumb screws attached to the monitor cable head to secure it to the laptop, if necessary. Some laptops do not have holes for these thumb screws.
