The nutrition facts clearly state 0 grams trans fat. That's because up to 0.5 grams of the stuff can be rounded down to zero, making it easy to reach 2 grams a day without even knowing it. Fast food joints like trans fats because they can be re-used for frying, which saved money. Trans fats raise LDL or bad cholesterol and lower HDL or good cholesterol. Thankfully, many manufacturers have moved away from trans fats in recent years as the health risks became impossible to ignore.
