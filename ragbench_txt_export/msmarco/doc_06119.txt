Summer annuals germinate in the spring and grow during the summer and die with frost. One of the most pesky winter annual weeds is common chickweed. Homeowners tend to overlook its germination in the fall and only notice its presence in the spring when it begins to grow vigorously in thin and bare spots of the lawn. By June, chickweed is on the down hill side of its life span and will die out when the days become hot. We are a very reactive society, however, and when we notice the chickweed, we have an overwhelming desire to do something right now. Itâ€™s too late this year to go with pre-emergent herbicides. Chickweed and other winter annuals are already up and growing. Post-emergent herbicides should be applied after the weed is up and actively growing. The target application time should be from October to early March.
