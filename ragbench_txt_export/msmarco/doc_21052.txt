Almost everywhere on the internet I see that garbanzo beans and chickpeas are the same thing. Here on Seasoned Advice I also see that the tag chickpeas comes up when you type garbanzo. About the only difference is that garbanzo bean is less common in British English than in American English, and chickpea is more common either way, but it's just a language thing.
