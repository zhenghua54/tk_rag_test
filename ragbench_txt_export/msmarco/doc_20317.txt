Depending on the track a NASCAR driver can win up to $350,000 per  race if he wins the race. Jeff Gordon placed 32nd this year and  still received $10000, Usually sponsorship on a start & park car is usually 10,000-20,000 a race. And a driver gets a good part of that too. So to answer your question alot. In the Nationwide series its between $1,000-$2,000 a race and trucks its 4900-$1
