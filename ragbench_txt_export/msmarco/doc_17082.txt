No more worrying about variable rates and how high your payment might go. Mobile Home lending is generally considered to be high risk even if your credit is good. In practical terms this means that the average mobile home loan carries an interest rate anywhere from 11% to 13%. Some are even as high as 18%! Many of our customers have lowered their rate as much as 6 - 7% saving them hundreds of dollars* every month! REDUCE your monthly payment.
