The heel bone-known medically as the calcaneus bone-is protected by a pad of fatty tissue. Repeated pounding of the heel can cause the surrounding fat pad to flatten and be displaced up the side of the heel leaving a thinner protective layer which may result in bruising of the bone and pain. Bruised heel recovery time. If you catch heel pain early and rest sufficiently, the recovery period should be relatively quick, with symptoms subsiding within a few days. If the first onset of pain is ignored and the fat pad gets damaged beyond easy repair then this is a very difficult injury to treat.
