A first salary in Retail Management will likely be in the range of £12,000-£22,000, but some graduate training schemes pay handsomely for impressive candidates. Budget supermaket chain Aldi is a go-to for its grad scheme, which pays £42,000 in the first year. It’s easy to think of Law as a quick win for your pay packet, but the reality is starting salaries vary massively. At the most competitive firms, you could get between £22,000 and £42,000 as a Trainee Solicitor. Elsewhere, £16,000 to £30,000 is the going average.
