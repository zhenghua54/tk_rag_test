A pacemaker is an electronic device that provides an electrical signal to make the heart beat when it’s own, built-in pacemakers fail. The anatomical, built-in pacemakers provide what’s called the “intrinsic” rhythm, and they can be disrupted by various conditions – ischemia for example, or by an MI. Pacemakers can be either temporary or permanent. The temporary pacemakers that we see in the MICU are made up of a control box and one single output wire leading to the inner wall of the RV (thus called a ventricular wire, or “V-wire”), and provide simple rate control by pacing the ventricles.
