Other methods rated lower: MRI without contrast (rating=6) as contrast is often necessary, myelography and postmyelography CT (rating = 5, x-ray (rating = 5)-flex/extension may be useful, NUC Tc-99m bone scan with SPECT (rating=5)-helps detect and localize pseudoarthrosis, x-ray myelography (rating = 2). IV. MRI is preferred over myelography and postmyelography CT, but may be indicated if MRI is nondiagnostic. In some circumstances (facet arthropathy, stress fracture and spondylolysis) NUC Tc-99m bone scan with SPECT may be useful.
