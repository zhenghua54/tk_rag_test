Preheat oil to 375 degrees F. Whisk the beer, flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Dip green beans into batter to coat, letting excess drip off. Fry in the peanut oil in batches, until they are golden and crisp. Remove from oil with a spider strainer to a paper towel lined sheet tray. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
