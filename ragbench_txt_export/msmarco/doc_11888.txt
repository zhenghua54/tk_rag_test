Archaebacteria --Prokaryotic, unicellular, nutrition by absorption (heterotrophic). This group of bacteria-like organisms live in harsh (high temperature, salinity, etc.) environments similar to that of ancient earth (hence the name). They cell wall structure is different than that of typical bacteria. 2. Eubacteria --Prokaryotic, unicellular, nutrition mainly by absorption (heterotrophic) with some photo-or chemosynthesis (autotrophic) all single celled organisms with no membrane surrounding the genetic material (Bacteria, Blue-green algae) and circular DNA.
