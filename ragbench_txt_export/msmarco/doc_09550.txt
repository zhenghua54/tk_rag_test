Absolute zero is -273.15 degrees Celsius and is the lowest possible temperature. The Freezing Point of water is thus 273.15 and the Boiling Point 373.15 degrees on the Kelvin Scale.    Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin: They do exactly the same thing. They measure or rather describe Temperature. Fahrenheit and Celsius uses degrees, where as Kelvin is an absolute with no degrees added to it. 39 °C is equal to 102.2 °F and 312.15 K    The conversion formula is Fahrenheit temperature = (9/5 x Celsius temperature)+ 32    The Kelvin temperature = Celsi … us temperature plus 273.15   (the Kelvin scale has its zero point at absolute zero or -273.15 °C).
