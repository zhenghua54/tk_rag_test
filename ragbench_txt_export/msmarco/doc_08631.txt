Now loan interest rates will be based on the 10-year Treasury bill each June 1 plus an added percentage â€“ an added 2.05% for undergraduate Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and an added 3.6% for graduate Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Subsidized means that the government is subsidizing (paying) the interest while the student is enrolled and often when in a grace period 2. They are not interest-free loans but are not accumulating interest during defined periods. Unsubsidized loans are collecting interest from the point of disbursement.
