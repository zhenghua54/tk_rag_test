passive transport; As fluid is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule, the concentration of urea in the luminal fluid will increase. This creates a concentration gradient for urea which favors the passive diffusion of urea out of the tubule lumen into the peritubular capillaries (passive reabsorption of urea). Obligatory-Proximal tubule. Approximately 2/3 of the filtered solute and H2O are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule in a fixed ratio. This is, water and solute are reabsorbed in a fixed pattern due to the obligatory coupling of H2O flow to solute flow in this segment of the nephron.
