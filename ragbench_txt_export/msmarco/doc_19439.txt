Making the world better, one answer at a time. I just finished looking up a slow cooker recipe for whole chicken-cook on high for 4-5 hours, or on low for 6-8 hours. Do not remove the lid for the first two hours to prevent heat loss. Rinse again and drain well. Add the greens to the slow cooker along with the remaining ingredients. Turn the slow cooker to low and cook 4-6 hours or until the greens are tender and are a gray-green color.
