Ingestion is the consumption of a substance by an organism. In animals, it normally is accomplished by taking in the substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract, such as through eating or drinking. In single-celled organisms, ingestion can take place through taking the substance through the cell membrane. Ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism, e.g.  a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood .
