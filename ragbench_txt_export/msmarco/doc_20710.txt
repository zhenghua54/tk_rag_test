The amino acid sequence of insulin was found in 1955. Knowing this sequence, and understanding the triplet code for the bases on DNA, has allowed researchers to synthesise the gene for human insulin. This could then be used to genetically modify bacteria to produce human insulin. Use the information in the table to produce the DNA base sequence for the first three amino acids of the insulin A-chain. Drag these processes into the correct order for making human insulin from genetically engineered bacteria. Put genetically-engineered bacteria into fermentation vessels. Allow genetically-engineered bacteria to grow. Harvest bacteria and break open to release insulin.
