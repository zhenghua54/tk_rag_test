Molly bolts are anchor bolts with expandable sleeves that are used to fasten objects to drywall. Molly bolts have pointed ends and expandable sleeves. When a molly bolt is inserted into a pre-drilled hole and the bolt is tightened, the threaded sleeves expand anchoring the molly bolt into the wall. Insert the molly bolt pointed-end first into the pilot hole and lightly tap the head of the molly bolt using a hammer. The amount of force that you need to affix the molly bolt into the pilot hole depends on the size of your pilot hole.
