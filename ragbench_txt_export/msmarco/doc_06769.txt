An interesting point on the illustration is that the over-supply rig costs were reasonably equal regardless of the rig size (i.e., U.S. $6,000 vs. $9,500/day for small to very large rigs). Fig. 2â€”Rig cost compared to casing capacity of the derrick and substructure. Standby rates for drilling rigs usually range from U.S. $200 to $500/day less than the amounts shown in Fig. 2. The rates include crews and drillpipe. The costs are used to estimate move-in and move-out charges.
