Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel and under the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist. A number of factors can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome, including wrist anatomy, underlying health problems and patterns of hand use. Probably not. When used alone, carpal tunnel exercises aren't likely to relieve symptoms, such as pain and numbness. And they don't replace other carpal tunnel treatments, such as surgery, behavior modification or wrist splints.
