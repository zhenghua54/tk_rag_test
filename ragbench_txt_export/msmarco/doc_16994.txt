About Mulan. At the beginning of the movie, Mulan meets with a matchmaker to try and find a suitable husband, but things go awry and she feels as though she will never be able to bring honor to her family. That evening, her family learns that her father is being called to serve in the Chinese war against the Huns. After things don't go so well with the matchmaker, Mulan is very upset and unsure about what she is meant to do in her life. She doesn't feel as though she is going along her intended path, so she sings the song  Reflection , (which happens to be my 8 year old self's absolute favorite song).
