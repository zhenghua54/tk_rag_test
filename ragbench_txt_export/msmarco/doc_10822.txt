Precision is a description of a level of measurement that yields consistent results when repeated. It is associated with the concept of  random error , a form of observational error that leads to measurable values being inconsistent when repeated. Accuracy has two definitions: 1  The more common definition is that accuracy is a level of measurement with no inherent limitation (ie. 2  free of systemic error, another form of observational error). In addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement resolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.
