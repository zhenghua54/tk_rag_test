Bush cucumber plants grow more compactly, don't send out long vines and produce their fruit all at once, usually within 40 to 50 days. Smaller cucumbers, such as pickling, ripen more quickly, in some cases as early as 40 days, and the plants reach peak production sooner than plants that produce longer cucumbers. Cucumbers grow on long vines or smaller, more compact plants. The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a member of the Cucurbitaceae plant family that includes pumpkins, squash, melons and gourds. As a subtropical plant, it does best in warm temperatures and full sunlight.
