Dear Edith, It can take another month or more after the decision to get the letter. How long it takes to get benefits after that depends on whether you have applied for Social Security Disability (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or both. It can be a month to three months after you receive the judgeâ€™s letter.
