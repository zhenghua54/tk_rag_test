This clause is based on Standard clause, Entire agreement: property documents (www.practicallaw.com/7-504-3977) but is amended for use in a contract for sale in an insolvency context. The entire agreement clause limits the Buyer's ability to rely on representations and warranties. Where title to the Property (or part of it) is unregistered, it may be convenient to annex the epitome of title to the contract (see Annex 3). For a form of epitome that may be used for this purpose, see Standard document, Epitome of title (www.practicallaw.com/5-383-5260) .
