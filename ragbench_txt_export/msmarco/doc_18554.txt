Some insurance companies reimburse fully, others not at all and many somewhere in between. The total cost of a Scleral prosthetic device (per eye) can vary. The average cost (including device and all professional services) is @ $2000.00 (range @ $1600 â€“ $2400)/per eye. The reason for this variation is that some eyes are more challenging than others.
