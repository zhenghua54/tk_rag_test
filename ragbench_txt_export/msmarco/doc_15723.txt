Canadaâ€™s Senate consists of 105 politicians, known as senators, who have been appointed by various Canadian prime ministers. They used to serve for life, but in 1965, this was reformed to merely make their terms last until their 75th birthday (though the last life-term senator did not retire until 1999).
