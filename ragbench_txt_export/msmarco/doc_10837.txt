Chicken skin is one of the many kinds of chicharon in Philippine cuisine. Although chicharon can be made with various ingredients such as pork rind, intestines (isaw) and omemtum (bulaklak), the methods of preparation are basically the same. Here are my tips for successful chicken skin chicharon. 1  Boil the meat. 2  This is to tenderize the skin, render fat as well as impart desired flavors. 3  I like to use a simple solution of vinegar, pepper corns, garlic and salt. 4  Dehydrate the meat. 1 In a pot over medium heat, combine chicken skin, vinegar, water, garlic, pepper corns and salt. 2  Bring to a boil. 3  Lower heat and continue to cook until skins render fat and are softened but not falling apart.
