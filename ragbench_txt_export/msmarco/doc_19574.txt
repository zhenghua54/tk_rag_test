Fossil fuels are a non-renewable source of energy. Formed from decomposed animals and plants that existed up to 300 million years ago, fossil fuels are located in the deposits beneath the earth. The use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) is a problem because the burning of these fuels in industry, transport and the generation of electricity releases carbon dioxide (CO2). This is causing global warming and climate change.
