Child custody can be one of the most bitter situations parents and their children will go through, and in addition to emotional costs, it can be financially expensive as well.

While attorneyâ€™s fees are certainly a large portion of the cost of a child custody dispute, other considerations ultimately control how expensive the overall ordeal will be. In addition, how the lawyer opts to bill the client can also have a huge impact on how expensive everything will be. Generally, child custody lawyers either bill through a flat fee or by the hour. If a lawyer charges a flat fee, expect to pay $3,000 - $6,000. A lower fee is in no way indicative of a low quality legal representation
