As a result, they can also form covalent bonds particularly with large anions that can be polarized easily. Non-metals can gain electrons completely to give anions and hence can form ionic bonds. But they can also share electron pairs with other non-metal atoms and can form covalent bonds too. Simply, metals lose electrons and can form only ionic bonds.
