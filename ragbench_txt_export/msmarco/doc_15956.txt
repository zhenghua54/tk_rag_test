Therefore, if your weight-loss energy goal is 1,400 calories per day, multiply 1,400 by 0.45 and by 0.65 -- equaling 630 to 910 calories -- to determine how many of your total calories should be from carbohydrates. Then, divide each of these number by 4 calories, which is 157 to 228 grams of carbs per day.
