Surface runoff is precipitation runoff over the landscape. In our section about water storage in the oceans we describe how the oceans act as a large storehouse of water that evaporates to become atmospheric moisture. The oceans are kept full by precipitation and also by runoff and discharge from rivers and the ground. Surface runoff is affected by both meteorological factors and the physical geology and topography of the land. Only about a third of the precipitation that falls over land runs off into streams and rivers and is returned to the oceans.
