The Golden Living CNA and SRNA Training Program is a great way to get started. We are always seeking qualified certified and state registered nursing assistants to join the caring teams at our Golden LivingCenters. For more information, please contact one of our Golden Living Training Centers below: All of your time spent in the Golden LivingCenter will be instructor-led, and you will get the opportunity to experience what it is like to care for patients. Classes are normally full-time, five days a week from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm.
