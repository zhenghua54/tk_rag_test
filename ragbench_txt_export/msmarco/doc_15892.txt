The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor is a key sensor because it senses engine load. The sensor generates a signal that is proportional to the amount of vacuum in the intake manifold. But the MAP sensor doesn't care because it just monitors the absolute pressure inside the intake manifold. On engines with a speed-density electronic fuel injection system, airflow is estimated rather than measured directly with an airflow sensor.
