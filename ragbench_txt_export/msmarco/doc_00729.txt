Even if your tuition or examination fees were paid by another person, you can claim a tax credit for the fees or transfer the unused portion of the tax credit to one of the people mentioned above (provided the transferred portion relates to the fees paid for the year). However, the 20% rate remains in effect for the following tuition and examination fees that you have not yet used to claim the credit: 1  fees paid for 1997 through 2012. 2  fees paid for 2013 for a semester of post-secondary studies that began before March 28, 2013.
