A two-year associate degree in math equips you with problem-solving skills that employers find attractive in many fields. The key to finding employment is to emphasize the way the degree enhances your other skills, interests and experience. Good math skills are crucial to accounting and finance clerks, and your degree makes it more likely you'll be hired before people with just a high school diploma. You can be an accounts payable or receivables clerk or work as an assistant to a certified public accountant.
