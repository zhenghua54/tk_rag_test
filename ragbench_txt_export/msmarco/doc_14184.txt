Eluxadoline is a μ- and κ-opioid receptor agonist and δ-opioid receptor antagonist that acts locally in the enteric nervous system, possibly decreasing adverse effects on the central nervous system. Following a 100 mg dose of eluxadoline, the Cmax was about 2 to 4 ng/ml and AUC was 12-22 ng.h/ml. Eluxadoline has linear pharmacokinetics with no accumulation upon repeated twice daily dosing. Its plasma protein binding was 81% and its half life was 3.7 to 6 hours and it was excreted mainly in feces.
