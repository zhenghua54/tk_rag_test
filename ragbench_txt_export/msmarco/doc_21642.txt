This amendment gave states the right to regulate or ban the sale of liquor. However, even after the 21st Amendment was passed, several states still enforced prohibition laws, and Mississippi was the last state to repeal prohibition laws in 1966. Even today, there are several counties or townships where alcohol may not be sold, though it may be consumed privately. During this period, from 1919 to 1933, the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcohol were banned across the United States due to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Though Prohibition did not begin until 1919, its roots were planted in the 1840s.
