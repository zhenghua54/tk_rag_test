To make money off of Firemaking, you need to be a member in RuneScape. The only way to make money off of the Firemaking Skill is Shade Burning. To be able to burn shades it's suggested to go to World 77, the themed world for Shade burning. You can try to sell them either on the Grand Exchange, or in the RuneScape forums. However, it is usually hard to sell them in the RuneScape forums, so the Grand Exchange is recommended. Another alternative is using the High Alchemy spell on the Longbows. You will get 768 coins for each alchemy spell.
