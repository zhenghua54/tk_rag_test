Here in Virginia, for instance, a direct cremation ranges from a low of $1145 to a high of $2995 through a funeral home, but through our Cremation Society the cost is $595 and includes all the transport (within the city) and paperwork required. In a survey of Cremation Costs last year, in a Texas community near Dallas, we found the charge for a direct cremation ranged from $710 to a high of $3820, depending on which funeral home one used. What makes these numbers even more amazing is; all these funeral homes use the SAME CREMATORY and pay the same fee!
