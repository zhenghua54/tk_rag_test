Report Abuse. The point of living is just that-it is in itself-to live. The word live has a lot of definitions, one of which being to continue in existence, and to exist means to have actual being. Life was not meant to be wasted and to be sought after lazily. There is a reason behind everything-some people don't believe that, but it's inevitable. Every action, word, emotion has a point and affects someone in some way out there. So the point in living life...is to live it-not just exist in it...but to really live it. Rose Â· 7 years ago.
