A Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) is an electronic system mainly used by a contracting authority to purchase commonly used goods, works or service within a limited duration. The buyer must usually evaluate a tender within 15 days of having received it and submit it to the Dynamic Purchasing System. This evaluation must include all tenders that match the specification. Once admitted, the supplier may improve a tender at any time but new providers can still join the DPS too.
