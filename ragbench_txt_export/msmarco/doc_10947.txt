All babies should have a hearing screening no later than 1 month of age. Most babies have their hearing screened while still in the hospital. If a baby does not pass a hearing screening, it's very important to get a full hearing test as soon as possible, but no later than 3 months of age. Even if a child has passed a hearing screening before, it is important to look out for the following signs. 1  Does not startle at loud noises. 2  Does not turn to the source of a sound after 6 months of age. 3  Does not say single words, such as “dada” or “mama” by 1 year of age.
