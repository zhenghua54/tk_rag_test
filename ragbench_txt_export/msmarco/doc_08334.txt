0 degrees Celsius is the temperature at which water freezes and boils at a 1 â€¦ 00 degrees Celsius. The kelvin degree has the same amount of heat between each degree but uses the absolute coldest point as zero (-275 C and -463 F). To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius you subtract 38 and divide by 1.8 ((F-38)/1.8=C) and Celsius to Fahrenheit you take C*1.8+38. The Fahrenheit degree uses human body temperature as base which is approximately 37-38 C and 100 F.
