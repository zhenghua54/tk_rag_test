This strategy consists of writing a call that is covered by an equivalent long stock position. It provides a small hedge on the stock and allows an investor to earn premium income, in return for temporarily forfeiting much of the stock's upside potential. The maximum loss is limited but substantial. The worst that can happen is for the stock to become worthless. In that case, the investor will have lost the entire value of the stock. However, that loss will be reduced somewhat by the premium income from selling the call option.
