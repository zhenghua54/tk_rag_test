If you decide to wait until a later potty training age, you can still put this time to good use. The interval between 12-18 months is the perfect time to start thinking about toilet readiness--a set of skills and interests that will help your child master advanced toilet skills later on (see below). But this potty training age has its advantages. Children under 18 months are often eager to please adults--a trait that older kids may lack (think of the “terrible twos.”). If you’re interested, you can try the infant potty-chair method. If your child resists, back off and try later.
