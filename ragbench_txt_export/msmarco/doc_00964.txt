Mostly what people do is gurgle salt with warm water together for the solution. That is true. But there is another way and may help you. If your gum is cut, you should eat a lot of Vitamin C. It's very helpful. I once had my gum cut. And it helped. And it healed in a few days or a week. So hope your gum heals soon and hope this was helpful.
