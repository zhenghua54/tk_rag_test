CARE International is a confederation of fourteen CARE National Members, coordinated by the CARE International Secretariat. The Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York and in Brussels in order to liaise with the United Nations and the European institutions respectively. In 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere. CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.
