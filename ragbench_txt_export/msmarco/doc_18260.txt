1 Protect your lips â€“ Make sure you wear a good sun-screen lip balm in direct sunlight as this can trigger cold sores. 2  In winter make sure you keep lips moist, use a lip balm. 3  If lips do become chapped or sore it can be easier for the virus to take hold. My problem is I have 2 in the corner of my mouth on the letter side so when they scab over when my mouth is closed when I open my mouth all the way it rips off the scab bad streachs out the wound. Also when you have a cold sore dont drink citrus drinks. The burn your mouth.
