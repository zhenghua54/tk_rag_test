Sweat the Details. Cat dander makes its way into household cracks and crevices, so it's important to thoroughly clean out these areas. When treating furniture, look for lint brushes and rollers designed specifically for removing dander; these use adhesive sheets or rubber to efficiently get the job done. A Winning Wipe Down. Stubborn pet danger clings to most surfaces. Regularly tackle walls, ceilings and baseboards by wiping them down with a mixture of hot water and a multipurpose cleanser. Water is critical, as dry dusting just stirs dander and releases it into the air, exacerbating symptoms before resettling nearby.
