Implications for Practice Clarifying the definition of the practice of applied sport psychology also has significant implications for improving the practice of performance psychology. To reiterate, it is clear that although athletes and other performers may need therapy, therapy with an athlete is NOT sport psychology. In this sense, sport psychology is really a domain within performance psychology; it is the study of performance psychology principles and interventions in the context of competitive athletics (rather than other types of performance).
