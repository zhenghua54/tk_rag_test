Procedures can be performed at a fraction of the amount you would spend on the same procedure in the US or Europe. For example, the average surgeon's fee for eyelid surgery in the U.S. is $2,500 and in the Philippines, a qualified surgeon will charge only $600 to $1,500. For liposuction, surgeon's fees in the U.S. average $2,000 per area. In the Philippines, it is around $800 for the first area and $500 for succeeding areas. Anesthesiologist's fees and facility costs are also much lower
