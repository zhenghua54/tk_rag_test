The technique of titration is used to find out accurately how much of a chemical substance is dissolved in a given volume of a solution, that is, the concentration of the solution. The technique uses a set of apparatus with which volumes of solutions can be measured to an accuracy of greater than 0.1 cm 3. The pH curve for the strong acid-weak base titration shows that phenolphthalein is not a suitable indicator but methyl orange is fine. For the titration of weak acid-strong base, phenolphthalein, but not methyl orange, is a suitable indicator.
