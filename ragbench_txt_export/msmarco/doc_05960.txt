Hydrocarbons can be gases (e.g. methane and propane), liquids (e.g. hexane and benzene), waxes or low melting solids (e.g. paraffin wax and naphthalene) or polymers (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene). 1 The general formula for saturated hydrocarbons is C n H 2n+2 (assuming non-cyclic structures). 2  Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species.
