Code specified that Schedule 40 PVC can be used underground, where the conduit passes through the house, or where it passes inside a lamppost. A thicker-walled PVC conduit (called Schedule 80) is required where the conduit is exposed above grade (above the soil) on the side of the house and/or garage. On the other hand, if you use conduit, the trench needs to be only 18 inches below the surface. Another advantage is that the conduit can carry several wires â€“ wires to control garage lights from switches inside the house, as well as the power supply wires. Not all types of conduit can be buried in the soil.
