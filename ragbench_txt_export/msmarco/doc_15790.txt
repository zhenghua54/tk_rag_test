Under the RCI Weeks program, if an owner wants to exchange their week for a week at a different resort, they would do what is referred to as “bank” or “deposit” that week into the pool of inventory that RCI manages. The RCI timeshare relationship is clearly a successful one, as RCI is dependent on a healthy timeshare industry where owners exchange their weeks to travel the globe, and timeshare resorts leverage the benefits of timeshare exchange options through RCI in order to grow their vacation ownership base.
