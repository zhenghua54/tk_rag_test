It was developed by Konstantin Stanislavsky (1863 - 1938) â€“ a Russian actor, theatre director, teacher and co-founder of the famous Moscow Art Theatre. Stanislavsky discovered that acting could be learnt and created a system, which enabled a person to train as an actor step by step. Stanislavsky System is well known all over the world as Method Acting. For thirty years the object of Stanislavsky's study was the creation of an artistically conceived image of life and of a living, truthful human being on the stage. Stanislavsky System is a great contribution, a luminous legacy to the art of theatre.
