If you have a lot of assets or your income is higher than the state median for a similar household, you will typically have to pay more in attorney fees than an unemployed person with no assets. In general, attorney fees for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy range from $500 to $3,500 depending on the complexity of the case. Larger firms with more advertising and overhead costs may charge more than a solo practitioner. Also, a newer attorney will typically charge less than a more experienced lawyer. Chapter 13 guideline fees are different for each judicial district. However, they are typically between $2,500 and $6,000 depending on whether you are an employee or have your own business. The good thing about Chapter 13 bankruptcy is that you donâ€™t have to pay all attorney fees upfront.
