Find out when you're likely to ovulate-and increase your chances of getting pregnant! Just tell us the first day of your last period and how long your cycle usually lasts (anywhere from 20 to 45 days). We'll tell you when you're most likely to be fertile over the next six months. NOTE: This tool provides approximate dates only and assumes a regular menstrual cycle. If your menstrual cycles are irregular, you may have trouble pinpointing your day of ovulation based on this calendar alone.
