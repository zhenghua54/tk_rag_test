If you are considering rhinoplasty (Nose Job) or Nose Tip Surgery…. Rhinoplasty (Nose Job) or Nose Tip Surgery is cosmetic surgery to reshape the nose. It is one of the most common of all cosmetic plastic surgery procedures. After the nose surgery you are taken every 2–3 days for a free check up to the clinic. Minimum stay in Prague is 7 days after surgery, recommended 10–14 days. Our Prague rhinoplasty surgeons use dissolving stitches, which are placed inside of your nose and do not need to be removed.
