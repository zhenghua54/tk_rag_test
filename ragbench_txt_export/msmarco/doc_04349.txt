For operating the space elevator we will assume two platform facilities with crews (20 per facility), technical staff (30 per facility), support personal (30 per facility), and administration (10 per facility). This is a total of 140 people (this is roughly equivalent to the Sealaunch program). Chapter 11: Budget Estimates. Estimating the cost of building and operating a space elevator at this stage of development is challenging, but we feel for at least large segments of the program we can get cost estimates that can guide future decisions.
