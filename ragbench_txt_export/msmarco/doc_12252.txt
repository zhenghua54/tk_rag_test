The Seleucid Empire began when Seleucos I, one of Alexander the Great 's former favorite companions, was given the satrapy of Babylon in the second division of the empire in 321 BCE. Antiochos III's death marked the end of the Seleucid Empire as a great power. The kingdom fell once more into dynastic struggles, and the eastern provinces were gradually lost due to rebellions and Parthian expansion.
