Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer and is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly in the elderly. Squamous cell carcinoma without question is related directly to sun exposure and also to age. There are superficial forms of squamous cell carcinoma which are called in situ or Bowenâ€™s disease (SCC in situ). There is a specialized form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that can occur on the genitalia called Bowenoid papulosis which is induced by the wart virus, not by sun exposure.
