Full-Time Program. LPN program lengths vary by state for full-time students. For instance, Oakland University in Michigan offers a practical nursing program that takes three semesters to complete on a full-time basis, plus nine semester hours of pre-requisite classes are required for admittance. Average pay for an LPN is just over $40,000 annually. This field is expected to experience a 20 percent growth rate through 2020. LPNs must complete an accreditation program in the state they wish to serve in order to become licensed. The time it takes to get an LPN certification varies by state and program type.
