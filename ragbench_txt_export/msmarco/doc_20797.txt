When the EPA was created in 1970, it was headed by William Ruckelshaus (1932-), a loyal member of the Republican party who earned a reputation as a skilled administrator, who was able to work effectively with environmentalists as well as businesspeople. The EPA faced little criticism until the early 1980s. For example, for fiscal year 1991, at the end of the Bush administration, the EPA's budget was just over $6.09 million. President Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal year 1999 was over $7.77 million, a 6 percent rise as compared to 1998.
