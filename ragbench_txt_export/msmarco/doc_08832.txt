Preheat grill to medium-high. Combine lemon juice, oil, garlic, and herbs in a baking dish. Season chicken with salt and pepper and grill, turning frequently, until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer to baking dish and turn to coat with marinade. Serve immediately, or refrigerate chicken in marinade up to 1 day, turning to coat a few times.
