From October 2013 there have been new rules in place for challenging a benefit decision made by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). If the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) make a decision about your benefits that you do not agree with, you have 1 month to ask them to reconsider it. However, if you appeal the DWPâ€™s reconsidered decision, then you will get ESA at the assessment rate up until a decision is made by the tribunal. For more information on ESA basic allowance rates and other benefit options, contact the Carers UK Adviceline.
