This can be the best option as long as you have the same car, donâ€™t have any major changes in your life, and are satisfied with your current auto insurance company. If you experience a life change or you are unhappy with your insurance company, however, you may decide to cancel your policy. Car insurance is the easiest way to fulfill this requirement. If you cancel a policy without first putting a new car insurance policy in place, you can face: 1  Fines or penalties for driving uninsured. 2  Liability for all of the personal injury and property damages incurred in an accident you cause.
