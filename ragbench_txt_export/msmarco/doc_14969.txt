Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant from the amphetamine family that “works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain” (NLM). The drug can legally be obtained by prescription only as it is a schedule II controlled substance. The dextroamphetamine salts constitute about 75% of the ADHD drug known as Adderall and is the active metabolite of the drug lisdexamfetamine also known by the brand name Vyvanse.
