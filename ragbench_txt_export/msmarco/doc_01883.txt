A reticulocyte count is a blood test that measures how fast red blood cells called reticulocytes are made by the bone marrow and released into the blood. Reticulocytes are in the blood for about 2 days before developing into mature red blood cells. The reticulocyte count rises when there is a lot of blood loss or in certain diseases in which red blood cells are destroyed prematurely, such as hemolytic anemia. Why It Is Done. A reticulocyte count is done to: 1  See whether anemia is caused by fewer red blood cells being made or by a greater loss of red blood cells. 2  Check how well bone marrow is working to make red blood cells. 3  Check to see if treatment for anemia is working.
