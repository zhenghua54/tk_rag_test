Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. Although land snails may be more familiar to people, marine snails constitute the majority of snail species, and have much greater diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water.
