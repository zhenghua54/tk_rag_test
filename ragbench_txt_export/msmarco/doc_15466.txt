You may no longer have the funds to pay for the policy. You may want to cash out the money that you have put into the policy, or you may want to cancel a policy with one company so that you can purchase a new policy with a different company. Try to keep the policy. If you want to cancel because of a temporary job loss or because your employer has stopped paying premiums, then consider if there is any way to continue making premium payments. You could pull money from other parts of your budget or get a part-time job. 1  Also talk with your insurance company.
