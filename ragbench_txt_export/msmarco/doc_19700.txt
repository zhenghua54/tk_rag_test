A claims representative is responsible for providing customer service, processing claims requests and resolving problems. These representatives can be found in multiple industries but are most commonly found in the service sector. Potential employers include government benefit agencies and insurance companies. The claims representative is the first point of contact for customers who need to file a claim. The purpose of a claim is to request reimbursement of a payment or to access benefits paid for through an insurance program. Clients make regular payments to obtain insurance or benefit coverage.
