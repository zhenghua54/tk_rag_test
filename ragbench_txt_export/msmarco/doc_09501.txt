Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.
