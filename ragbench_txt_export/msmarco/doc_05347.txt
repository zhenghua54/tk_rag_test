The Schieffen Plan was Germany's key war plan for invading France at the start of World War 1. It involved marching through Belgium in order to knock France out of the war quickly. The plan was devised by Alfred von Schlieffen. It involved attacking France through Belgium in the event of war with France. Due to the failure of the schlieffen plan, Germany was forced to fight World War One on two fronts and Germany's attempt to swiftly move through Belgium also forced Britain to join the war effort against Germany.
