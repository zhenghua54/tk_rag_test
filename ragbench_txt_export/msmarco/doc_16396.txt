Elderly patients are often at risk for protein-energy malnutrition because of inadequate nutrition, which has been determined to be a common comorbid factor for increased morbidity and mortality in elderly burn victims. Populations in both acute-care and long-term facilities are at risk for clinically significant involuntary weight loss (IWL) that can result in protein-energy malnutrition. IWL is defined as a loss of 4.5 kg or greater than 5% of the usual body weight over a period of 6-12 months.
