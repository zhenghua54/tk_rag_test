For FMF, the maximum daily dose of colchicine is 1.2 to 2.4 mg, administered in divided doses. Because coadministration with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP 3A4) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increases the risk for colchicine-induced toxic effects, dose adjustments are required. Prophylaxis of gout flares: If the original colchicine dose were 0.6 mg twice daily, 0.3 mg should be given once daily. For an original dose of 0.6 mg daily, the adjusted dose is 0.3 mg every other day.
