You shouldn't force your child to use a potty if she doesn't want to, or if she is not ready to start. Some parents start potty training when their babies are younger than four months. This is done by watching for signs of an imminent pee or poo and catching it in the potty. Boys tend to be ready a few months later than girls. Most parents start the training when their children are between two years and three years old. But there's no official age, and you needn't potty train your toddler at all if you don't want to.
