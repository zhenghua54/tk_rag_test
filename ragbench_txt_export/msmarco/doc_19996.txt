The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction.
