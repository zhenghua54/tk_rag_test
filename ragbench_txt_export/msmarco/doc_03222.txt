Organic litter is particularly hazardous form of litter as it can even lead to a major water pollution and lead to a shortage of drinking water, for instance if there is garbage in a river then the water is no longer safe to drink. Organic litter has been also found to cause algal bloom in certain water bodies. Many litter items are not biodegradable which means that their chemical decomposition takes a very long time and these items can therefore create long-term damage to environment (as this is the case with cigarette butts).
