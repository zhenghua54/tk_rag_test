Medium-chain triglycerides (or MCTs for short) are made up of medium-chain fatty acids. The “medium” refers to the length of their chemical structure: all fats are made up of strings of carbon and hydrogen. Short-chain fats (e.g. butyric acid) have fewer than 6 carbons. Medium-chain fats are in the middle, with 6 to 12. There are three separate fatty acids classified as medium-chain triglycerides: 1  Caproic acid (also called hexanoic acid or C6:0). 2  Caprylic acid (also called octanoic acid or C8:0).
