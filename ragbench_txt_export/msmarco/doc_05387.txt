Occupational therapy focuses on the person wishing to maintain or regain maximum functional ability and quality of life in his daily living and his environment. The terms activity, the person, daily living, environment and quality of life are therefore pivotal for occupational therapy. WWhich activities a person needs in daily living at any one given point in his life and which are of particular importance to him are partly determined by the roles he assumes or has to assume in his environment (e.g. role of a mother, role of an employee). Occupational therapy takes these into account.
