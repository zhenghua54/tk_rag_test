Non-Romantic Love. â€¢ Universal Love. When I say I love you to someone with whom I'm not in a close relationship, what I mean is that I love them in a universal way -- the way I love everyone. In my heart, I love everyone in the sense that I truly want everyone's highest good. I want everyone to flourish and have joy in their lives.
