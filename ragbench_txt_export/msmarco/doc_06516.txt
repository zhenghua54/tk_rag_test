Reviews. That isn’t the name of a new Godzilla movie, as cool as it would be. :grinny: Thermolactyl is a fiber, for a type of ladies and mens thermal underwear. Today, I am reminded of Damart’s thermolactyl on Upstate New York’s traditionally coldest day of the year. My oldest son just informed me that he’s outgrown his long johns (AGAIN). I just found out that I can order Damart clothing ONLINE! Woohoo!! My sons love thermolactyl and Damart makes the BEST thermal underwear ever. Thermolactyl is very “cool” stuff. For many years, we had a Damart outlet factory nearby and we used to get the most AMAZING clothing.
