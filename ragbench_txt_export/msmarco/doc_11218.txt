If anyone receives income support and claims carers allowance then they take the amount out of yr income support so you would be left with 90.50 a fortnight. They dont take any money from DLA as this is yr childs money not yr money. Also would be entitled to housing benefit/council tax benefit too. It took about 5/6 weeks for me to get a letter back saying i was going to be awarded carers allowance. It said that i would get an award letter this month to tell me how much i'll be getting and then will be paid in May.
