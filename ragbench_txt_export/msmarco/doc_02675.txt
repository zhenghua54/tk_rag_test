A body cavity search is a very specific type of police search that involves the search of orifices of the human body. Many people consider these searches to be very intrusive, and they are usually only reserved for very specific situations. Body cavity searches sometimes involve emergency situations where the suspect has swallowed or inserted an object and can no longer retrieve it. In such situations, emergency operations may be needed; these types of situations would not relieve the suspect of criminal liability if they are found with contraband.
