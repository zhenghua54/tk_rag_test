Overview. Bermuda has always considered itself the premier offshore jurisdiction, having successfully attracted many Fortune 500 companies to its shores. Bermuda is the largest market for insurance and reinsurance after London and New York, with a gross premium volume in 1992 of over $15 billion. Bermuda companies which are owned by non-Bermudians are designated as exempted and, as such, must carry on their business outside Bermuda. Only local companies at least 60 per cent owned by Bermudians are allowed to carry on business in Bermuda.
