If you lack the amino acids that combine to form collagen, your body's cells can't produce enough of it. Threonine is an essential amino acid for collagen production. Collagen is an important building block for the skin. It makes up to 30% of the protein of the living body and 70% of the protein that makes up skin. Collagen ensues the cohesion, elasticity and regeneration of skin.
