Rickets is a disease in children that causes the bones to develop softer than normal, resulting in muscle and bone weakness and deformity. Rickets is impaired mineralization of the growth plates of bones. The most common cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D. Rickets is caused by faulty mineralization in the bone-building process. Because vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus are needed to build strong bones, a lack of these substances will affect the bones. Multiple factors can affect vitamin D levels, including the environment, genetics and diet.
