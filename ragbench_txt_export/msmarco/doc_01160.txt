Step 2. Set the pork shoulder on a rack in a shallow roasting pan to allow fat to drip off the meat during roasting. Insert an oven-proof meat thermometer into a meaty section the shoulder roast; avoid placing it near a bone. Step 1. Trim away as much visible fat as you can. A picnic-style pork shoulder contains a significant amount of internal marbling that while adding flavor also increases the amount of saturated fat in the meat. The more fat you cut off before roasting, the less fatty and healthier the meat will be.
