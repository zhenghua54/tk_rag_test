1. The first question a person may ask when they develop a nail fungus infection is how long it will take to get rid of the infection. The duration of a nail fungus infection depends on the severity of the infection, the type of treatment that is used and the general health of the person. These medications are typically taken for three months but it can take up to a year for a new nail to fully grow. Some people use a foot soak for nail fungus infections that is a combination of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.
