Each kidney or ureter is considered a separate primary, unless bilateral involvement is stated to be metastatic from one side to the other (exception: bilateral Wilms tumor of the kidney). The kidneys have two functional areas that are managed and staged independently, the kidney parenchyma and the renal pelvis. The ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder. They are staged the same way as the renal pelvis.
