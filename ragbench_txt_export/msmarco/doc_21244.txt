Although the oldest amber comes from The Baltic, amber has also been found in Mexico and The Dominican Republic. Quaternary Amber can be found in Tanzania. This unique amber is older than copal resin, but younger than Baltic amber, Madagascar, Alaska (derived from cypress trees), Sweden, Germany and Poland. Amber's color can vary depending on the source of the hardened tree resin. For example, the most common golden yellow, white, and ivory colored amber comes from pine trees. Cherry and plum trees produce an amber with more red, orange and brown tones.
