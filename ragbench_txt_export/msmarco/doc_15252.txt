Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes beta-and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain and alpha-and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. MGI mutant phenotypes for SNCA: inferred from 6 alleles. 1  reproductive system phenotype. 2  skeleton phenotype. 3  mortality/aging. 4  endocrine/exocrine gland phenotype. 5  cellular phenotype. 6  cardiovascular system phenotype. 7  growth/size/body phenotype. 8  homeostasis/metabolis
