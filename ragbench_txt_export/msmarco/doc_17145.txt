What to Expect from Klonopin Detoxification. Klonopin withdrawals are different for everyone, though it will likely be intense at the beginning and then they will gradually lessen. Symptoms typically develop within 24 -72 hours and become their worst after about 5-7 days. The average length of Klonopin withdrawal is about six weeks, though in some people certain symptoms can persist for months. The symptoms often run a two-phase course where they seem to get better after a week, but then they intensify the next week.
