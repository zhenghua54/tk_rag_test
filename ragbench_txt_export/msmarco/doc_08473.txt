Butternut squash skin is edible and actually quite healthy as it’s full of fiber and many of the best antioxidants in butternut are found just under the skin. Steaming butternut squash will make the skin quite soft and if you blend it up for a spicy Thai butternut soup like this you won’t even notice it. Once it is halved, pull out the seeds with your fingers and keep them if you’d like to lightly fry them up while the squash is cooking. While raw hulless pumpkin seeds are a lot easier to eat, you can lightly fry butternut squash seeds with their hulls in a little coconut oil and seasoning for a few minutes.
