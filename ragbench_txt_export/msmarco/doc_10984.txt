Sympathetic Pathway Uses Splanchnic nerves, which are preganglionic axons that pass through the sympathetic trunk ganglia without synapsing. These nerves extend from the anterior side of the sympathetic trunk ganglia to the prevertebral ganglia. There, the postganglionic axon then travels to the effector organs. Many visceral effectors have dual innervation, meaning that they are innervated by postganglionic axons from both ANS divisions. The actions of the divisions usually oppose each other, and so they are said to exert antagonistic effects on the same organ.
