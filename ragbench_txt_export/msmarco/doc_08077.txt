1 Lady Capulet replies that Juliet's father is coming, so Juliet ought to tell him she won't marry Paris, if she dares. 2  Enter Capulet and Nurse: 3  Lady Capulet tells Capulet that Juliet has refused to marry Paris. 4  Enraged, Capulet threatens to throw her out of the house if she doesn't change her mind. Juliet asks what the day of joy is. Lady Capulet tells her it's that early on Thursday Paris will make her a joyful bride at St. Peter's Church, but Juliet exclaims, Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, / He shall not make me there a joyful bride (3.5.116-117) .
