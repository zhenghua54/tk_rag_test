In 1889, Daimler and Maybach designed an automobile from the ground up rather than attaching a gasoline engine to a carriage without the horse. In 1885, it was Karl Benz who built his first gasoline car in Mannheim, Germany. Marcus also invented the magento low voltage ignition system that would go into the 4-seat second Marcus car of 1888 and in other subsequent automobiles. Another man who has a claim to the first gasoline car is Etienne Lenoir of France.
