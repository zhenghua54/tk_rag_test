It has a half-life of 30 years, and decays by pure beta decay to a metastable state of barium -137 (137mBa). Barium-137m has a half-life of minutes and is responsible for all of the gamma ray emission. The ground state of barium-137 is stable. These gamma rays can be used, for example, in radiotherapy such as for the treatment of cancer, in food irradation, or in industrial gauges or sensors. Cs-137 is not widely used for industrial radiography as other nuclides, such as cobalt-60 or iridium-192 for example, offer higher radiation output for a given volume.
