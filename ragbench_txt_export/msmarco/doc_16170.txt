The fumes given off by the naphthalene in mothballs kills the larvae. Modern mothballs use a different chemical, called para-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) because naphthalene is flammable. This compound, like naphthalene, gives off a strong odor and can kill moth larvae. This chemical is also used as a disinfectant, often in bathroom garbage cans and in urinals cakes. Mothballs, whether they contain naphthalene or p-DCB, work by giving off fumes.
