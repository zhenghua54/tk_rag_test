An undergraduate degree may either be a 2-year associate's degree or a 4-year bachelor's degree. However, to qualify for a chiropractic doctoral program you need 90 or more undergraduate credits in general education and must also complete courses in organic and inorganic chemistry, physics and biology. While some schools may offer a 5-year program and others offer 3+3 programs that combine a bachelor's degree with a doctorate, most Doctor of Chiropractic degree programs last four years. You need at least 4,200 hours of clinical, lab and classroom study to earn such a degree.
