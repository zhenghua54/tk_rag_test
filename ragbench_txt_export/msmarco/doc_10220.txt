peebee 1: superphosphate isn't organic, and it's too strong for use in growing vegetables organically. A pity, perhaps; my Uncle George used it with excellent results in the 1930s, and 40s. I use soft rock phosphate if and when I need phosphorus. I try to use organic products only. I have been using bone meal in my vegetable garden, usually before planting. I have been looking for an alterative, and noticed in some of the past threads that superphosphate is recommended.
