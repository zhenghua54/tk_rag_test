Only tiny amounts of toxins and waste products, like the ammonia and urea mentioned above, are found in sweat. Sweat itself has no odor. The smelly effect is the fault of apocrine glands located in the groin, armpits and other hairy body parts. Sweat glands in the skin also play active roles in the excretory system, or the organs and glands that flush out toxins and excess minerals from the body. Dead skin cells are a form of bodily waste that facilitates the growth of new epidermal cells.
