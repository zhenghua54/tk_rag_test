This process is called homologation, derived from the Greek word homologeo, meaning “to agree.”. Homologation is a prerequisite for qualification, not a substitute for it. A car might be properly homologated and still be disqualified for having non-homologated components or modifications forbidden by the rules. Homologation seems to be the best way to ensure racing efforts follow through on their promise that racing developments can help make better street cars. In the best cases, tweaks are made to the design of the base car to help the race version: things like engine configurations or chassis design.
