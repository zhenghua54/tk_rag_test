I tried to understand the lifecycle of chickweed to see if it would die off in the summer and allow my grass to thicken in the fall. Instead I was told to pull it out before it grows or get a thick lawn. So thanks again. Anyway, I have a relatively large chickweed invasion. I tried pulling some out with a thatch rake and it seemed to thin it out, but I'm not sure if it just allowed the chickweed to grow better also. The grass is growing pretty well in most of these areas so I guess my question is...
