Definition. Subsurface runoff is the water that infiltrates in the vadose zone (unsaturated zone), from rain, snowmelt, or other sources, and moves laterally towards the streams. Vadose zone extends from the top of the ground surface to the water table. It is one of the major components in the water cycle.
