1 Initial adult vaccination (and for puppies older than 16 weeks of age) ideally consists of two vaccines three to four weeks apart, though one vaccine is considered protective. 2  All dogs should receive one vaccine one year after the final puppy vaccination. 1 Puppies should receive a minimum of three vaccinations between 6 and 16 weeks old, no more frequently than every three to four weeks with the final dose at 14 to 16 weeks.
