Can you get what you want? The small claims court is a “court of limited jurisdiction.” This means that the court cannot award more than $7,500,even if your claim is worth more. You will have to waive your right to the amount that exceeds $7,500, or you willhave to bring your claim in a different court. The fee that you will have to pay de-pends on the amount of your claim. The court clerk can tell you how much to pay for the filing fee. Service The Small Claims Rules set out the procedure for serving the complaint on the defendant.
