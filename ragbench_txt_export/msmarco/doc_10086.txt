Best Answer: Proteins are linear polymers formed by linking the a-carboxyl group of one amino acid to the a-amino group of another amino acid with a peptide bond (also called an amide bond). The formation of a dipeptide from two amino acids is accompanied by the loss of a water molecule (Figure 3.18).
