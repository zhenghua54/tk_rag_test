These deliverables are not presented to the customer. For example, a list of customer accounts is a deliverable which is a work product used to test the billing system. The primary deliverables that meet project objectives represent performance obligations and are, therefore, a basis or revenue recognition. Project leadership can present one or more deliverables to the customer during the term of the project or just prior to its completion. The project scope statement describes each deliverable and the related acceptance criteria.
