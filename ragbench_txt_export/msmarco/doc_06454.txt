A graduate program in prosthetics prepares students for entry-level clinical positions as prosthetists. Prosthetists work closely with patients to design the right prosthetic for their needs by performing consultations, fittings and an assessment of the finished product. Additional topics covered in the bachelor's degree program include applied kinesiology, the study of how the body's joints and muscles affect a patient's gait. These courses allow prosthetics majors to examine how a prosthetic's components compensate for the loss of a limb by assisting with balance or shock absorption.
