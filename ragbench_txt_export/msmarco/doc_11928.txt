Poured foundation walls can typically be constructed much more quickly than concrete block based foundations, thus saving both time and money. The complete process of installing concrete forms, pouring the concrete, and breaking the forms down can take as little as 2 or 3 partial days of work. Poured concrete foundations are usually 6-10 inches thick and joint-free, unlike concrete block walls. Consequently they are considered to produce stronger and drier foundation walls, critical for basement walls. Standard concrete blocks contain hollow cells designed to support rebar / steel reinforcing rods, as well as poured concrete/mortar, to maximize wall strength. Besides the standard size concrete block there are a number of alternative sizes, shapes, textures and color tones to choose from.
