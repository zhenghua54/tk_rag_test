You won't believe these 10 facts about people. Dielectric grease is a non-conductive, silicone-based grease that's designed to seal out moisture and prevent corrosion on electrical connectors. It also disrupts the flow of electrical current, which makes it good for lubricating and sealing the rubber parts of electrical connectors. Post 14. I've watched marina electricians dab dielectric grease into the wire hole on crimp-on terminals, and on the stripped end of the wire that is going into the aforementioned crimp-on terminal, then the wire and the terminal are crimped together.
