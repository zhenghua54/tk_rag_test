DUI costs vary by state, but a first offense, without any injury, property damage or other complications, will likely range between $5,000 and $25,000. If you were involved in an accident or are a repeat offender, these figures can increase considerably. Predictably, costs will increase for more serious offenses  for example, DUI/Manslaughter (a 2nd degree felony) in Florida carries a $10,000 fine 2. In some cases, participation in drug and alcohol programs may be accepted by the court in lieu of paying fines.
