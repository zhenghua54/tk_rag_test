The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the reflex connectivity of the paraspinal muscles by the application of a tap to individual muscles and the observation of reflexes both homonymously and heteronymously on ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the trunk. Inhibitory responses in contralateral muscles. In contrast to the excitatory responses in ipsilateral paraspinal muscles, those observed in the contralateral muscles were inhibitory (Figs. 4, ​,5).5). The latencies for the contralateral inhibitory reflexes ranged from 20.9 ± 0.5 to 22.6 ± 1.4 ms (Fig.
