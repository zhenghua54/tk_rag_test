If you plan on purchasing a German Shepherd Dog from a breeder you should expect the price range to be from 200 - 500 pounds... I presume you mean buy. Well if you got one fr â€¦ om the shelter it would only cost 100-300 pounds and breeders only generally sell puppies. A GSD trained to guide the blind, for example, is worth over $30,000.   Other contributors have added:   It can vary from 400-600 euro. when i got my German Shepard he cost 400.
