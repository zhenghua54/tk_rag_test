RouterOS supports many applications used by Internet service providers, for example OSPF, BGP, Multiprotocol Label Switching (VPLS/MPLS), OpenFlow. The product is supported by Mikrotik through a forum and a wiki, providing assorted and thematic examples of configurations. MikroTik routers and their operating system were chosen because of their low cost, flexibility, the fact that the system already had a substantial user base in Mali, and had a user interface deemed superior to other products.
