Range of Motion is the measurement of movement around a specific joint or body part. Let's say a soccer player named Jane has torn a ligament in her knee and is working with a physical therapist to try and regain her range of motion. There are three primary types of exercises specific to range of motion. Passive range of motion is typically practiced on a joint that is inactive. The physical therapist may use this exercise on a client who is paralyzed or unable to mobilize a specific joint.
