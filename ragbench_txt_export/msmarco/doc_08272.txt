Preston is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, nine kilometres north from Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the City of Darebin. At the 2011 Census, Preston had a population of 29,925. Parcels of land between 300 acres (in the southern area) and over 1000 acres (in the north) were all sold during the Melbourne 'land boom' sales of the late 1830s. The first permanent white resident was Samuel Jeffrey in 1841 and from him the area's early name was Irishtown.
