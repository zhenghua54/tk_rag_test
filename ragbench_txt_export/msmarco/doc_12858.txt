to Stay in Phuket. Something that often takes first time visitors to the island of Phuket by surprise is its size. Its about 50km long by 20km wide and, while there are no really bad areas to stay, some people find that they've booked a hotel too far away from the things that interest them. Near the southern tip of Phuket is the pleasant little tourist village of Rawai. It has a very peaceful atmosphere compared to Patong but still posesses a few restaurants and bars with seaside dining on fresh locally-caught seafood being particularly popular.
