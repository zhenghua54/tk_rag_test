1 The risk of reproductive cancers (ovarian, uterine, mammarian) for an unspayed female rabbit stands at is virtually eliminated by spaying your female rabbit. 2  Your neutered male rabbit will live longer as well, given that he wonâ€™t be tempted to fight with other animals (rabbits, cats, etc.) due to his sexual aggression. Spay/neuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country. The low end of the range can be as inexpensive as $50-75 (often in spay/neuter clinics), while vets in major metropolitan areas, where rents and labor costs are very high, often charge several hundred dollars.
