NEW YORK (CNN) -- Pepsi-Cola announced Friday that the labels of its Aquafina brand bottled water will be changed to make it clear the product is tap water. Its aim was to challenge the marketing muscle of the bottled water corporations and to galvanize support for our public water systems around the country, she said. The campaign focused on Nestle, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
