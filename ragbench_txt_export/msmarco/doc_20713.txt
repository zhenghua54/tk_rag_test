Next. Genetic engineering can be used to create organisms that produce large amounts of useful substances-for example, bacteria can be engineered to produce human insulin to treat diabetics. Genetic engineering can also be used to create and store DNA fingerprints, which can be used for identification purposes. Bacteria [bacterium: A type of single-celled microorganism.] can be genetically engineered (genetically modified) to produce useful human proteins [protein: Organic compound made up of amino acid molecules.
