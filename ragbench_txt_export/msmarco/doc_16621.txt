Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is concrete containing fibrous material which increases its structural integrity. The concept of using fibers as reinforcement is not new. Fibers have been used as reinforcement since ancient times. Historically, horsehair was used in mortar and straw in mud bricks. In the 1900s, asbestos fibers were used in concrete.
