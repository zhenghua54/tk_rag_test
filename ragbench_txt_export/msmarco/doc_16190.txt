1 Position an aluminum foil tent over the turkey. 2  Place turkey in the oven, and pour 2 cups turkey stock into the bottom of the roasting pan. 3  Baste all over every 30 minutes with the juices on the bottom of the pan. 4  Whenever the drippings evaporate, add stock to moisten them, about 1 to 2 cups at a time. 1 Remove aluminum foil after 2 1/2 hours. 2  Roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the meaty part of the thigh reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 4 hours. 3  Transfer the turkey to a large serving platter, and let it stand for at least 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
