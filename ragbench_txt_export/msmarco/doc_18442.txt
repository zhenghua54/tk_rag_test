Milonguero Style Tango. The Milongueros are the tango dancers who have spent their lives in the milongas of Buenos Aires. The last of this lineage of dancers from the Golden Era of tango (1935 to 1952) are now in their eighties. They are social dancers who developed their dance within the limits of crowded milongas. As such, their figures are compact, easily navigated, and safe for dancers nearby. For the most part they dance chest to chest in a close, intimate embrace. Their dance, based on walking, was developed by regular people, not professional dancers, and so by its nature is accessible to everyone. Most milongueros do not identify their tango as that associated with flash or posturing.
