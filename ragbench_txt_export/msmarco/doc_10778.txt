The Black Mamba is native to Africa. While it may not be the most venomous snake in the world (one bite may only deliver enough venom to kill 10 people), it is still arguably the most dangerous snake in the world for other reasons. It is the fastest snake on earth, able to travel as fast as 20 km/h. The rattlesnake is actually a type of viper, and is quite venomous. The most dangerous snakes in this species are the young Eastern Diamondbacks. When treated promptly, fewer than 4% of rattlesnake bites are fatal, but when left untreated, all bites are potentially lethal.
