A motor unit consists of one somatic efferent (motor) neuron and all of the muscle fibers (cells) that it innervates. In the figure to the right, two motor units are illustrated diagrammatically. Notice that after an efferent axon enters the muscle, it branches and forms synapses with a number of muscle fibers.
