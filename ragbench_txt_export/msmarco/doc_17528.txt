The external work done on an elastic member in causing it to distort from its unstressed state is transformed into strain energy which is a form of potential energy. The strain energy in the form of elastic deformation is mostly recoverable in the form of mechanical work. For example, the heat of combustion of cyclopropane is higher than that of propane for each additional CH2 unit.
