Origins of Marble. Marble is a metamorphic rock resulting from regional or at times contact metamorphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks, either limestone or dolostone. This metamorphic process causes a complete recrystallization of the original rock into an interlocking mosaic of calcite and/or dolomite crystals. Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make reconstituted or cultured marble. Places named after the stone include Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York and the town of Marble, Minnesota. The Elgin Marbles are marble sculptures taken from the Parthenon to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.
