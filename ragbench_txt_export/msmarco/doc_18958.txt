Vinegar Bath Soak. Men and women experiencing external yeast infection symptoms such as itching can find relief with a vinegar bath soak. Pour 1 cup of vinegar into a hot bath and soak for 20 to 30 minutes. When repeated daily, external yeast is killed quickly, as reported by Home Remedies for Yeast Infections. Infants can even get yeast infections as diaper rashes. At-home treatments for yeast infections are available as over-the-counter products in drugstores, and home remedies using products as simple as household vinegar have been shown to be effective in eliminating yeast infections.
