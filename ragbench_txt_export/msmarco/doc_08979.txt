Here is how to pay employees in QuickBooks. In the Employees section click the pay employees option, and you will see the window showing the Employees Tab on the Left Side, Transactions Tab, and the Payroll Tab. Under the Payroll Tab you’ll see Schedules, where you can schedule an employee, whether bi-weekly or weekly. Using QuickBooks Pro 2013 you can easily pay your employees, schedule payroll, and track paychecks. But if you do not sign up for any QuickBooks Basic Features, your tax tables will not be updated automatically so you will have to enter them and make sure that you’ve entered the correct ones.
