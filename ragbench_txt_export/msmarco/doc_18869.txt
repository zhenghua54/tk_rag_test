Tell your provider if you have had a boil or carbuncle longer than 2 weeks or if you have boils often. If you have boils often, you may have lab tests of your blood or urine. These tests can check for conditions that might make you more likely to have the sores, such as diabetes or kidney or liver disease. For treatment at home you can: 1  Wash your hands and then put a warm, moist cloth on the boil or carbuncle for 10 to 15 minutes at least 3 times a day. 2  This helps the boil come to a head and drain on its ownâ€”the safe way to drain. 3  Once the boil begins to drain, you will have less pressure and pain.
