Per the IRS (talked to them myself today), tax returns and related documents are destroyed after 7 years. After that point, you can obtain a transcript, or summary of the li â€¦ ne items in your return, but not the actual return or any of the attachments (like W2s and the like). Usuallyit is three years from the date the tax return was due or tax return was filed with the IRS, or two years from the date the tax was paid to the IRS, whichever is later. This is the time period in which the IRS can question your tax return; typically three years after it is filed.
