Throughout the lymph node's interior are a series of street-like channels called sinuses that help guide the flow of lymph from the afferent lymphatic vessels, through the cortex and medulla, and finally to the efferent lymphatic vessels at the hilum. The lymph flowing into a lymph node carries with it the bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, debris, and other potentially dangerous agents that have filtered into the lymphatic vessels from your bloodstream and tissues. Lymph enters a lymph node through an afferent lymphatic vessel.
