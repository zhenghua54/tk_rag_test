What is the perfect outside temperature for the human body? It musn't be too cold, so you should be ok with a tee shirt and shorts but it mustn't be too hot. Of course, humidity is also a factor, and that can change the range of comfortable temperatures. However, generally speaking, 73 or so is probably as perfect as you could expect. Interestingly, many parts of coastal California experience temperatures like this during much of the year.
