In total, 50 million tons of palm oil is produced annually, supplying over 30% of the worldâ€™s vegetable oil production. This single vegetable oil is found in approximately 40-50% of household products in countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and England. Today, palm oil is grown throughout Africa, Asia, North America, and South America, with 85% of all palm oil globally produced and exported from Indonesia and Malaysia; but most of the time not using sustainable measures. Demand for palm oil has increased rapidly in recent decades.
