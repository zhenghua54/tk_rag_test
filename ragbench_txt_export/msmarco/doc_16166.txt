To find the best rates for oral examinations, patients usually get quotes from several dentists, asking for a comprehensive breakdown of the fees and the estimated total costs. The average cost for a oral surgery is between $149 and $240+ . However, with a discount dental plan, you could save on average 15% - 50% for the same procedure. Costs will vary depending on where you live and your needs.
