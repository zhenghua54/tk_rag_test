Essentially, Basel III and related measures by national and supranational regulators will force the banks to maintain a much bigger capital base – in effect, a foundation stone of solid assets designed to withstand sudden market disruption. All these factors combined to trigger what has become known as the Great Recession, the most severe economic crisis in 80 years. Thus Basel III, one of the biggest responses to crisis, is specifically designed to make sure that the banking sector supports and underpins the world’s economies rather than threatens them.
