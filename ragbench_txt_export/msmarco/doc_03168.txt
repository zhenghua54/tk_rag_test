In 2011, social workers averaged $54,220 a year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). But high salaries can sometimes skew the average, and median wage is often a better indication of a case workerâ€™s earnings. Half of all social workers earned less than $53,900 a year. As with any job, employers affect salaries, and a case worker is no exception. Those working directly for social services, where many welfare case workers are employed, earned a median of $53,000 a year; while those working for other government agencies made $66,300 a year.
