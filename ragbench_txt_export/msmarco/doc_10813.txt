Concrete surfaces last a long time, but the time comes when they need replacing or revitalizing. Fortunately, you probably don't need to replace a dingy looking concrete driveway or patio. A more cost-effective way to give a concrete surface a new lease on life is with concrete resurfacing. Concrete resurfacing is the process of applying a thin coat of concrete over an existing concrete surface. Since every job is different, the only way to find out how much concrete resurfacing will cost you is to get quotes from concrete resurfacers in your area and compare them. Before you do, though, have a look at our paving design ideas photo pages.
