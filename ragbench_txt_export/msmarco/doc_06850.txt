Glowstone Blocks (formerly known as Lightstone, Brittle Gold, Brightstone, Hell's Stone or Brimstone) are golden blocks that glow indefinitely. It can only be found naturally in The Nether, generating on the undersides of Netherrack, commonly near lava, and forms unusual coral-like stalactites. 1 A useful tactic for reaching clusters of Glowstone Blocks that are very high up is to redirect a Ghast's fireball at it. 2  This is only recommended if the cluster itself is over ground though, else the resulting dust could easily fall into the lava sea below.
