2 The subspecies name Yersinia pseudotuberculosis subsp. pseudotuberculosis (Pfeiffer 1889) Bercovier et al. 1981 is automatically created by the valid publication of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis subsp. pestis (Lehmann and Neumann 1896) Bercovier et al. 1981 [Rule 40d (formerly Rule 46)]. Warning: In the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature, an arrow (â†’) only indicates the sequence of valid publication of names and does not mean that the last name in the sequence must be used (see: Introduction).
