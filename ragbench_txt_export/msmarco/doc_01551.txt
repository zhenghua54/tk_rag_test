There is the Petrarchian (Italian sonnet), which is the oldest one; the Spensarian sonnet; and the Shakespearean (English or Elizabethan) sonnet. True sonnets have 14 lines, but the forms of the three sonnets named here differ. The Shakespearean sonnet has three quartets and a couplet, and a rhyme scheme of abab,cdcd,efef,gg. The sonnet you will most often see when you study literature in a high school English class is the Shakespearean sonnet.
