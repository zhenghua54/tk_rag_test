If you choose to withdraw money from your RRSP under the HBP, you have to repay it within 15 years. Generally, you have to repay 1/15 of the total amount you withdrew for each year of your repayment period. Your repayment period starts the second year following the year you make your withdrawal. If you need to withdraw money from your RRSP, you can do so, but keep in mind you will be taxed on the amount you withdraw. There are only two exceptions to this rule: buying your first home, and borrowing from your RRSP to further your education.
