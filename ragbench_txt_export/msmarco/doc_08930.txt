Growing Tomatoes from Seed: It really is not difficult to grow tomatoes from seed but does take a little bit of planning. Start the seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks prior to the last frost date in your area (refer to the Frost Pages). Plant about 1/4 inch deep, in flats or small pots using sterile seed starting material.
