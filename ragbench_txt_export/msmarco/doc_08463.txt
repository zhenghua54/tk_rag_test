The first step to becoming a Secret Service agent is to excel in school and avoid getting into any trouble with the law. Because so many people want to become Secret Service agents and because of the sensitive nature of the work, any criminal activity on your record disqualifies you as an applicant. To apply for the Secret Service, you must be an American citizen between 21 and 37 years old, with uncorrected eyesight no worse than 20/60. If your eyesight is not 20/20 uncorrected, it must be correctable to 20/20. You must also possess a current driver's license. Related Reading: Secret Service Vs. Pay Grade Requirements.
