When a metallic conductor enclosure is used as an Equipment Grounding Circuit Conductor it must have continuity as well as the required conductivity to pass enough current to facilitate the operation of the overcurrent devices. In the second category we could include all industrial plants where a metallic Equipment Grounding Circuit sized per Table 250-122, must be run parallel with and within the conductor enclosure so as to ensure continuity if that circuit is broken owing to corrosion sooner or later.
