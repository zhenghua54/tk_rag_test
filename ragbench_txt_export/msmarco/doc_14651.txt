And opposed to five years ago, when out-of-state kids saw a 22 percent acceptance rate at Berkeley—compared with in-staters' 25 percent—the trend is looking good for out-of-state applicants. At the University of Illinois, in-state students pay annual tuition of $14,414. Their out-of-state roommates pay $28,556. At the University of Michigan, state residents pay $12,634 in annual tuition. Non-Michigan residents pay $37,782.
