Plant-like protists make their own food, and many have cell walls made of cellulose. Animal-like protists cannot make their own food and ingest it. Some animal-like protests have “shells,” called tests, which are made of silica or calcium carbonate. Other animal-like protists lack a cell wall or protective test.
