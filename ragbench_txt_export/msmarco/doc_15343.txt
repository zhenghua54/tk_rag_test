The capillaries feed into larger vessels called lympathic vessels and these have smooth muscle their walls and they pass through lymph nodes. These vessels eventually feed into two large ducts, the thoracic and the tracheal, which empty into the jugular veins. The smaller vessels generally travel with blood vessels and nerves. Valves in the vessels prevent back flow and keep the flow of lymph unidirectional. As there is no central pump the movement of lymph is largely dependant on skeletal muscular activity.
