For example, if you make $1,465 per month, the SSA will subtract $65 (to get $1,400) and then half of the amount over $65 (to get $700). That $700 is your countable income from work, and it will be subtracted from your monthly SSI payment (which is $733 without a state supplement). The Social Security Administration (SSA) defines a substantial amount of work, which it calls substantial gainful activity (SGA), as earning $1,090 a month from working (in 2015). Therefore, if you are earning this much from work when you apply for benefits, you will be denied.
