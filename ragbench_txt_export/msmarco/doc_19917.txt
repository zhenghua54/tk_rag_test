10-15 years. The Meerkat (Suricata suricatta) is a small member of the mongoose family, which is part of the Feliformia (cat-like carnivores) order. They are also refered to as suricates, s lender-tailed meerkats and grey meerkats. Also, in Dutch 'kat' means cat and 'meer' means lake, and so 'meerkat' also refers to 'lake cat'. As the species are not cats nor do they occur near lakes, the word 'meerkat' is further underlined as being adapted to a misidentified animal.
