1 The gateway to Lost Kennywood is a one-third scale replica of Luna Park's main entrance which spells Pittsburgh with no 'H' , because in 1905â€“1909, Pittsburgh's name was spelled that way. 2  Volcano Valley was created in the park in 2003 for the addition of a new ride that year, King Kahuna. Kennywood is approximately 8 miles (13 km) from Downtown Pittsburgh, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. The park is along Pennsylvania Route 837, known as Kennywood Boulevard as it passes through the borough.
