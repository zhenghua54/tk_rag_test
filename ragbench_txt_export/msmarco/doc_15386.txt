Granted, we have allowed it to happen, but we cannot deny the. overwhelming influence of the standards of technology on Christianity. Fourth, we have become a culturally obese society because of the availability, ease of. use, convenience, and affordability of technology. Keep the welfare of the souls of people at the forefront ofwhat we do, recognizing that they donâ€™t always need technology but they do needredemption provided by a loving Savior, Jesus Christ. Christians need to quit letting technology define them or set the standards for theChurch.
