For the typical rehab experience lasting 30 days, this can mean a significant time away from work, family, and personal obligations. With an outpatient program like the IOP offered by The Counseling Center at Freehold, you continue to live at your own home. You remain in control of your own life. You can still go to work or get a job, and begin rebuilding your personal life, with the help and support you receive from the program.
