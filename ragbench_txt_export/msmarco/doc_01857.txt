The tallest of all trees that grow in a temperate deciduous forest biome is the Sequoia. They can be up to 275 feet tall and more than 95 feet in circumference. They are found in areas of California in the United States. However, the canopy is dense rather than thick like in a rainforest. The humidity is also a factor in this type of biome. It ranges from 60% to 80% all the time. The largest temperate deciduous forest biome is found in the Northern part of Russian and into Scandinavia.
