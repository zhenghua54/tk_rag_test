The Coriolis effect (also called the Coriolis force) is defined as the apparent deflection of objects (such as airplanes, wind, missiles, and ocean currents) moving in a straight path relative to the earth's surface. In addition to the speed of the earth’s rotation and latitude, the faster the object itself is moving, the more deflection there will be. The direction of deflection from the Coriolis effect depends on the object’s position on Earth.
