About Unitarian Universalism. The national Unitarian Universalist Association was created in 1961 by the merger of Unitarianism and Universalism, both strong Christian movements through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The American Unitarian Association helped rescue Jews and others escaping Nazi Germany at the beginning of WWII. The Unitarians formed a Service Committee in 1940. The Universalists helped rescue Jews from Holland and formed their Service Committee in 1945.
