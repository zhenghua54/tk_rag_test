Both Teams are allowed 5 time outs in high school basketball: 3 – 60 second timeouts and 2 – 30 second time outs. The 60 second timeouts many times are called full timeouts by many basketball people. But there is no such thing as a full time out, as officials don’t call a half a full timre out on a 30 second timeout. Any additional time outs will result in a technical foul.
