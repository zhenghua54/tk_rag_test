I am often asked how long it takes quail eggs to hatch. The incubation period for bobwhite quail eggs is 23-24 days. Here is a link to information on incubating bobwhite quail eggs http://www.farmingfriends.com/incubating-bobwhite-quail-eggs/. The incubation period for Coturnix (Japanese) quail eggs is 17 days. Usually the hen will keep sitting if she thinks the other eggs are fertile and I have read that the hen can feel movement in the eggs so will keep sitting. Quail eggs take about 17 days to hatch and hen eggs take 21 days.
