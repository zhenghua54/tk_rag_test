Also check if the coconut oil has been partially hydrogenated. Partial hydrogenation is a food processing technique used mainly to prolong the shelf life and stability of vegetable oils. However, the process destroys some of the good fats and antioxidants that would otherwise be present in coconut oil. Heating an oil above its smoke point can produce dangerous byproducts, such as toxic fumes, free radicals and trans fatty acids. Do not worry if your coconut oil started out liquid and turns solid or vice versa -- both are safe to use in cooking and to eat.
