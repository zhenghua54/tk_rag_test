Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park, or wilderness. An early form of landscape poetry, Shanshui poetry, developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D. Shanshui poetry (or Shanshui chi, traditional Chinese: 山水詩; simplified Chinese: 山水诗 lit. mountains and rivers poetry) refers to the movement in poetry, influenced by the shan shui (landscape) painting style.
