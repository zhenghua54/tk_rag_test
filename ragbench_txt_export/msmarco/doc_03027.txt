Four species are now covered, with help from well-known UK Parrotfinch (and Waxbill) breeder Graham Lee. Breeding Blue-faced Parrot Finches, Red-headed Parrot Finches and Tricolor or Forbes Parrot Finches is relatively straightforward. Pin-tailed Parrot Finches may be less easy but they are not difficult. A robust, easy-to-care-for bird (with a nice little song), which is freely available in the UK. Not suited to colony breeding, unlike the Pin-tailed Parrot Finch. However, unlike several other parrotfinches, it is a good parent-rearing bird.
