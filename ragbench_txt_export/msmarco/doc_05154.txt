For women who have short, thin or brittle eyelashes and who can afford the initial cost of permanent eyelash extension surgery, then this is the best option compared to false eyelashes, mascara and semi-permanent eyelashes. You will literally have permanent long eyelashes 24/7, 365 days a year at no extra cost! The answer is not only yes but the eyelash is as natural as your own. Once you undergo the operation to have permanent eyelash extension surgery, you know that it is a one off cost. It must be remembered that the cost is quite high, ranging from $800 to $1000, depending on where you go to get it done.
