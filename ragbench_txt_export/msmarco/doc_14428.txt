GENCODE is a scientific project in genome research and part of the ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) scale-up project. The GENCODE consortium was initially formed as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE project to identify and map all protein-coding genes within the ENCODE regions (approx. 1% of Human genome). The APPRIS server has been used in the context of the scale up of the ENCODE project to annotate the Human genome but APPRIS is being used for other species (e.g. mouse, rat and zebrafish). The pipeline is made up of separate modules that combine protein structure and function information and evolutionary evidence.
