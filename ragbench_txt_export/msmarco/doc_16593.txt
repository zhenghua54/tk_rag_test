by John McCrae, May 1915. In Flanders fields the poppies blow. Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky. The larks, still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago. We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie. In Flanders fields.
