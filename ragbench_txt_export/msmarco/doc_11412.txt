The uterus may be the strongest muscle by weight in the human body. At the time when an infant is delivered, the human uterus weighs about 40 oz (1.1 kg). During childbirth, the uterus exerts 25 to 100 lbf (100 to 400 N) of downward force with each contraction. From a medical point of view the muscle usually quoted as being the strongest in the body is the masseter, the muscle which closes your jaw (it's the one that sticks out the side of your jaw when you clench your teeth). I have no idea why so many people on here have said tongue but that is complete nonsense.
