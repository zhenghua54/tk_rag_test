1 For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket cost for an emergency room visit typically consists of a copay, usually $50-$150 or more, which often is waived if the patient is admitted to the hospital. 2  Depending on the plan, costs might include coinsurance of 10% to 50%. 1 At Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a low-level emergency room visit costs about $220, including hospital charge and doctor fee, with the uninsured discount, while a moderate-level visit costs about $610 and a high-level visit about $1,400. 2  Services, diagnostic tests and laboratory fees add to the final bill.
