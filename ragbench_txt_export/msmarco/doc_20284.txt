Alligator's colors range from charcoal grey to black with a creamish to yellow banding. In older Alligators, this banding may no longer be seen/and or will become invisible. They eat whatever will fit into their mouths, just like an alligator. Gars eat alligators, and alligators can eat gars. An â€¦ alligator will attack something bigger than it can eat in one sitting and sink it to the bottom and store it. A gar is a fish, and as such they are mobile and snatch what they can eat and run.
