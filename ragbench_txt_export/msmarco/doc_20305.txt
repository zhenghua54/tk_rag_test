Igneous rock is formed when magma cools and solidifies, it may do this above or below the Earth's surface. Magma can be forced into rocks, blown out in volcanic explosions or forced to the surface as lava. The atoms and molecules of melted minerals are what make up magma. Tuff is a rock formed from volcanic ash. The upper section of the Earth's crust is made up of around 95% igneous rock.
