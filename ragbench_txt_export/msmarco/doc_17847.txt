The medical term “arthrotomy” means “cutting into a joint.” Also known as a synosteotomy, this procedure can be performed for a variety of reasons, usually as part of a larger surgery that is intended to address a problem inside the joint or an issue with one or more of the bones which articulates at the joint. Most arthrotomy incisions are covered by a sterile dressing for a few days to a week after surgery. Orthopedic surgeons must carefully review a patient's x-ray prior to performing an arthrotomy. An arthrotomy will likely be performed by an orthopedic surgeon.
