Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add about 1/4 of the marinated chicken cubes — don't crowd the pan, or the chicken will steam instead of brown. Cook, flipping after 2-3 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through, and transfer to a clean bowl or plate. Bring the water, lime juice and lemon juice to a boil in a small (1 ½ to 2 quart) saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt and stir to dissolve, then stir in the rice. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook without stirring or uncovering the pot for about 20 minutes, until the rice is fluffy and has absorbed the liquid.
