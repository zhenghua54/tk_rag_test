Best Answer: The secret to ribs is low & slow....cooking at a low temperature, for a (very) long time. Ribs are among the cuts of meat that contain lots of connective tissue, along with the regualr meat and fat. But if you're using a slow cooker/crockpot, cut the rack/racks of ribs into sets of 1 or 2 bones, apply your flavoring, and cook them in the slow cooker (on LOW setting) for anywhere from 6 to 8 hours. The time will vary depending on the type of cooker you're using, and also on the size & quantity of ribs.
