To help envision a DPS in practice, the list of suppliers is essentially created like a PQQ stage, then several lots replace the ITT stage. An example use of a dynamic purchasing system is a purchase of taxi routes through a city. The system itself will create the list of suppliers who are able to provide the service and suppliers submit indicative bids for the main project. In a full tender however, the contract would be awarded to one or a small number of suppliers, who would therefore not necessarily be the most appropriate for each area within the contract. The commonly cited disadvantage of DPS is that it must be an open and electronic process.
