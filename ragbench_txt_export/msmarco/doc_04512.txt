Measure the pond outline to determine how much liner you will need. To do this, determine how deep you want your pond to be and double this number: for example, double a 4-foot pond to 8 feet. Then add the width and the amount of the doubled depth, plus 2 feet for overlap, and do the same for the height. The resulting numbers will be the size liner you need. Remove the grass from the pond area using a flat shovel, going about 6 inches outside of the perimeter you drew. Dig out the pond, going approximately 2 inches below the depth you need for your pond to make room for settlement. Remove any roots or sharp stones from the hole, as these can damage your liner.
