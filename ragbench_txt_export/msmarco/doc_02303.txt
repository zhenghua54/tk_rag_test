Galvanized steel is steel that has gone through a chemical process to keep it from corroding. The steel gets coated in layers of zinc oxide because this protective metal does not get rusty as easily. The coating also gives the steel a more durable, hard to scratch finish that many people find attractive.d. This process, known as hot-dipped galvanization, is one of the most common methods of making galvanized steel, but it's not the only one. Continuous sheet galvanizing runs a steel sheet or wire through molten zinc; it's also a form of hot-dipping, but leaves a thinner layer of the protective metal.
