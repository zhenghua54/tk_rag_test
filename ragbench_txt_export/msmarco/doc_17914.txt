Cooking the Crab is the easy bit. 1. Using the largest saucepan/fish kettle you have, half fill with fresh water and add plenty of salt. We use half a cup to a gallon of water (150g to 4.5 litres) and bring to a vigorous boil. 2. Drop the crab in and bring back to the boil. 3. When the water comes back to the boil, start timing.
