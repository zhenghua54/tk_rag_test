The Janjaweed (Arabic : janjawīd of unclear etymology but ostensibly formed from the local dialectal Arabic words for man or spirit, gun and  horse ; also transliterated Janjawid) are a militia that operate in Darfur, western Sudan, and eastern Chad. The majority of Darfur's Arabs, the Baggara confederation, began their presence in the war over grazing territory, and remain involved. In 1999–2000, faced with threats of insurgencies in Western and Northern Darfur, Khartoum 's security armed the Janjaweed forces.
