The difference boils down to UnTranslated Regions. A CDS or coding sequence is the part of a transcript that is actually translated into protein. Therefore a CDS will (almost) always start with an AUG codon and stop at one of the three STOP codons (UAA,UGA,UAG). The CDS of the gene depicted in image above will only contain the ATG, the STOP and the two green regions (exons). The cDNA will contain all that and, in addition, the two UTRs.
