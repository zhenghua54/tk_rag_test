1 Metallic bonding refers to the interaction between the delocalised electrons and the metal nuclei. 2  The physical properties of metals are the result of the delocalisation of the electrons involved in metallic bonding. 3  The physical properties of solid metals are: The strength of the metallic bond depends on the. 1  number of electrons in the delocalised 'sea' of electrons. ( 2 More delocalised electrons results in a stronger bond and a higher melting point.). 3  packing arrangement of the metal atoms.
