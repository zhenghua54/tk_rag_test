Aerobic respiration requires oxygen in order to generate energy molecule ATP, where as an anaerobic respiration synthesize ATP by using the electron transport chain, with inorganic molecules other than oxygen. Anaerobic Respiration is typically referred to as fermentation and no oxygen is used in the process. In the process of Yeast fermentation or anaerobic respiration, the most sugars are broken to yield ethanol and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration on the other hand, almost all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms are solely dependent upon a continuous supply of oxygen molecules to sustain life.
