SIDS is the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under 1 year of age. SIDS is sometimes called crib death because the death occurs when a baby is sleeping in a crib. It is one of the leading causes of death in babies from 1 month to 1 year of age, occurring most often between 2 and 4 months of age.
