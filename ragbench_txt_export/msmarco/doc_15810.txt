The fee simple estate is also called estate in fee simple or fee-simple title, sometimes simply freehold in England and Wales. From the start of the Norman period, when feudalism was introduced to England, the tenant or holder of a fief could not alienate (sell) it from the possession of his overlord. If previous grantors of a fee simple estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder with full possessory rights and obligations now and in the future.
