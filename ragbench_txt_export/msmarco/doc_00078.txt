Taking Care of Business Crealkiller Says: the lyrics on a website i found says its this: Chorus: R-E-S-P-E-C-T Find out what it means to me R-E-S-P-E-C-T Take care, TC â€¦ B so i doubt TCB is taking care of business it wouldn't make sense to take care, taking care of business. 1 person found this useful.
