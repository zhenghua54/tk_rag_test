In 2003, Tizer decided to sell other-flavoured versions of Tizer, such as Purple and Green versions. There was also a brief fruitz variation of Tizer in 2004. From 1996 to 2007, Tizer was stylised as T!zer. In 2007 they stopped using Ed the Head mascot. 'Tizer Ice' was launched in the late 1990s. The drink included menthol, giving it the sensation of tasting cold, even at room temperature. Later branded Ice by Tizer, the product did not sell well and was removed from sale.
