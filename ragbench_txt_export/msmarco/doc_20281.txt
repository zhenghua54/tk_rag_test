American alligators are the largest members of the class Reptilia that inhabit North America. The term Reptilia is Latin for the phrase “to creep.” Alligators share the order Crocodylia with crocodiles, caimans, and gavials⎯all which are large, voracious animals that live in or near water. Alligators and caimans make up the family Alligatoridae, but alligators have their own genus, Alligator. There are two living species of Alligators, the American alligator and the Chinese alligator. The species that lives in United States is known as the Alligator mississippiensis
