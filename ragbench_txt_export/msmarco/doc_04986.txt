1. Body Temperature. Canine normal body temperature range is 100.5 - 102.5 Fahrenheit (38 - 39.2 Celsius). A body temperature below 100 or above 103F warrants a call to your veterinarian. Body temperature in dogs is most often measured rectally, ear thermometers can also be used, but it can be difficult to get an accurate reading.
