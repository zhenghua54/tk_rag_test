The beef brisket should be roasted for roughly 1 hour per l lb (450 g) of meat. In this case, the brisket should cook for 3 to 4 hours. 1  Do not unwrap the brisket during the cooking process unless you are checking for doneness. 1 Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. 2  The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart.
