According to Szabo (szab√≥), 1993 hereford And angus cows were culled at the age of around 8. Years (selymes) 1996 determined the minimal life span of beef cow lines as 8 years, but in his, opinion 10 years would be. optimal In the group of cows born in 1992 even the cow culled at the latest age was less than 10 years old. The explanation for the latter results, i.e. that age at culling and longevity show a decreasing tendency may be that the size of the Hungarian beef cow population has also decreased during the period studied (Table 7).
