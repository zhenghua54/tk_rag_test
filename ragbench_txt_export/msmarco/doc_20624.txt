Baked Chicken Pieces. If you want chicken to cook faster, cut it into pieces and arrange them in a shallow baking dish. Place the chicken into an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake legs, thighs and wings for 35 to 45 minutes and bone-in breasts 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces. Bake boneless breasts for 20 to 30 minutes, cutlets or tenderloins for 15 to 20 minutes and boneless thighs 25 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Victor Holguin/Demand Media.
