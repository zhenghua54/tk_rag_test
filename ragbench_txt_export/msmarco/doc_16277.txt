Your body needs 13 vitamins, including A, D, E, K, C and the B vitamins (biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B-6 and vitamin B-12). Each vitamin has a different role in making your body work properly. Eating a well-balanced diet should supply you with all the vitamins you need.
