Drop Rod Lengths. A ceiling fan should rest about 7 1/2 to 9 feet from the ground to remain high enough to be out of the way yet low enough to actually make a difference in the room. For example, use a 12-inch drop rod if your ceilings are 9 feet high, or a 24-inch rod if your ceilings are 11 feet high.
