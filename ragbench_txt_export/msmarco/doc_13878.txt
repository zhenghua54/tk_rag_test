by Walter Last. The human body has a bio-energy-circulation system similar to the blood-circulation system. The bio-energy flows along 12 main meridians, or channels. These are symmetrical on each side of the body, each pair being related to a specific organ. In addition, there are two single meridians following the midline of the body, one at the front and the other along the spine.
