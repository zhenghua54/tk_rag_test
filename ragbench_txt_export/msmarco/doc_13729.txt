The convection toaster oven uses a fan to spread the heat evenly around the oven... so no more cool spots and hot spots ! Regular ovens have uneven spots because they depend solely on the heating elements. This radiant heat is uneven, plus the distance of the food from the elements makes a difference to the temperature. The convection toaster oven is ready to go in a jiffy because it heats up quickly. It is faster cooking as well, because it uses a fan to force the hot air around the oven. This airflow blows away a thin layer of air that normally sits around the food, insulating it from the oven heat.
