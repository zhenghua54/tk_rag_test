Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a disease occurring when antibodies produced by the bodyâ€™s own immune system attack NMDA receptors in the brain. What is known is that most tumours associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis contain neural tissue (tissue containing cells identical to that found in the brain), and NMDA receptors.
