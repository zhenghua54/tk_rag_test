Yes cats can and will mate with siblings-they don't make choices about their reproduction like humans do, there's only hormones and instinct. Any kittens produced from a brother/sister pairing will be at greatly elevated risk for genetic deformities and diseases. Get the cats fixed and avoid the problem altogether.
