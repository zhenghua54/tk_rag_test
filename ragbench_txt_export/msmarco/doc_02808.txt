Taxpayers typically fill out Form 1040 when they want to deduct various items from their taxes. In this case, when you want to deduct energy-efficient appliances from your taxes, on line 52 of the 1040, you can claim or enter the amount of deduction taken from Form 5695. Fill out Form 5695, which is called the Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit. In order to claim an appliance for a deduction in 2011, for example, the product must have been “placed in service” and used in 2011.
