If you're looking to buy a media-streaming player, it's likely you'll end up choosing between four kinds of products: Chromecast, Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV. And if you happen to be a hard-core Google fan, you might be considering the Google Nexus Player and Android TV. For bargain hunters the cheaper Roku Streaming Stick is nearly as good, and the Google Chromecast is so cheap it's almost an impulse purchase. Meanwhile Apple TV and Fire TV have plenty of good points, particularly if you've already bought a lot of music, movies or TV shows from Apple or Amazon.
