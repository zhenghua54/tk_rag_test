To-die-for tarragon sauce is the ultimate mate for seafood. This sauce is ssssooooo good! If you like tarragon — that distinctive, kind of minty, kind of licorice-y leaf from the gods — it’s way beyond good. Dump the hot water out of the blender and add the tarragon and parsley. Pour in the sauce ingredients and process until the sauce is smooth and bright green. Adjust the sauce to taste by adding more lemon juice or salt.
