Phospholipids make up the basic structure of a cell membrane. A single phospholipid molecule has two different ends: a head and a tail. The head end contains a phosphate group and is hydrophilic. This means that it likes or is attracted to water molecules. This ensures that the cells will be able to get rid of wastes and take up important nutrients and gases. The plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic. This means that it is flexible and made up of many different types of molecules. Phospholipids form the basic structure of a cell membrane, called the lipid bilayer.
