Bacteria display a large diversity of cell morphologies and arrangements. A bacillus (plural bacilli) is a rod-shaped bacterium. Bacilli are found in many different taxonomic groups of bacteria. However, the name Bacillus, capitalized and italicized, refers to a specific genus of bacteria. The name Bacilli, capitalized but not italicized, can also refer to a less specific taxonomic group of bacteria that includes two orders, one of which contains the genus Bacillus.
