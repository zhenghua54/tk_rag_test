A designated learning institution number is the external term used for Organization ID in GCMS. This number is assigned to a post-secondary institution once CIC receives confirmation of their designation status from their provincial or territorial ministry of education. An applicant provides the correct designated learning institution number for their institution on the application form (IMM 1294 or IMM 5709) and this number exists in GCMS. 1  Applications that include the 2-D barcode page, received online or uploaded via a visa application centre (VAC):
