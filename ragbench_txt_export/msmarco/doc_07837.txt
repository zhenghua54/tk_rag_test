Image of a gladiator carved on concrete wall. The first ‘gladiatorial games’ were ‘offered’ in Rome in 264 B.C by sons of Junius Brutus Pera in their father’s honour after he had died. A gladiator was either a professional fighter or a slave, trained to entertain the public by engaging in combat with another person. Gladiatorial combat soon became a very popular form of public sport. People began to offer these ‘games’ and the number of matches.
