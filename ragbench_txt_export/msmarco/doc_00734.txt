This exemplifies an inefficient process, as it wastes time. The value stream map may identify a possible bottleneck where one particular machine cannot match the pace of the previous activities in the value chain. The process owners can then work to resolve the bottleneck by redesigning the work flow, adding new machinery, or through some other way.
