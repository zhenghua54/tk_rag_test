Satin Pothos. Botanical Name: Scindapsus pictus 'Argyraeus'. Satin Pothos is just as easy to grow as its relative, golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum). Keep it warm and take care not to overwater this house plant. Cold drafts and soggy soil are two things it won't tolerate. You'll see the best leaf color and variegation by keeping this pothos plant in bright, indirect light. You'll also keep this plant healthy by boosting the humidity around it. In fact, its variegated foliage makes this plant a beautiful addition to a terrarium.
