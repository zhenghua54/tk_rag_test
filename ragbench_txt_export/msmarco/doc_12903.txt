Mechanism of creep behavior of bone under a small physiological load level has not been fully understood. It was indicated that trabecular bone damage may start at the load level corresponding to as small as 2000 με (Morgan et al., 2001; Morgan et al., 2005). (2006) measured creep and residual strains of human L3 vertebral cancellous bone developed under prolonged static loading corresponding to 750 με (169 με for creep and 515±255 με for residual strain) and 1500 με (1198 με for creep and 1565±590 με for residual strain) static strains for a 125,000 sec load-unload period.
