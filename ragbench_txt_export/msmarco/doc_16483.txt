Saudi Arabia, and the Arabian peninsula, are considered part of Asia, to which the peninsula is directly connected. Being the southwest section, it is the closest part of the Asian continent to Africa. Saudi Arabia is a country in the middle east located on the Arabian peninsula. So Saudi Arabia is the country and Arabia is just the peninsula. Sort of like how America is loc â€¦ ated on the continent of North America (and no, Arabia is NOT a continent).
