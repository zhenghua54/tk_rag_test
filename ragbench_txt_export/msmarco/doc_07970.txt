When arthritis develops in people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, it usually affects multiple joints in the arms and legs. About 20% of people with enteropathic arthritis have sacroiliitis, an inflammation of the sacroiliac joints in the lowest region of the back. Physicians treat enteropathic arthritis with medications similar to those used in rheumatoid arthritis, including NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and anti-TNF medications (see “Medications for rheumatoid arthritis”).
