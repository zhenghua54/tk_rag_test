These time spans compared favourably to the average lifespan of 7.1 years for pet cats reported in a 1984 study, and to the finding that only 42% of the pet cat population in the U.S. is more than 5 years old. Feral cats in managed colonies can live long lives. A number of cats in managed colonies in the U.K. died of old age. In the U.S., the last cat in a managed colony in Washington, D.C. died at age 17, and Zorro, the last cat of a colony at the Merrimack River in Newburyport, Massachusetts, died in 2009 at age 16.
