Another way to define a recessive trait is one that is never expressed by the heterozygous genotype. For example, the heterozygous genotype for earlobe type (Ee) produces detached earlobes because the dominant allele (E) hides the effects of the recessive allele (e). Remember, individuals must have two alleles for a gene, so someone could be homozygous dominant (EE), homozygous recessive (ee), or heterozygous (Ee). In this example, the recessive trait is having attached earlobes and is only seen in someone with the genotype ee (homozygous recessive).
