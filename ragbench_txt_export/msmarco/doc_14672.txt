The lumen of the trachea is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Note that all the surface cells have cilia at their free (apical) surface. (What function do these cilia serve in the trachea?) Mucus-secreting unicellular gland cells (goblet cells) are interspersed among the ciliated cells.
