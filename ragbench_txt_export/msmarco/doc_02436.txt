How long it will take as a part-time student will be dependent on how many credits you register for per semester. Part-time is classified as less than 12 credit hours per semester. This means anywhere from 1 to 11 credits. It would take four years at a four year college or university to earn a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing). Many colleges have RN to BSN transition programs. Those nurses earn an associate degree, work in the filed for a few years, then come back to finish the bachelor's.
