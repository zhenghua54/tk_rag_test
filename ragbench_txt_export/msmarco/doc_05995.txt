Answers. Best Answer: I heard it takes a couple of weeks. Since it is in your eye it might take longer! Also, you could get an infection in your eye! Go see a doctor, she will probably give you some medicine or maybe an eye patch if you get an infection. Your capillaries are really small thin walled vessels that break easily. When that happens your body has to reabsorb the blood through your tissues and it eventually goes away. If it hurts try a cold pack.
