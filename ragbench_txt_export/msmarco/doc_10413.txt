Virtual slides used in this laboratory exercise: The nervous system consists of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (all nervous tissue outside the central nervous system). Ganglia. Most of the neuron cell bodies that lie outside the central nervous system occur as aggregates known as ganglia. Ganglia are encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue and contain a mixture of elements, some connective tissue and some of neural origin. Most prominent is the ganglion cell.
