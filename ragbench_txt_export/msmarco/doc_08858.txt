Cocci bacteria can be oval, elongated, or flattened on one side. Sometimes they may remain attached after cell division and often used to help identify certain cocci. The pair of Cocci is called as diplococcic (Neisseria) while the chain of Cocci is known as streptococci (Streptococcus). On the basis of the bacterium's shape and cell arrangement, bacteria can be classified into three categories; cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. • Cocci are round cells and can exist singly or in pairs. The single cell of cocci is known as coccus. • Bacilli are rod-shaped bacteria and single cell is known as bacillus. The length of a cell depends upon age or environmental conditions
