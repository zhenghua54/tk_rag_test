Alternate methods of direct arthrography examinations may also usemagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) following contrast material injectioninto the joint.An x-ray (radiograph) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medicalconditions. The images can then beexamined on a computer monitor, printed or copied to CD. MRI does not use ionizing radiation (x-rays).CT direct arthrography uses the same type of contrast material as conventional direct arthrography andmay be supplemented by air to produce a double contrast CT arthrogram.
