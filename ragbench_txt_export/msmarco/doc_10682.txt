Dr. Jeff Young, star of the new Animal Planet series 'Dr. Jeff: Rocky Mountain Vet,' holds up a puppy in his clinic. (Photo: David Johnson/Animal Planet). He's a striking 6'3, mustached, with long, flowing hair and a tattoo that reads Surgical Samurai in Japanese. In the 25 years since graduating from veterinary school at Colorado State University, Young has performed more than 165,000 spay and neuter procedures, and remains a staunch advocate for pet population control â€” thus the name of his practice, Planned Pethood Plus.
