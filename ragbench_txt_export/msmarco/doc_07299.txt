Some cars have four wheel disc brakes, others have only two wheel discs. Brake pads are not used in cars with drum brakes. It depends on the driver how long brake pads will last. A gentle driver can expect at least 25,000 miles on a set of front brakes. A vigorous driver may only get 15,000 miles. There are many types of brake pads; OEM, sport, heavy duty, and racing. The harder you drive, the faster the brake pads will wear out.
