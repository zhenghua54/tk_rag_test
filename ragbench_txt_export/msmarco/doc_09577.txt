GraphPad Prism was originally designed for experimental biologists in medical schools and drug companies, especially those in pharmacology and physiology. Prism is now used much more broadly by all kinds of biologists, as well as social and physical scientists. I was able to use the demo yesterday to create two layouts of publication-quality scientific graphics in an amazingly short time. I hope we're able to buy GraphPad Prism because this software is a pleasure to use, very intuitive and perfectly suited to my boss's needs and my abilities.
