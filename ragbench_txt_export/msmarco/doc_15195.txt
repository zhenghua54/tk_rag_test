Therefore, if the increase in MCV is not related to macrocytic anemia, the mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) also increases in proportion. Causes of macrocytosis are many and range from benign to malignant; thus, a complete workup to determine etiology is essential. Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a cause of macrocytosis. Because DNA synthesis requires cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) as a cofactor, a deficiency of the vitamin leads to decreased DNA synthesis in the erythrocyte, thus resulting in
