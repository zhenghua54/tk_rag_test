Davisâ€™ admission rate ticked up to 40.6 percent this year from 39.4 percent in 2013 as the university accepted 2,500 more students than last year. Out-of-state and international admissions were up 33 percent. Huge increases in the number of applicants, changing admissions processes and a growing emphasis on out-of-state and international students are driving them down. Preliminary UC admission data released Friday morning showed a record 86,865 freshmen accepted this year, an increase of 4.8 percent from 2013.
