A 3000 Watt Convector heater would use 3 units of Electricity for every hour it is running, and so would cost 3x 13p = £0.39p per hour to run. Remember that 1000 watts can also be expressed as 1kw and 2000 watts = 2kw and 3000 watts = 3kw. So to run a 2kw convector for 5 hours would cost you £1.30 based on an Electricity unit cost of 13 pence. Lets do the formula again, but this time using the rating of a 2500 watt convector heater, and an Electricity unit cost of 17p in the example. 2.5 (kw) x 5 (hours) x 17 (pence) = 212.5 Pence or £2.125.
