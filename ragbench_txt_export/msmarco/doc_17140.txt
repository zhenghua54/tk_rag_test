Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration both deal with the creation of energy, or ATP, within the body. Both begin through a process called Glycolosis in which a glucose molecule is â€¦ split into two pyruvate molecules. The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration occurs after glycolosis. Aerobic respiration occurs if there is oxygen present. Aerobic respiration creates the most ATP since oxidative phosphorylation is able to occur. Anaerobic respiration occurs if there is no oxygen present and creates less ATP. So in a nutshell, the main difference is whether or not oxygen is present. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Aerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration that uses the oxygen in order to break down the molecules, which then release electrons and creating energy. Anaerobic respiration does not need the oxygen.
