The service’s lowest-cost option, UberX, runs in everyday cars like the Toyota Prius. Uber Black is the company’s original service, costing a bit more but running in high-end town cars with professional drivers. Uber SUV is precisely what it sounds like, charging a premium for a larger vehicle. But in smaller Uber bergs like Blacksburg, Virg., the app is likely a dead zone in the middle of the night. Still, if you fire up the app and can see a car on the map, there’s one nearby. Hail the ride and you’ll get a fairly accurate estimated time of arrival. This Uber feature is a major draw, and compared to calling a taxi dispatcher and being given a rough estimate for arrival, there’s no surprise why the service is doing so well
