Costa Rica is relatively small - 19,700 square miles (51,100 sq. km), ranking it 129th in worldwide landmass. Costa Rica's size is commonly compared to the state of West Virgina (24,231 sq. mi., 62,758 sq. km) and the European state of Denmark (16,629 sq. mi., 43,069 sq. km). Don't let Costa Rica's small size fool you; it is a vast country of rolling mountains, open plains and lush river valleys. These natural features prevent the construction of super highways that would, in theory, connect relatively close locations.
