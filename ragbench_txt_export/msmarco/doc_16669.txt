The pregnancy risk for women in their late 30’s is much higher than for younger women, evidenced by an increase in the miscarriage rate and a higher rate of genetic abnormalities. At 35+ the miscarriage rate is roughly 25% and the risk of Downs syndrome becomes about 1/350. There is a very sharp decline in a woman’s ability to fall pregnant once over the age of 40. The fertility rate per month is only about 5% per month and even with IVF the pregnancy rate is only about 10% per try.
