Mizoram was formerly known as the hill region of Assam, having rolling hills, and valleys between them. After complaints by Marxist / feminist geographers, it is now known as a land of diverse elevations and tolerance to all levels of altitude-challengedness.. Several of the rivers are basically gigantic storm sewers built by the Ass People. One takes a U-turn (known as a come-uppance, by anyone with a full bladder) and goes right back to Assam. Pala Lake (74 acres) is the largest in Mizoram.
