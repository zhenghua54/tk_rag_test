Baking and broiling are completely different ways to cook food. 1  In baking, you are trying to heat food by surrounding the food with hot air. 2  In broiling, you are trying to heat food using infrared radiation. Broiling generally creates a huge mess inside the oven from all the splattering, as well as tons of smoke outside the oven (and therefore in the kitchen), which is why most people use the grill instead of the oven's broiler.
