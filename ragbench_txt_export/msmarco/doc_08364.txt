Thank you for clarifying, Yes, you can get arthritis in the chest. For example, you can get arthritis of the sternomanubrial joint. The arthritis that develops in the chest commonly involves the sternum. Symptoms would be pain in the center of the chest/front of the chest. Tenderness over the breast plate. Costochondritis (a much more common condition) also causes pain in the anterior chest along with tenderness when you push on the area to the sides of the breast bone.
