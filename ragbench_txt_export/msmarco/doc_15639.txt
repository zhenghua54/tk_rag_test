Answer: Some people lose 10lbs in the first two weeks of eating lowcarb. It all depends on metabolic resistance. If your body has a low metabolic resistance you will lose more weight in 14 days than if your body has a high metabolic resistance. To lose weight fast, eat all you want, but nothing but meat, eggs, healthy oils, mayo, butter & half an avocado a day (for added potassium). Keep the calories high & the fat percentage high, at least 65% of calories. Green vegetables & some cheese will continue weight loss but at a slower pace.
