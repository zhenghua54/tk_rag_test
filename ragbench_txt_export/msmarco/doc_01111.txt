Using a POS system makes a business much more efficient, lowering the costs of doing business while improving customer service and making the environment more pleasant to work in. In the retail trade, the “point of sale” is the moment when a customer walks up to a counter with goods and prepares to purchase them. A POS system handles the transaction, whether it takes the form of an adding machine and a hand written receipt pad or a complex computer system. The most basic POS computer system is an electronic cash register. The clerk can ring up goods in the cash register and produce a receipt for the customer. At the end of the day, various cash register functions can be used to print out daily reports that are used to reconcile the cash register and to prepare a deposit.
