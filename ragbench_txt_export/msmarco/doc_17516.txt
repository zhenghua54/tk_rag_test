Dose of Trazodone for Depression. The recommended starting trazodone dosage when treating depression is 150 mg per day (divided into two or three doses per day). Your healthcare provider may choose to increase the dose if symptoms continue, or decrease the dose if trazodone side effects occur. The maximum recommended dose of trazodone is 400 mg per day, although people who have been hospitalized due to depression may take up to 600 mg per day. Even though trazodone is not approved to treat insomnia, it is frequently prescribed in an  off-label  fashion for this use
