Box smokers (also known as vault smokers, cabinet smokers, block smokers) are basically a box with a heat source in the bottom and cooking chamber on the top. Because the heat source is directly below, like in a vertical water smoker, the heat is conserved. The Brinkmann, for instance, retails for around $85USD. At the top range of the vertical water, smokers is the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (referred to online as the WSM). Available in two sizes, 18.5 inch for around $350USD and the largest of the vertical water smokers, the 22.5 inch which sells around $500USD.
