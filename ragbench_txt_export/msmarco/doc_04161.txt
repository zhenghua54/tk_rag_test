The total recovery time for gynecomastia surgery is 4-6 weeks depending on how your body is healing. In order to ensure that you do not disrupt the healing process you need to rest completely for 72 hours, and immediately after the surgery you may experience some pain, tightness and tenderness in the area. This is generally managed with pain medication and should taper off within a week.
