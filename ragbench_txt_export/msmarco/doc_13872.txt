The meridians themselves do not begin or end on the outside of the body, but originate deep within the organs and vital energetic centers (Chakras) of the body. So, by modifying the energy of a point just beneath the surface of the skin, we are modifying the energy deep within the body. The acupuncture or tsubo points are somewhat like amplifiers along a telephone line (meridians) which interact with energy inside as well as outside the body.
