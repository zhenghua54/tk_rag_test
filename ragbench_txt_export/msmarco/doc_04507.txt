The cost to society overall is considerably higher— $8.1 to $9.2 billion, or be-tween 4.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent of BC’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product, or the size of our econ-omy). That is as much as $2,100 for every man, woman and child in BC, or $8,400 for a family of four, every year. In contrast, the estimated cost of a comprehensive poverty reduction plan in BC is $3 to $4 billion per year.
