Ok...15 and 19 are not late really. Many actors have started in their 20's and a lot in their 30's and beyond. I personally know a lady who started in her 50's. You're never too old. And the older you get, the easier it is to get a role anyways because there are less people in your age group auditioning. Which successful actors started acting late? Ok, so like...Robert Pattinson-kinda late, 15, in plays. It's not actually late, but if you look at all the other actors-seems late.
