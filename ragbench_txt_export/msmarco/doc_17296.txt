Thomas, I estimate that it could cost between $10,000 and $15,000 to replace a 2,500 square foot roof, which would be approximately $4-$6 a square foot. Obviously, the most accurate estimate for your roofing project may come from a roofing contractor who works in the Pittsfield area and has seen your house.
