wb1627 New Member. Down south I've recently dug my own foundations for a 4m x 4m extension. Hire of digger, removal of soil (3 times what you dig out in volume!!), concrete readymix and oversite including DPM, insulation etc cost me approximately Â£1500. I had to dig down and have 1m footings 600mm wide.
