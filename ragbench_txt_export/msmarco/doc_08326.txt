Etymology of the name Maria. The name Maria is Greek but it is a transliteration of the Hebrew name Miriam. When the Bible was translated from Greek to Latin, the translators had a problem because μαριαμ, the Greek version of the Hebrew name Miriam, looked like an accusative form. For some reason, the Biblical name Maria was turned into Mary in the English speaking world. But the name Maria is still very popular in the rest of it. And it seems that the name Maria was also quite popular in the time of Jesus.
