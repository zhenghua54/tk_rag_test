Remember that your reel is not a short film. Reels are decontextualized by nature, meaning that you cannot involve viewers in the story of your scene, no matter how much you might want to. Viewers don't have to understand what's going on in your scene; they only have to believe it. Every actor's reel should contain scenes that clearly identify the actor. There should never be any confusion as to whose reel we are watching. Close-ups are good, as are scenes with people who aren't in your same demographic category. This is where the art of editing a demo reel is really important.
