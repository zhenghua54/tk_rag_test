This solid is called triple superphosphate. Several million tons are produced annually for use as fertilizers. Residual HF typically reacts with silicate minerals co-mingled with the phophate ores to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6). Monocalcium phosphate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 (ACMP or CMP-A for anhydrous monocalcium phosphate). It is commonly found as the monohydrate (MCP or MCP-M), Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 Â·H 2 O (CAS# 10031-30-8). Both salts are colourless solids.
