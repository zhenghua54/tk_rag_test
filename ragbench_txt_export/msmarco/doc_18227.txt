She was also an early goddess among the Sumerians, known to them as the Queen of Heaven. The demon Astaroth was once considered Queen of Heaven to Sumerians. She also played a major role in the early development of other ancient cultures such as the Phoenicians, Babylonians, Canaanites, and Egyptians. In each culture she played a slightly different role, but was always a powerful mother figure.
