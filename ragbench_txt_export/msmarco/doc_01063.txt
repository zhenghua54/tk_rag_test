If you are going to cook more than one pot of crayfish you will need a pot with a strainer basket to hold your crayfish. Crayfish can be cooked on a kitchen stove, but it's easier if you have one of the outdoor gas cookers. These units can bring a big pot of water to boil in a hurry. They can be purchased at many large department or building supply stores for under $50.00.
