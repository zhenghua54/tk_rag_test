Engineers said the cost of SkyActiv technology is no more than conventional cars, too. The Mazda 3 will get a 2.0-liter SkyActiv gasoline engine this fall, perhaps as early as October. The new Mazda CX-5 will get it next, in early 2012. Look for SkyActiv-D diesel engines in late 2012 or early 2013. And that's not all.
