The average cost for a 2 bed flat in London can vary from £120 to £240. The price you pay depends on a number of factors but the main one is the size of the property. Lots of cleaning companies use the size of the property, namely the number of bedrooms, to build out a price matrix. Additional cleaning services, such as carpet cleaning (view our guide on what to pay for carpet cleaning in London), will increase the price. Always check your tenancy agreement as this often stipulates whether or not you need to clean the carpets before you move out.
