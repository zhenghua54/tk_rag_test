One gallon of propane has 91,547 BTU's. Appliance BTU ratings indicate the appliance usage at 100% capacity. In other words, a furnace with a 200,000 BTU/hr rating means the furnace will use 200,000 BTU's per hour when it is running at full blast. The furnace will use about 2.2 gallons of propane in one hour's time (200,000 รท 91,547 = 2.18). Pool Heater Gas Usage-If you add the propane consumption of a pool heater, the numbers really start to climb. Pool heaters are high capacity appliances that can consume more than 4.5 gallons of propane per hour (425,000 BTU/hr รท 91,547 = 4.64 gal/hr).
