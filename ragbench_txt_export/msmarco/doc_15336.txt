[LYMPH NODE, NORMAL HISTOLOGY]. Lymph nodes are small lymphoid organs distributed throughout the body at specific locations and connected to other nearby nodes by lymphatic vessels carrying lymph fluid. A node consists of two main regions cortex (long left arrow) and medullar (arrowhead). The blood vessels and efferent lymphatic channel pass through hilum (bottom arrow). The primary function of lymph node is to respond to non-self antigens and generate antigen-specific soluble antibodies from mature plasma cells.
