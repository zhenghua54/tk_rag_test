Before you can sue in small claims court, you must first contact the defendant (or defendants) if it's practical to do so. You must then ask for the money, property, or other relief that you intend to ask the judge to award you in court. In legal terms, you must make a demand on the other person, if possible. You must pay the small claims court a filing fee when you file your case. If you can't afford this expense, you may ask the court to waive (forgive) those fees. You can request a court waiver by completing and filing an Request to Waive Court Fees (FW-001).
