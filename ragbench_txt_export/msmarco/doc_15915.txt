However, WEP was an early attempt to secure wireless networks, and better security is now available such as DES, VPN, and WPA. See the Guide to Internet Security to learn about network security. WEP has three settings: Off (no security), 64-bit (weak security), 128-bit (a bit better security). If you run a network with only the default security, where WEP is turned off, any of your neighbors can immediately log on to your network and use your Internet connection. 1  For wireless devices to communicate, all of them must use the same WEP setting.
