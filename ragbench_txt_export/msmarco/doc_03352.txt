The Institute of Medicine has established adequate intake levels for sodium that address the typical needs of a healthy population. The recommended adequate intake of sodium for adults up to age 50 is 1,500 milligrams daily. Adequate daily intake for older Americans is 1,300 milligrams from age 50 through 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70. These recommendations take into account typical losses and the amount of sodium you are likely to consume while meeting other essential nutrient requirements.
