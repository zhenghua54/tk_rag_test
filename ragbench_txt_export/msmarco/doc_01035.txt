A pipefitter journeyman (once referred to as a steamfitter), through his formal training and field experience, has a clear understanding of the theory, installation, and the practical application of steam systems. The ability to assemble industrial piping modules, high pressure piping systems, food grade, and high purity systems is dependent upon the skills and abilities of the welder. The pipefitter apprentice undergoes a thorough and technically advanced welding program.
