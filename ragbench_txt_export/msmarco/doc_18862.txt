Best Answer: Hi, Good Question! Square units are often times used in area problems where one side of let's say, a rectangle is cm and the other side is cm. When multiplying these together, we get cm-squared. However, there are times when it's not this explicit, like when you have to find the are of a circle A = pi r^2. If you really want to understand what square units are and why they are used their is a really good website (the second one in the sources). If you read the first part What is a square foot?. I think you will really understand it, I found it really interesting. Source(s): http://www.math.com/tables/geometry/area...
