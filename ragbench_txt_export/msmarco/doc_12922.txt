The Berlin Airlift. June 1948 - September 1949. by David Harrisville. The story of the Berlin Blockade and the subsequent Airlift has its origins in the Second World War and grew out of mounting tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies over the question of Germany’s, and indeed, Europe’s future. The Berlin Airlift was a moral victory for the Western Allies. Instead of backing out or being unable to agree on a response to the Blockade, the Americans, British and French demonstrated their solidarity in defense of democracy.
