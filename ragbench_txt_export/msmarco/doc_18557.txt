There was no single location for the holocaust. Most of the killings took place in Nazi-occupied Poland and other countries in Eastern Europe, which is where the great majority of the European Jews lived in 1939-1944. The Nazis transported Jews from other countries under Nazi control to the extermination camps in Nazi-occupied Poland.
