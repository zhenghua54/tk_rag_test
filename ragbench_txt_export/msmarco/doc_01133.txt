Ester formulations are typically more active on weeds in comparison to amines. This is due to the fact that esters are more soluble when in contact with the plantâ€™s waxy cuticle. Plants are more likely to quickly absorb esters, as amines are more water soluble. As we all know, correct timing is crucial for acceptable weed control. This also comes into play when deciding what formulation to use; ester or amine. During cooler weather (March, April, and early May), ester formulations can be used safely, and typically provide better weed control than amines.
