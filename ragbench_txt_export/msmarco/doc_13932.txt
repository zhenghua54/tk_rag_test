Nitrobenzene is prepared by nitration of benzene with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid, water, and nitric acid. This mixture is sometimes called mixed acid.. The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (δ H = −117 kJ/mol). World capacity for nitrobenzene in 1985 was about 1.7×10 6 tonnes.
