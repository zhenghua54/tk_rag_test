You can contribute to a Roth IRA for your spouse provided the contributions satisfy the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit discussed in chapter 1 under How Much Can Be Contributed, you file jointly, and your modified AGI is less than $191,000. But, if you satisfy the requirements, qualified distributions (discussed in chapter 2 of Publication 590-B) are tax free. Contributions can be made to your Roth IRA after you reach age 70Â½ and you can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live.
