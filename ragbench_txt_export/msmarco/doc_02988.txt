mRNA is an abbreviation for Messenger RNA. It carries the genetic code for protein to the rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and enzymes in the ribosomes where tRNA (transfer RNA) carries amino acids which are matched to the mRNA to form protein. DNA is the originating molecule containing the master copy of the code. The difference between DNA and a chromosome has to deal with an intermediary-genes. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, which is a nucleic acid. It is made up of four bases-adenin â€¦ e, cytosine, guanine and thymine. When these four bases are arranged in a segment, it is called a gene.
