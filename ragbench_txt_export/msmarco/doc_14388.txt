Tamoxifen is prescribed to treat metastatic breast cancer, or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Tamoxifen is also used to lower the chance of breast cancer in high-risk women (for example, those with a family history of breast cancer). The drug may also be prescribed for off-label uses, such as treating certain brain cancers and McCune-Albright syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause early puberty in girls. Tamoxifen is used for breast cancer and in women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer. (http://www.everydayhealth.com/breast-cancer/understanding.aspx). Common side effects of tamoxifen include hot flashes, depressed mood, nausea, headache and thinning of the hair.
