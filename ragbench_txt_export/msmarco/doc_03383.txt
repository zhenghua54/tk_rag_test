A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection involving the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. These are the structures that urine passes through before being eliminated from the body. As a rule, the farther up in the urinary tract the infection is located, the more serious it is. 1  The upper urinary tract is composed of the kidneys and ureters. 2  The lower urinary tract consists of the bladder and the urethra.
