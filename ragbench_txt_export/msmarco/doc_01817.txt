This means that they only have to mate once for her to produce about 3 clutches of eggs, all 3-5 weeks apart. This doesn't always happen though. Eggs need to be incubated for those 65-75 days in 82-85 degree F heat. About 24 hours before they hatch, the eggs will appear to collapse. Don't breed a beardie until she is atleast 2 years old. Any time before that, and her bones might not be devoloped well enough to be able to produce & lay the eggs.
