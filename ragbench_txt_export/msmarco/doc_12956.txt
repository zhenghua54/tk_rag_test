The Gauls and the Romans. * Gradually, Gaul (which included modern France) was inhabited by the Gauls, a Celtic people who also lived in Britain. They were not only warriors and farmers, but also excellent craftsmen. * Gradually, the cultures of the Gauls and the Romans merged to create what is known as the Gallo-Roman society. The Romans brought roads, bridges and baths to Gaul, whilst the Gauls shared their craftmanship. Gaul then experienced three centuries of peace.
