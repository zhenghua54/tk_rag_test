An infinity mirror is a magical illusion mirror that gives a perception of great depth to a very thin mirror array. The perceived depth can be very many feet even though the mirror may not be actually deeper than a couple of inches. 1 Also be sure to have a little hole or something for each of the lights. 2  Place the regular mirror onto the workspace so that the shiny side is up. 3  Glue or secure the back of the frame to the mirror so that the light-holes are up. 4  Place the lights in the frame so that the light bulbs come through the holes.
