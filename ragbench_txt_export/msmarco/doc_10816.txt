Using colouring agents, texturing techniques and a range of standard and custom stencil designs, concrete resurfacers can be better described as concrete artists than simply concreters. Concrete resurfacing generally costs about $50 per square metre plus the cost of the concrete, but can cost up to $100m2 or more. Extra costs may include surface preparation, including cleaning and crack repair and other necessary work outside the scope of the resurfacing itself. Since every job is different, the only way to find out how much concrete resurfacing will cost you is to get quotes from concrete resurfacers in your area and compare them. Before you do, though, have a look at our paving design ideas photo pages.
