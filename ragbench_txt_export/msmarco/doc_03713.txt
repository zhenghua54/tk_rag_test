History. In 1936 the City of Howell built it's first wastewater treatment plant. This plant had a treatment capacity of 500,000 gallons of raw treatment processing per day. The initial cost of the plant was $65,000.00. The plant was upgraded in 1960 to treat up to 1.25 million gallons of sewage per day. This expansion provided the plant with primary settling, secondary activated sludge treatment, chlorination, sludge digestion, and sludge drying beds.
