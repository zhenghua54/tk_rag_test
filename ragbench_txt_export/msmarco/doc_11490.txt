Senior Member. It takes 6 weeks to have its full effect. You're doctor should have instructed you to come back for blood work at 6 weeks, then your dose can be adjusted if need be. Be patient, adjusting thyroid meds is a delicate process-and it can take 6 months to a year to get it right. I started on Armour about year ago-I felt better after a couple months-but it did nothing for my weight. 09-22-2013, 01:28 PM #3.
