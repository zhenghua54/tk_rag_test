This surveyâ€™s results showed that in 2013, the share of construction costs going to framing and trusses was nearly 17%, up from only 13.5% in 2011. The cost per square foot of framing and trusses was $11 in 2011 and jumped to $16 per square foot in 2013. The reason behind these increases is possibly attributed to rising lumber costs and shortage of professional framers. Framing crews were reportedly hard to come by in 2013.
