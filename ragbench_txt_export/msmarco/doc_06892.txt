At 72 inches wide by 84 inches long, the California king mattress is perfect for those who want more length in the bed. The California king is 4 inches narrower than a king size mattress, but it is 4 inches longer. This bed size still gives each sleeper 6 inches more sleeping width than a queen size bed. A twin size mattress is the smallest mattress available and is best suited for one child or one adult. The dimensions of a twin size mattress are approximately 39 inches wide by 74 inches long. Taller adults may be more comfortably sleeping on a twin XL bed size.
