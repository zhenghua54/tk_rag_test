How many BTUs do you need to heat your home? As a rule of thumb, you need between 40 to 45 BTUs to heat one square foot of your home. If your home is 2,000 square feet in size, you need a heating system that generates between 80,000 and 90,000 BTUs. You can use this rule of thumb to get a rough estimate of how much a new heating system will cost. However, it's important to have a heating professional make the final calculation. An HVAC professional uses a more complicated system, like the Manual J Load Calculation, to calculate the number of BTUs your new heating system will need. This system factors in how many windows are in your home, your home's layout, insulation, efficiency, as well as the number of floors you have to heat.
