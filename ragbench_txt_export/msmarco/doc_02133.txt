In New Zealand, a light commercial vehicle refers to a utility vehicle, van, or any other light (under 4500kg) vechicle that is not specifically â€¦ designed for private passenger usage. SUV's are considered as passenger vehicles. It is assigned by the manufacturer. You can find the GVWR on the VIN plate on the door or door frame of most power vehicles, and on the VIN plate on most trailers. If you add the GVWR from the Truck and trailer and it is more than 10,000 pounds, it's a commercial vehicle.
