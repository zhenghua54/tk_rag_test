General-The normal bird is primarily green with a deep blue mask. The Blue-faced Parrot Finch lies midway between the very active, inquisitive, friendly, Red-headed Parrot Finch and the shy, reclusive, relatively inactive Pin-tailed. It is an engaging character. Housing-Blue-faced Parrot Finches ideally should be bred as single pairs in flights or large cages. A metre cube is my minimum. Although they will breed in relatively small cages, but obesity can occur and birds lose condtition. I have tried to colony breeding with absolutely no success.
