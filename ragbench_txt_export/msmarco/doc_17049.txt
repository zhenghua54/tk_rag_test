ANSWER: Archangels and Cherubim are spirit beings who are at God's service and endowed with tremendous power and knowledge. They are collectively called angels, the host of heaven (1Kings 22:19, etc.), or principalities and powers (see Romans 8:28). The Bible refers to Cherubim (plural of Cherub) at least 30 times in the Old Testament, with the books of Ezekiel (12), followed the book of 1Kings (6), containing the most references. Archangels are directly referred to only twice, both of which are in the New Testament (1Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 9).
