The Typical Profile The reflow profile is defined by therelationship of temperature versus timeduring heating. A typical profile consists ofthree heating slopes (the time vs temperaturerelationship or rate of temperature rise)defined by Figure 3-1. Research International Page 14 Solder Reflow Technology Handbook It should be noted that the band width isdefined by the temperature and time axis. Ifthe product temperature profile is notmaintained within the control limits, a defectwill occur.
