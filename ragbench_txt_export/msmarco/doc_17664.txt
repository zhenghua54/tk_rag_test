The future of Slab City's squatter community — 140 miles east of San Diego — is threatened as the state considers selling the desert land in Imperial County. Slab City's East Jesus. The East Jesus Art Collective operates an artist residency and sculpture garden at the edge of Slab City. The state is open to selling the land again. The nonprofit group that oversees Salvation Mountain, a nearby artwork and tourist draw, is applying to buy the land the mountain sits on.
