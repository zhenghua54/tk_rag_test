Coal is an organically derived material. It is formed from the remains of decayed plant material compacted into a solid through millions of years of chemical changes under pressure and heat. As the organic maturity process continues, the buried plant material is transformed into different types of coal. Coal has been consumed as an energy source for hundreds of years. It provided the energy that boosted the industrial revolution of the 19th century and launched the electric era in the following century. It was the world's most important source of primary energy until the late 1960s when it was overtaken by oil.
