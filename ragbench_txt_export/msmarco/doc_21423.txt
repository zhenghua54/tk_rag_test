DNA is two stranded while RNA is usually one stranded. DNA uses a deoxyribose sugar while RNA uses a ribose sugar. DNA has the base thymine while RNA uses uracil in it's place. RNA is catalytic, while DNA is only an information storage molecule. In terms o â€¦ f their physical structure, DNA is a double helix, while RNA is a single strand. 4. DNA is found only inside of the nucleus because it is too big to pass through the nuclear pores. RNA passes through the nuclear envelope from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 5.
