On average, though, a decision for an initial disability claim takes three to four months, and a reconsideration (the first level of appeal) takes about as long, though a case could be decided much sooner or much later. Social Security Disability and SSI cases can be won in as little as 30 days, or take as long as two years for benefits to be awarded.
