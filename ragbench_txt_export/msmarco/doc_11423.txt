Learning when to use AF-C, AF-S and AF-A focus modes. 1  Set the focus mode to AF-C, then photograph a moving object. 2  Now set the camera's focus mode to AF-S and photograph a stationary object. 3  For the third exercise, change the focus mode to AF-A and photograph both a moving and stationary subject. This is also the default camera focus mode, unless you change the setting to AF-C or AF-S. MF is the manual focus mode. It's unclear why this focus mode is included, because nowadays there is usually an option to switch between auto and manual focus on the side of the actual lens.
