Boost Temperatures. The warmer the soil, the faster watermelon seeds germinate. For example, it takes approximately three days for a watermelon seed to germinate in 90 degree Fahrenheit conditions, and approximately 10 days when temperatures are at 70 degrees. Simply scoop the seeds out of a watermelon, rinse them under water to remove any fruit pieces or fruit juices, and let them air-dry on a paper towel. In general, watermelon seeds stay viable for approximately four years. However, the longer you wait, the lower your chances of optimal germination.
