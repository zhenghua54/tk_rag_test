All avocado trees need to be protected from heavy frosts and strong winds. They prefer to be planted in sunny locations with well drained soil. Most avocado trees can reach a height of 25'+ feet when fully grown. Selecting the proper location to plant your avocado tree is important for successful growing. If you want to mix more than one type of avocado tree together in a back yard setting, it is possible to plant more than one tree in the same hole or plant the trees together with as little as 4 feet of space between the trunks.
