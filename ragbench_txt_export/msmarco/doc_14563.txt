Directions: Place the salt in a shallow bowl. Coat each lemon quarter with salt and place in a 1-quart canning jar. You may need to gently force the last few wedges into the jar. Add the remaining salt along with the 1 cup lemon juice. If there are any air bubbles visible, cover the jar and shake it a little to eliminate them. Uncover the jar and add enough lemon juice to reach the lip of the jar. Store on your countertop for 1 day. Uncover the jar and add more lemon juice, if needed, to completely cover the lemons, then cover again. Store on your countertop for 6 more days, shaking the jar at least once a day.
