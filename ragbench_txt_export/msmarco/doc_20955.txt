If your wheels are relatively dirty and you need to use a wheel cleaner, then clean the wheels before you wash the rest of the car, otherwise wash the wheels last. WHEELS: Most wheel cleaners work best on a dry wheel. You may use a wash mitt, wash pad, sponge or brush to wash your car. (A wash mitt is designed to be worn on or held in your hand and a wash pad is a soft material covering sewn over a sponge that you hold in your hand).
