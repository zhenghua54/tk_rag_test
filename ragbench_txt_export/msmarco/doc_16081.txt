Both potassium oxide and calcium oxide are examples of soluble metal oxides which dissolve in water to produce alkaline solutions. Check your data book for solubilities. The question quite clearly asks you to give two answers. Do not give any more than two. (sulphur dioxide + water → sulphurous acid). Alkaline [alkali: A base which is soluble in water.] solutions are made when soluble metal oxides or metal hydroxides dissolve in water. eg. Na 2 O(s) + H 2 O(l) → 2NaOH(aq). (sodium oxide + water → sodium hydroxide). Here are some acids and alkalis that you may recognise.
