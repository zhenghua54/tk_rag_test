Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have both blood clots and antiphospholipid antibodies that are detectable with blood testing. Antiphospholipid syndrome is also called phospholipid antibody syndrome, cardiolipin antibody syndrome, and Hughes syndrome in honor of the doctor who first described it. It is important to note that antiphospholipid antibodies can also be found in the blood of individuals without any disease process.
