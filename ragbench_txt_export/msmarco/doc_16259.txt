For people with heart failure, experiencing shortness of breath when bending forward could be a sign that something is wrong, a new study suggests. One-third of these people had bendopnea, the researchers found. They cautioned that bendopnea is not a risk factor for heart failure, so the findings don't apply to people who do not have heart failure but experience shortness of breath when bending forward.
