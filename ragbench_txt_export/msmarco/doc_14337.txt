In polyphase systems, there are multiple voltages phase-shifted apart from each other so as to be intentionally “out of step.”. Notes: Although the rationale for polyphase electrical power may not be apparent from either the question or the given answer, your students need to be aware of its existence. Polyphase AC voltages are usually created by special alternators, with different “phase” windings spaced around the circumference of the stator. Notes: An illustration of polyphase alternator construction would be excellent to aid understanding of this concept.
