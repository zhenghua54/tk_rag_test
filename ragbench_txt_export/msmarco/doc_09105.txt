One of the best rain tires available at Canadian Tire is the Pirelli P7 All Season Plus, at $207. Other excellent rain tires include the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3, at $206, and the Continental ProContact, at $266. Enter the new Continental TrueContact, which Canadian Tire recently pitted against a Bridgestone Ecopia 422 for head-to-head testing in wet braking, ride comfort and a dry high-speed slalom course. My concern with the Bridgestone Ecopia as a test rival is that it is an apple to orange comparison.
