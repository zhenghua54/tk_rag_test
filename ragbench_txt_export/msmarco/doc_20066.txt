In general, the brightness temperature is a function of, and only in the case of blackbody radiation it is the same at all frequencies. The brightness temperature can be used to calculate the spectral index of a body, in the case of non-thermal radiation. (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between and; is the temperature of the black body; is Planck's constant; is frequency; is the speed of light; and is Boltzmann's constant.
