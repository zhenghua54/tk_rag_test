Causes of Pleural Thickening. Pleural thickening is a condition of the lungs that is most often caused by the long term exposure and inhalation of asbestos particles which then settle on the pleura, or pleural membrane (the thin area surrounding the lungs) causing the area to thicken, calcify and/or scar.
