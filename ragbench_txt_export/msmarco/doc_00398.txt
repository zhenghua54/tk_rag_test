Neurons. The neuron, the structural and functional unit of the nervous system, is the key cell-type of nervous tissue. An individual neuron consists of a perikaryon (cell body) and cell processes, typically one axon and a number of dendrites. A number of dendrites and one axon emanate from the cell body. The axon has few if any branches until its termination in a profusion of branches. The axon is specialized for conducting excitation from the input region to the output region of the neuron.
