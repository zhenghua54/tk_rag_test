I never had a regular dentist removed my 4 wisdom teeth-they told me they couldn't. And my cousin was the dentist. I had to go to a Oral surgeon and be put under, but mine were impacted. He or she may have a new certification I am not aware of, but I am uncomfortable about it, unless they are not impacted.
