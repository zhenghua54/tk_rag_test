Terrazzo is a flooring material traditionally made by exposing marble chips on the surface of concrete and then polishing until smooth. Now, however, you can buy terrazzo in tile form. It’s often used in public buildings because it’s long-lasting and can be refinished repeatedly. Terrazzo is quite slippery and can cause falls, so it may not be a good flooring choice for families with especially young or elderly members. Ask your contractor about applying non-slip additives to the surface. Terrazzo tile is long-lasting and comes in fun colors—just don't slip.
