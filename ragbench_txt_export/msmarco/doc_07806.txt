A Roth IRA has an annual limit on how much can be contributed. However, when it comes to rollovers there is actually no limit at all on how much you can transfer across, or roll over into a standard Roth IRA. The transfer is entirely tax free, and involves the transfer of assets from one retirement plan to another.
