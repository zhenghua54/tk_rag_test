Defrost your whole chicken. Depending upon the size of the bird, it can take between 1 and 3 days to defrost in the refrigerator. It is recommended that you cook soon after defrosting to avoid food borne illness. Learning to roast whole chickens will allow you to prepare meat for a large family or several meals at once. It can also save money on your grocery bills, since the butcher charges a premium to separate breasts, thighs and other cuts of chicken. Find out how to cook a whole chicken in the oven.
