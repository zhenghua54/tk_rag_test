An Opioid is a chemical substance that has a morphine like action in the body. Opioid's can be classified as natrual, semi-synthetic, and fully-synthetic. Natural opioid's include morphine, codeine, thebaine, and oripavine. Semi-sythetic opioids include hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and heroin. Fully-synthetic opioids include fentanyl, pethidine, methadone, and propoxyphene. Opioid's bind to specific opioid receptors in the central nervous system and in other tissues. Opioids work in the body by attaching to the opioid receptors. These receptors are found in the gastrointestinal tract, along the spinal cord and in the brain. The body stops perceiving pain when these receptors are blocked. Another effect of opioids is the feeling of euphoria that is often associated with them.
