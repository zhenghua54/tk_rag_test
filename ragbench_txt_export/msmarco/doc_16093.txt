The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people’s lives. An early form of landscape poetry, Shanshui poetry, developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D. Shanshui poetry (or Shanshui chi, traditional Chinese: 山水詩; simplified Chinese: 山水诗 lit. mountains and rivers poetry) refers to the movement in poetry, influenced by the shan shui (landscape) painting style.
