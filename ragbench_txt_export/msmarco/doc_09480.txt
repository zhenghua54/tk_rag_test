A personâ€™s brain chemistry (neurotransmitters) falls into two categories: excitatory (stimulating) or inhibitory (calming). For a brain to function properly there must be a balance between these two types of neurotransmitters. And when an imbalance in neurotransmitters exists, headaches or migraines can occur.
