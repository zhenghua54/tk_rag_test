Now researchers have identified a threshold for when a rider is too heavy for a horse to comfortably carry. The scientists base their findings on detailed measurements taken of eight horses that were ridden while packing anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of their body weight. The horses ranged in size from 400 to 625 kilograms (885 to 1375 pounds). When carrying 15 and 20% of their body weight, the horses showed relatively little indication of stress. It's when they were packing weights of 25% that physical signs changed markedly, and these became accentuated under 30% loads.
