Geography. Myanmar is located in Southeast Asia. It is the second largest country in the region, and borders China to the north and northeast, Laos and Thailand to the east and southeast, India and Bangladesh to the west, and the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea to the south. Around 300 BC, the region of southern Burma already had a rich civilization called the Mon, whose people lived on the banks of the Salween and Sittaung Rivers. In 100 BC, the Pyu people settled in northern Burma, building city states from the 1st century BC to the 9th century AD.
