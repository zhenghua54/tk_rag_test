If you choose to work with any of the Micarta® materials you should be ready to use some extra abrasives because one of this material's properties is wear resistance ... which you will figure out when you start to grind it. Micarta® is a material that is made from phenolic resigns, dyes, and a fill material like paper, linen, or canvas to create a very durable material that is very difficult to damage.
