Pharyngitis is inflammation of the pharynxâ€”the back of the throat. This can cause a sore throat, as well as scratchiness in the throat and difficulty swallowing. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons for doctor visits (UMM, 2011). The most common bacterial infection of the throat is strep throat, which is caused by streptococcus A. Rare causes of bacterial pharyngitis include gonorrhea, chlamydia, and corynebacterium.
