A common form of pituitary dwarfism is due to deficiencies in the production of growth hormone (GH). When less GH than normal is produced during childhood, an individual's arms, legs, and other structures continue to develop in normal proportions, but at a decreased rate. There are many forms of dwarfism. The word pituitary is in reference to the pituitary gland in the body. This gland regulates certain chemicals (hormones) in the body. Therefore, pituitary dwarfism is decreased bodily growth due to hormonal problems.
