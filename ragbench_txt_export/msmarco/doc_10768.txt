A bruised heel, also known as 'policeman's heel' is a painful contusion or bruising to the tissues under the heel. A bruised heel is usually caused by overuse such as repetitive bounding, long-distance running or by impact-e.g landing heavily on the heel. Bruised heel recovery time. If you catch heel pain early and rest sufficiently, the recovery period should be relatively quick, with symptoms subsiding within a few days. If the first onset of pain is ignored and the fat pad gets damaged beyond easy repair then this is a very difficult injury to treat.
