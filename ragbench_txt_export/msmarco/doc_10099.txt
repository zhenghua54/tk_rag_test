Uranus belongs to the gas giants. Its atmosphere consists mostly of hydrogen and helium and a bit of methane, which gives the planet a bluish-green color. The surface of Uranus is probably made up of frozen gas. Scientists could find out what kind of gases Jupiter's atmosphere is made up of. In 1989 NASA launched an unmanned spacecraft to Jupiter-Galileo. After 6 years, Galileo reached the planet and went into orbit. It sent a small probe through the clouds of Jupiter to find out more about the atmosphere.
