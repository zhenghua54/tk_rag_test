Some winter squash should be peeled (butternut and spaghetti are two examples), while others have edible skin (like delicata and sweet dumpling). Squash with inedible skin can either be peeled before cooking or after. All squash should have pulp and seeds removed before cooking. While winter squash can be steamed or even sauteed, I prefer to roast it. You can cut it in half, into cubes, into rings or into wedges and bake at 400 degrees for 40-50 minutes.
