In order for the patent prosecution process to begin a non-provisional patent application must be filed. A nonprovisional patent application is the application you file when you want the Patent Office to review the filing and proceed toward issuing a utility patent application. Provisional patent applications are not examined by the Patent Office, they are rather easy to file and the filing fee for a small entity (i.e., individual or business with 500 or fewer employees) is presently $130.
