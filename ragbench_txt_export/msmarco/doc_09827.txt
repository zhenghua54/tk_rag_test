Best Answer: The reference range for total bilirubin is 2 - 14. It is not uncommon to see high bilirubin levels in newborns, typically 1 to 3 days old. This is sometimes called physiologic jaundice of the newborn. Within the first 24 hours of life, up to 50% of full-term newborns, and an even greater percentage of pre-term babies, may have a high bilirubin level.
