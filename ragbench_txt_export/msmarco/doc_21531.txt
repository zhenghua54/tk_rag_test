Introduction. Bauhaus, etymologically means, Home Construction, was founded in 1919 in Weimar (Germany), by Walter Gropius, moved to Dessau in 1925 and disbanded in 1933 in Berlin. The spirit and the teachings of this institution can be said to be spread throughout the world. With the move from Weimar to Dessau, the Bauhaus had the opportunity to create a building that offered the best working conditions to develop their own design, which was carried out by Walter Gropius himself and opened on December 4, 1926, quickly becoming icon of early modern movement.
