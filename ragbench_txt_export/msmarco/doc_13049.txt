The Treaty of Versailles began with a peace conference which opened in Paris in January of nineteen twelve at the end of World War I. There were great expectations of peace. France, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States were present at the conference. However, the U.S. Senate and to some extent the American people in general began to reject Wilsonâ€™s ideas for peace and the treaty. Republican senators headed by Henry Cabot Lodge refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles without changes in the articles creating the League of Nations.
