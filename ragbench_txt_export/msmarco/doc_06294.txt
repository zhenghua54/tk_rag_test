Uber says its drivers can make $90,000 a year driving for UberX in New York City. Last month, Business Insider talked to Uber drivers who said they weren't making nearly that much. In response to criticism about how much drivers really make, Uber's New York City general manager Josh Mohrer said he would speak on the record to journalists who took 10 random Uber rides and collected pay stubs from their drivers.
