Walla Walla onion sets resemble miniature onions. Walla Walla onions (Allium cepa “Walla Walla”) produce sweet mild-flavored bulbs reaching 2 to 4 inches in diameter with stalks growing up to 36 inches high. They are considered a long day onion variety, which means they need 14 to 15 hours of daylight to form bulbs. Walla Walla onions are suitable for container growing, which allows the plants to be moved in and out of shelter. Onions in containers grow well in areas that are not normally used for gardening.
