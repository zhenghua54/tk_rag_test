History [edit]. In 1965 a consortium, CONSAER, was formed to build a new airport near the motorway, the railway and the port of Gioia Tauro; level ground near Lamezia Terme was chosen as the site. The airport opened in June 1976. Its IATA airport code SUF derives from the name Sant'Eufemia. Itavia began scheduled flights to Rome-Fiumicino, Milan-Linate, Catania and Palermo in December of that year. The airport was expanded and modernised in 1982.
