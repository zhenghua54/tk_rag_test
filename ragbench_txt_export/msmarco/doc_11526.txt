Sources of Indoor Air Pollution. Indoor air pollution can be caused by tobacco smoke, carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxides from unvented or faulty gas appliances, particles from wood-burning stoves, fireplaces and aerosol sprays, and biological agents, such as pet dander, dust and mold. A 1987 EPA study ranked indoor air pollution as the fourth highest cancer risk out of 13 environmental problems. Indoor radon exposure, which is the second-leading cause of lung cancer, was rated the number-one environmental health risk.
