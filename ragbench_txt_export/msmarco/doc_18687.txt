For this tutorial, I chose to make jerky from goat liver. A 500 gram piece cost me $2.02, which is pretty cheap. You can use this method for any type of organ meat like kidneys, hearts etc. The actual preparation time for these treats was about 45 minutes, not counting the boiling and drying of the meat.
