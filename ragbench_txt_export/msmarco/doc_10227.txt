When applied to the soil, a superphosphate fertilizer raises the amount of phosphorus available to plants. Regardless of type of plant, all require a healthy amount of phosphorus in order to survive. This nutrient is present in every cell of the plant, and is vital in maintaining the strength of the cell structure. All three types of superphosphate are usually made with a naturally occurring substance called rock phosphate. While this can be applied as a fertilizer in its raw form, putting it through the chemical reactions to create other types of fertilizer has been found to make it more effective.
