The personal is political was a frequently heard feminist rallying cry, especially during the late 1960s and 1970s. The exact origin of the phrase is unknown and sometimes debated. Many second-wave feminists used the phrase the personal is political or its underlying meaning in their writing, speeches, consciousness-raising, and other activities.
