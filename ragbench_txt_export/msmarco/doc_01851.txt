The zone levels are dependent upon the height of the trees. The temperate deciduous forest gets its name because the temperatures are temperate meaning they are not extreme. Temperate deciduous forests receive 30 - 60 inches of rain each year and are ranked second only to the rainforest as the rainiest biome. Although the average temperature is 50Â° F, the winter typically sees temperatures below freezing. The trees of the temperate deciduous forest are deciduous of course. Their leaves change color with the season and eventually fall to the ground during winter. The four seasons are easily recognizable and each lasts about 3 months.
