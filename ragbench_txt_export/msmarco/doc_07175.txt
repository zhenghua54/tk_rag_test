Causes of acute laryngitis include: 1  Viral infections similar to those that cause a cold. 2  Vocal strain, caused by yelling or overusing your voice. 3  Bacterial infections, such as diphtheria, although this is rare, in large part due to increasing rates of vaccination. Chronic laryngitis can cause vocal cord strain and injuries or growths on the vocal cords (polyps or nodules). These injuries can be caused by: 1  Inhaled irritants, such as chemical fumes, allergens or smoke. 2  Acid reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
