I am wondering what a rough estimate would be for replacing an evaporator coil in a central AC unit that is under warranty. We just had this repair done and it came in at over $1200, which seems very high considering the labor rate is only $100 and it took 3 hours to fix. Except for some brands that price their coils way up there - $1000 plus just for the element-I can't see $1000 labor and freon handling cost for a normal coil replacement, so sounds quite high to me.
