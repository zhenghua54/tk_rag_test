1 For about 4,000 square feet of drywall on all the walls and ceilings of a small home, it's $4,400-$8,600 or more. 2  Factors such as cathedral ceilings or irregular layouts can bump the price higher. 1 Patch kits to repair small holes in existing drywall are $2-$20; the more expensive kits contain materials to patch several holes or up to four feet of cracks. 2  Simple repairs can also be made using joint compound ($3-$15), a drywall hand saw ($5-$16) and average household tools such as a hammer, drill and utility knife.
