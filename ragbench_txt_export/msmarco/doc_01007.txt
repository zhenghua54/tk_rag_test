Southwest has brought back their 50,000 point limited-time promo for the Southwest Airlines® Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card. Card applicants* can get 50,000 points after you spend $2,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of opening your account. Update: Received my 50000 points from Southwest and redeemed them for $500 in Walmart cards. I’m hoping when I cancel the card I can get the $99 credited to my account. Next up…..my wife’s card for another $500.
