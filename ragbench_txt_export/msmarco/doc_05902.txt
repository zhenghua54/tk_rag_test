B Vitamins. Strawberries contain five of the B-complex vitamins. Thiamin, riboflavin and niacin share similar functions. Theyâ€™re all coenzymes needed to turn food into energy, ensure healthy skin, keep the nervous system working and to create red blood cells. Vitamin E and Vitamin K. Vitamin E and vitamin K are fat-soluble vitamins, which means they're stored in the body. Over-consumption of vitamin E may lead to toxicity, so you shouldn't have more than 1,000 milligrams a day.
