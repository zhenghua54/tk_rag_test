DNA has to replicate before mitosis to keep the number of chromosomes and DNA in the cell consistent. Mitosis is the process of reproducing cells by splitting one cell in half â€¦ to make two. If the DNA didn't replicate, the two daughter cells wouldn't be able to have a complete strand. DNA replicates by dividing in half, then creating a mirror image of itself. DNA replication mus occur before mitosis starts. Mitosis is another  word for cell division and so there must be two copies of DNA for  each cell at the end stage.
