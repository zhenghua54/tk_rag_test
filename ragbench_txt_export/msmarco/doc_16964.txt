Lumineers are another type of porcelain veneer and can cost anywhere from $800 to $2000 per tooth. The price is of course dependent upon several factors such as difficulty to fit, where they are in your mouth, and how large or small they need to be. They can cost anywhere from $1000 to $3000 per tooth, depending on how extensive the veneers need to be. If the technician is skilled they can make them look very realistic as technicians actually paint the material directly onto the existing tooth structure.
