Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D in these foods is primarily in the form of vitamin D 3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D 3 [ 12 ]. Some mushrooms provide vitamin D 2 in variable amounts [ 13, 14 ]. Mushrooms with enhanced levels of vitamin D 2 from being exposed to ultraviolet light under controlled conditions are also available.
