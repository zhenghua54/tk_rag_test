Every water heater is preset in America to 120F by the manufactures, but some states like Wisconsin require the water heater temp to be at least 125F. I set mine at 125F, which is the recommended setting for my REEM water heater. Very hot water temperature can cause burns with great rapidity, and as such, care in setting your hot water heater is required. Setting the hot water temperature lower also means a savings in energy bills for heating the home's water in many cases.
