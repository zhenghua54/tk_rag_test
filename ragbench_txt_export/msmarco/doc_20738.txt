1 , which serves as a diffusion barrier between the cell and its environment. 2  All living cells have plasma membranes. 3  A diffusion barrier prevents the loss of cellular materials by interfering with the physical tendency of molecules to spread out. Eukaryotic cells, while very similar in function to prokaryotic cells, are much larger and more complex. They are typically characterized by the presense of a prominent, more or less central nucleus. Viewed through a light microscope, this nucleus is by far the most striking visible feature of the cell.
