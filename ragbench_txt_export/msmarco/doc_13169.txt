Best Answer: From an aviation/military contracting viewpoint, a 'Contract Deliverable' is normally one of the Required Duties or sub-sets of tasks that were identified in the Customer's Specification, and to which the performing company/individual (contractor) originally submitted his Proposal (or promise) on. The deliverables are the specific items that must be delivered to the client, at a specified date, meeting the criteria defined in the contract. The details of the deliverables are usually very carefully spelled out in the contract. If they are not-get specific definitions before you get involved. Jim Â· 10 years ago.
