GIS specialists build and maintain GIS databases, and use GIS software to analyze the spatial and non-spatial information in them. They may work under a wide variety of job titles, including GIS Analyst, GIS Technician, and Cartographer. Employment of GIS specialists and cartographers is projected to grow 20 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is faster than average across all occupations. However, since it's a small field to start with, this growth will only create about 2,400 new jobs during that period.
