A physician assistant may perform medical services when under the supervision of a physician. Medical services which may be performed by a physician assistant include a referral to a physical therapist for treatment. In making such a referral, the physician assistant is acting as the agent of the physician. New York State law restricts the practice of physical therapy to licensed physical therapists or certified physical therapist assistants. Individuals who are not licensed or certified may not provide physical therapy services.
