In parliamentary systems of government, party leaders typically seek to become prime minister. It is thus typical in such states (e.g., in the Westminster system) for the party leader to seek election to the legislature, and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader. Xi Jinping is the party leader of the largest economy in the world. He is the party leader for the communist party in China and was elected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
