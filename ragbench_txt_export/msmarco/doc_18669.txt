In motorsports, homologation is the approval process through which a vehicle, a race track, or a standardised part is required to go for certification to race in a given league or series. Some sports cars are released to the public for the express purpose of meeting the homologation guidelines of a particular series or several series. In such cases, numbers manufactured are often just enough to meet the minimum requirement for homologation by the racing series for which the vehicle was designed.
