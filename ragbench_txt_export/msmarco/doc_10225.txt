Single superphosphate is the mildest grade, and contains between 16 and 20 percent phosphate. It is typically available in a liquid or a dry formula, both of which are used with the same efficiency by plants. It is also known as normal superphosphate fertilizer. All three types of superphosphate are usually made with a naturally occurring substance called rock phosphate. While this can be applied as a fertilizer in its raw form, putting it through the chemical reactions to create other types of fertilizer has been found to make it more effective.
