If a manga or anime is not translated by a company in another country, sometimes people in that country will translate the story to share with other people for free before a company translates it for the general public. This is good because it allows more people to watch animes, but some companies think it is stealing. In Japan, anime is the word used for all animation. Outside of Japan, the term anime refers to Japanese Animation or Animation similar in style to Japanese Animation.
