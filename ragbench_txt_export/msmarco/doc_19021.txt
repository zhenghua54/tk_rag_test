From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is an official committee of the Bank of England, modelled on the already well established Monetary Policy Committee. It was announced in 2010 as a new body responsible for monitoring the economy of the United Kingdom. Plans for the committee were set out in George Osborne 's first Mansion House speech in June 2010, along with the creation of the PRA and a Consumer Protection and Markets Authority (CPMA, later renamed the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA).
