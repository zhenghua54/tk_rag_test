If it is determined that the property contains an accessory dwelling unit that does not comply with zoning, the property is eligible under the following additional conditions: The lender confirms that the existence will not jeopardize any future property insurance claim that might need to be filed for the property. The appraisal report demonstrates that the improvements are typical for the market through an analysis of at least one comparable property with the same use. The borrower qualifies for the mortgage without considering any rental income from the accessory unit. (See B3-3.1-08, Rental Income, for further information.).
