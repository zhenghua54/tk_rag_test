The WPA data encryption protocol you choose depends on your wireless network’s needs. It’s critically important to secure your wireless networks, but security can be complex, particularly when it comes to configuring each network component appropriately. Most small business routers let you choose which data encryption protocol you want to use, but in order to make the best choice for your network, you need to understand the differences between encryption protocols. For wireless networks, the data encryption protocol is WPA, or Wi-Fi Protected Access.
