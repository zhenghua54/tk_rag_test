Checking for Doneness: It is not the time in the oven but the internal temperature of the roast that will determine if it is cooked properly. According to the USDA and Minnesota Pork Board, “Pork is best when cooked to medium doneness – 160 degrees F. on a meat thermometer. Trichinosis is killed by freezing for a couple weeks, or by raising its temperature to 137 degrees F. So, when cooking a pork roast, it’s best to only go to an internal temp of 140 at most, then let it rest after you take it out for 10 minutes or so. You might end up with some pink, but that’s ok.
