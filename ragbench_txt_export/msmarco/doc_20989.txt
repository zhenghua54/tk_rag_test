This form of lung disease can rapidly destroy lung tissue, resulting in severe and progressing pulmonary problems that may ultimately be fatal. Necrotic pneumonia can be due to severe lung infections or as a result of inhaling the contents of the stomach, also known as aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis. You can typically diagnose necrotic pneumonia from an X-ray of the chest. A chest X-ray will show pockets or cavities of destroyed tissue, as well as a buildup of fluid in these areas of dead lung tissue. The lungs may also be surrounded by pus or pleural fluid due to the inflammation and tissue damage.
