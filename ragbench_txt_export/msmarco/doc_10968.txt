Sourdough is one of the oldest types of bread. The 100% rye bread common in Northern Europe is one example of sourdough bread, and baguettes and other Southern European breads were traditionally made with sourdough before the advent of faster-growing yeast cultures. All one needs to make a sourdough culture is flour and water. The bacteria in a sourdough bread culture is Lactobacillus, or lactic acid bacteria, which is also used in such foods as sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, cheese, and yogurt.
