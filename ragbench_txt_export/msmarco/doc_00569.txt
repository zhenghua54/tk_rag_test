What is sprinkled over decomposing bodies? I remember seeing on a tv show that there are two types of lye, one commonly used in gardening and the other to cover dead bodies by killers. My friends say that it is lime and it helps decompose bodies. So will someone who knows what they're talking about explain this... Quicklime (CaO) or Lye (NaOH) will both speed composition of dead bodies. Quicklime was historically used in old mass pauper's graves, but they will both work.
