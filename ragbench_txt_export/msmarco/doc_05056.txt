Arm span or reach (sometimes referred to as wingspan) is the physical measurement of the length from one end of an individual's arms (measured at the fingertips) to the other when raised parallel to the ground at shoulder height at a one-hundred eighty degree angle. The average reach correlates to the person's height. An above-average reach is advantageous in sports such as basketball, boxing, discus throw, fencing, and swimming. For instance, boxer Sonny Liston had an 84-inch (213 cm) reach despite being only 72 1‚ÅÑ2 inches (184 cm) in height.
