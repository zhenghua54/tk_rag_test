Cultivated and harvested, the papyrus plants had a multitude of uses. Their roots were a source of food, medicine, and perfume. Their stems were used to make baskets, floor mats, ropes, clothing, footwear, boats, assorted building materials, and the most important writing material in the ancient world. The use of papyrus in making writing materials dates back to Predynastic times.
