Necrotic pneumonia is typically due to a bacterial infection that begins to destroy the lung tissue. The most common type of bacteria that causes necrotic pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae, though other species are increasingly being identified in sputum cultures of individuals with this serious form of pneumonia. Diagnosis. You can typically diagnose necrotic pneumonia from an X-ray of the chest. A chest X-ray will show pockets or cavities of destroyed tissue, as well as a buildup of fluid in these areas of dead lung tissue. The lungs may also be surrounded by pus or pleural fluid due to the inflammation and tissue damage.
