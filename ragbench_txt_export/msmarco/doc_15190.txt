After hours procedure codes are not covered when the service is provided in a hospital emergency department, an inpatient hospital setting, outpatient hospital setting, or an urgent care facility (place of service codes 20, 21, 22, and 23). The reimbursement for each of these CPT codes will be $12.00. SCDHHS defines CPT code 99050 to mean all patients scheduled outside published business hours; this would not include a visit that was scheduled at 4:00 p.m. and the patient was not seen by the physician until 6:30 p.m. For CPT code 99051, SCDHHS defines evening hours to be any time after 6:00 p.m. and before 8:00 a.m.
