Age. Another important factor in the price of the canopy is the age of the canopy that you are looking to purchase. If you are considering on buying a brand new one from a dealership, you can probably expect to pay anywhere in the neighborhood of $600 to $1400 with the average probably falling at around $1000. It all depends upon what kind of features that you want.
