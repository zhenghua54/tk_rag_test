It is important to bear in mind that although you may not need nursing care now, this could change in the future. On average you can expect to pay around £28,500 a year in residential care costs, rising to over £37,500 a year if nursing care is necessary*. Residential care costs are not the same in all parts of the UK, there are significant regional variations.
