The difference between the blood vessels, arteries, veins and capillaries is in their shapes, sizes and function in the circulatory system. Blood vessels as defined by the dictionary as tubular structures carrying blood to tissues and organs of the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles while the smallest veins are called the venules. The capillaries are connected to the arterioles and venules. It is important for the capillaries to be thin and small to be able to transfer of nutrients and other matters.
