Gastroparesis is a stomach disorder in which the stomach doesn't empty properly, even when there is no blockage to the exit of the stomach. Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes. It happens when the nerves that regulate how the gut moves food forward in the digestive process are damaged from being exposed to high blood sugar for many years. Consequently, the stomach does not empty out the way it normally would.
