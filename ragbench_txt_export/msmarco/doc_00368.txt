Tufted Titmice. I know geese is the plural of goose. But does that hold true for a term like Canada Goose which isn't a generic term-it is a proper name. So it seems like geese isn't correct. I'd agree with Keith as Titmice just doesn't ring right somehow and puts the emphasis more on Mice than the intended flock of Birds. Though with Canada Geese it's a different thing, to my mind, Geese is what I always use and what sounds right, Canada Goose for plural just doesn't sound right.
