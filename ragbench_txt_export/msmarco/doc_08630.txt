The Federal Government pays the interest for Direct Subsidized Loans while the student is in college or while the loan is in deferment. Interest begins accruing for Direct Unsubsidized Loans as soon as the loan is taken out. For subsidized loans, the maximum is $3,500 for freshmen, $4,500 for sophomores, and $5,500 for juniors and seniors. Undergraduates who are not eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans may borrow an identical amount in a Direct Unsubsidized Loan
