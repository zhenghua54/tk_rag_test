Joan of Arc was then classified as a relapsed heretic and ordered, on May 29, to be put to death. At the Place du Vieux-Marche in Rouen, her last request was to have a priest shout prayers and hold a crucifix for her to see as she died. On May 30, 1431, Joan of Arc was burned alive at the stake. Joan of Arc was sentenced to death for her beliefs and thirty years later, she was found to be not guilty. Joan was canonized (made a saint) by Pope Benedict XV in 1920 at St. Peterâ€™s Basilica. Her legend now lives on as Saint Joan of Arc.
