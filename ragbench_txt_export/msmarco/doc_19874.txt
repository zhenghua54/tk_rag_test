Rome's weather varies from very hot in the summer to distinctly cool in the winter, and rather damp in the autumn. However, the weather is rarely severe or disruptive, and so your preferred season for visiting Rome will largely depend on what you want to get from your holiday. The weather in Rome during the autumn months can be quite wet, with around 4 inches of rain each month, and rain every few days on average. However, temperatures are still pleasantly mild and the historic sites are less crowded, so this is definitely an appealing time of year for your Roman visit.
