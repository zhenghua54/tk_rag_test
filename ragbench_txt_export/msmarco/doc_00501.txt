During the incubation period, the patient is typically not contagious. The classic trio of symptoms indicative of meningitis are headache, stiff neck, and a high fever. The incubation period for meningitis can vary between 2 to 14 days. Children under the age of five face a high risk of contracting meningitis-related infections. The spinal cord is normally enclosed within membranes called meninges, which protect and cushion long nerves.
