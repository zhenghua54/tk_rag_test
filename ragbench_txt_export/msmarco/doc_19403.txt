Recycling has always been encouraged as a way to help the environment, but it also has its downfalls. One problem that many people focus on with recycling are the emissions from the increasing amount of trucks used to pick up recycling. However, this is not an established problem. Another issue of recycling is the amount of energy used. Wood products, petroleum and aluminum all require a lot of energy to refine and reuse, which is why consumption should be reduced. However, when aluminum is bought it is better to recycle it than throw it away.
