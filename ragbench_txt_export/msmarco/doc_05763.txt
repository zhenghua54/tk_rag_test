The major difference between the requirements for a controller and an accountant is that the controller is a manager, and their focus in school will be in both finance and business administration. If you start in the field of accounting as an accountant, your experience may replace the need for an MBA. Controllers are in charge of money and accountants, and accountants are responsible for keeping tabs on where the money is going. As the Chief Accounting Officer of an organization, the controller, often called a comptroller, is also responsible for complying with tax laws and government reporting requirements.
