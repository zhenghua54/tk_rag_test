In the proximal convoluted tubule, a considerable amount of resorbtion occurs. Small proteins, glucose, and ions are returned to the blood by active transport. Negatively charged ions follow passively, followed by the osmosis of water. About 75% of the filtrate is returned in this section of the nephron. The distal convoluted tubule, urine is then passed through here to the collecting duct where it is concentrated due to its permeability to water. It leaves the collecting duct into the pelvis of the kidney, which leads to the ureter and the bladder where it is stored.
