Costs of owning a dog. Dogs can live for up to 15 years, so on top of the initial costs for the first year, you may be looking at an additional $910 per year minimum for the duration of the dog's life. The final figure may be more or less, depending on the dog, breed, age, size and any illness or accidents, etc.
