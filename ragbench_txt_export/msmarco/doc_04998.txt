This is the follicular phase of menstruation NOT the ovulation phase. Ovulation occurs when the follicle bursts and releases the egg into the fallopian tubes. This is caused by a spike of luteinizing hormone at about 14 days into the cycle. While FSH spikes at the same time, it is not the actual hormone responsible for the process of ovulation.
