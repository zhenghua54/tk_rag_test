Some repair places charge more than $200 to fix iPad glass screens and you can usually find replacement iPad glass screens—with the digitizer necessary for touch functionality—for around $30 or so on eBay. A busted screen on your iPad can cost a pretty penny to get fixed, but you can do it at home if you're up to the challenge.
