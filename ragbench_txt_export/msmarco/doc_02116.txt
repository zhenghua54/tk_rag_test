Usually, 0.6 mg colchicine is taken once or twice daily to prevent gout flares (maximum, 1.2 mg/day), and a dose of 1.2 mg is taken at the first sign of an acute gout flare, followed by 0.6 mg 1 hour later. Prophylaxis of gout flares: If the original colchicine dose were 0.6 mg twice daily, 0.3 mg should be given once daily. For an original dose of 0.6 mg daily, the adjusted dose is 0.3 mg every other day.
