Best Answer: There is no minimum or maximum amount of time a jury must deliberate. It is up to the judge. A criminal defendant is not acquitted because of a hung jury. The government can make the person go through another trial. If the parties want a select number of the jurors to agree in a civil case and the current jury is unable to meet that level, the judge will declare a mistrial and the parties will try the case again with a different jury.
