We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f (x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L. The function f is continuous at p if and only if the limit of f (x) as x approaches p exists and is equal to f (p). If f: M â†’ N is a function between metric spaces M and N, then it is equivalent that f transforms every sequence in M which converges towards p into a sequence in N which converges towards f (p).
