Some of America's indigenous people call themselves  Indians, while others prefer the term Native American or some  other designation (usually tribal). Many people prefer to be called  by their tribal nation name such as Hopi or Navajo or Lakota or  Suquamish. He called them Indians because he believed he was in India.
