Despite their similar appearance, Korean and Siberian ginseng come from different families. Korean ginseng and Siberian ginseng, despite both being called ginseng, are not from the same family. Siberian ginseng does not belong to the Panax family, so it is not considered a “true” ginseng. Both types of ginseng are considered adaptogens, meaning they help your body defend itself from stressors, providing a boost to your immune system. Also known as Asian ginseng or Panax ginseng, Korean ginseng is native to East Asia and Russia. The root of the plant is what is used and, as an adaptogen, it has been used medicinally as an immune system booster.
