icloud does indeed backup your apps. Level 9 (62,675 points). Your iCloud backup does not include your apps, it includes your app data. It only notes the apps that were on your device at the time it was backed up so it can restore them to your device by redownloading them from the app store if they are still availalbe. Level 10 (92,020 points). The time it takes to back up for the first time depends on the how much is being backed up (you can find this from your back up settings) and how fast your connection is.
