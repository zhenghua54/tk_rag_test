DNA has thymine as one of the two pyrimidines while mRNA has uracil as its pyrimidines base. DNA is present in the nucleus while mRNA diffuses into the cytoplasm after synthesis. DNA is double-stranded while mRNA is single-stranded. mRNA is short-lived while DNA has a long lifespan. Both of these have structural and functional differences between them. DNA. DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is the basic genetic material of major life forms except the plant viruses, bacteriophage, and a few other viruses in which either the DNA is absent or any variation of the double-stranded DNA is present.
