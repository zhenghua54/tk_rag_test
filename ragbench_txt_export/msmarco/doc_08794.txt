Standard Deviation is normally written as Ïƒ The standard deviation for American men's height is about 3. Knowing that, we can figure out what the rest of the population looks like too. Each time height increases by 3, by a standard deviation, the population drops off considerably. There are just about exactly 100,000,000 adult men in America. Now that we know their average height is 5'10 and the standard deviation is 3, we can predict how many of these men fall into various height categories.
