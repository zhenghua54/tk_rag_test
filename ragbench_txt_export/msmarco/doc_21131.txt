However, I concluded why it exists by a description of how it is controlled. There are two inlet ports cast in the manifold for each cylinder. The IMRC is a vacuum controlled actuator that opens butterfly valves in one of the two inlet ports. A V6 engine has two IMRCs, one operating each bank of cylinders. The actuators open the butterfly valves at high rpm, allowing plenty of air to enter the cylinders. The IMRC system keeps the airflow even to all the cylinders when the engine is operating at low speed by restricting airflow through the valved port. This is done by closing the butterfly valves, limiting each cylinderâ€™s ability to get air by increasing the inlet resistance
