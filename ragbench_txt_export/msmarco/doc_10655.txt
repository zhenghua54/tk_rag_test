Pain receptors on A-delta fibers are activated in response to sharp, well-localized pain that requires an immediate reaction. This type of painful stimulus is sometimes referred to as “somatic pain,” and it usually involves damage to skin or muscle. If a drug inhibits the release of second messengers, then the pain receptors will not be activated, the pain impulse will not reach the brain, and the person will not perceive pain from the damaged tissue. The same thing happens if the brain’s response is delayed or neutralized.
