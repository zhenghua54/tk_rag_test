Metals rarely occur in nature in their pure metallic state. Only gold, silver and copper (so-called native silver and copper) have been found as metals. All of the other metals occur in nature as compounds combined in structures called minerals. Rocks are composites of different minerals formed through the cooling of liquid magma, altered by the action of wind, water, glaciers and gravity, or changed through the effects of pressure and temperature as the earth evolved
