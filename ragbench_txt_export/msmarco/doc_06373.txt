Titration is a laboratory method used to determine the unknown concentration of a reactant. This is a delicate procedure that requires patience and a good observation skills. Usually, an indicator is used in titration to determine the endpoint of the reaction. Once the endpoint volume is found, mathematics can be used to determine the concentration of the unknown. This procedure is commonly used in the field of analytical chemistry
