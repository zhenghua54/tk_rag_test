Fresh ingredients, made to order, assembled just the way you like them — it's no wonder that Chipotle's endlessly customizable burrito bowls are a crazy popular option for a weekday office lunch or quick dinner. Bring the water, lime juice and lemon juice to a boil in a small (1 ½ to 2 quart) saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt and stir to dissolve, then stir in the rice. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook without stirring or uncovering the pot for about 20 minutes, until the rice is fluffy and has absorbed the liquid.
