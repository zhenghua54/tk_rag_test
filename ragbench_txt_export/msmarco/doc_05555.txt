Obviously as discussed in our book, breakfast shows are the only shows where money can be earned, but having said that a breakfast show host on a small fringe radio station can earn as low as £18,000 or £75 per show; some even less. £18,000 for a small radio station would still be considered a high salary to pay. In these cases a starting programme fee equivalent might be in the region of £100-£200 per programme.
