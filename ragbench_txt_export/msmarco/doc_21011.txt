ASVAB Subtest Scores. Each military branch uses the ASVAB's 10 subtests, such as word knowledge and mathematics knowledge, to create a composite score for each job. In addition to its AFQT, every military job also has a minimum ASVAB composite score that an enlistee must meet to qualify for training in that job. AFQT Score Range. According to the U.S. Army, people are referring to their AFQT score when they talk about their ASVAB score. AFQT scores range from 1 to 99 and they're spread across eight categories from Category I for scores of 93 to 99 down to Category V for scores of 1 to 9.
