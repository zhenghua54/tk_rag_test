This is a simple indirect test that is used to estimate the predominant muscle fiber type-slow twitch or fast twitch. It is interesting for athletes to know the composition of their muscle fibers. If they are primarily a strength or speed athlete, they want fast twitch fibers. For endurance athletes, more slow twitch fibers is optimal. This test does not replace an actual muscle fiber composition test, which would be more accurate but involves an invasive muscle biopsy and more sophisticated analysis. 1  purpose: to estimate the predominant muscle fiber type for any given muscle group.
