The best way for free-to-players to make money with the Fishing skill is on Karamja. Since they can only fish up to Swordfish, these fish along with Lobsters and sometimes Tuna are the best healing fish in the Free-to-play world. You can try to sell them either on the Grand Exchange, or in the RuneScape forums. However, it is usually hard to sell them in the RuneScape forums, so the Grand Exchange is recommended. Another alternative is using the High Alchemy spell on the Longbows. You will get 768 coins for each alchemy spell.
