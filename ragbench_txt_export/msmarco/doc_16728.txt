Hemostasis, that is, various mechanisms that can lead to the clotting of blood, is a process that involves paracrine signaling as so too are various signals exchanged between leukocytes (i.e., white blood cells) such as during antigen presentation. Paracrine signaling can be loosely viewed as hormone-like signaling though, unlike hormones, the signalling molecules do not enter the blood and therefore have only local immediate effects rather than systemic effects.
