All workers qualify for 5.6 weeks paid annual leave (“holiday”) under the Working Time Regulations 1998 (“WTR”), regardless of how long they have been employed. This is called the statutory minimum holiday entitlement, and amounts to 28 days per year (inclusive of public holidays) for a full-time employee.
