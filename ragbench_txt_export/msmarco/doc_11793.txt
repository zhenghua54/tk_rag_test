1 Harvest regular slicing cucumbers when they about 6 to 8 inches long (slicing varieties). 2  Harvest dills at 4 to 6 inches long and pickles at 2 inches long for pickles. 3  The large burpless cucumbers can be up to 10 inches long and some types are even larger. I planted cucumber seeds about three weeks ago. About fifteen in a cup as the directions told me so but they all came up and after growing to about seven inches tall with 2 leaves overnight they all wilted. That day I got a large deep pot and transplanted all of them added a little plant food.
