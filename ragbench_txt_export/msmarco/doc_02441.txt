The bachelors degree is designed as a four year program of study as a full-time student with an average credit load of 15 credit hours per semester (for institutions that operate on a regular two semester academic year). It would take four years at a four year college or university to earn a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing). Many colleges have RN to BSN transition programs. Those nurses earn an associate degree, work in the filed for a few years, then come back to finish the bachelor's.
