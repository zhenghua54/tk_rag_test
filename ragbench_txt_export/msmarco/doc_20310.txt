As these pockets of magma cool slowly they become igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are also formed when volcanoes erupt. Igneous rocks are formed as the lava cools above ground. The upper 16 km of the Earthâ€™s crust is composed of 95% igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies underground.
