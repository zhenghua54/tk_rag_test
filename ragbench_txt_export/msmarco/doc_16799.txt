However, it exhibits a undesirable effect known as corner effect which degrades the device performance by increasing the off state leakage current. In this work a new technique to suppress the corner effect has been proposed, modelled, simulated and its results have been compared with existing structure of square gate all around MOSFET. Keywords: Square Gate All Around MOSFET, Corner Effect, charge sharing, premature inversion.
