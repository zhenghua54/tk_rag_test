The Necker cube: a wire frame cube with no depth cues. The Necker cube is an optical illusion first published as a rhomboid in 1832 by Swiss crystallographer Louis Albert Necker. A rotating Necker cube was used to demonstrate that the human visual system can recruit new visual cues that affect the way things look. A doctored photograph purporting to be of an impossible cube was published in the June 1966 issue of Scientific American, where it was called a Freemish Crate.
