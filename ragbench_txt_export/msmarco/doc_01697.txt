As the thickness of oxide varies, so will color. Oxides form naturally on titanium leaving the metal a gray color, but applied heat and or electrochemical treatment will increase the oxide thickness to produce a spectrum of color similar to a rainbow. This same filtering effect can be seen in colors on soap bubbles. TiO2 oxide is surface oxide of titanium, and if not properly cared for the colored surface will be altered by abrasion. In order to maintain this beautiful surface, please take care of the following items: 1  Wash with a soft sponge, or cloth using mild detergent.
