The property of inductance might be described as when any piece of wire is wound into a coil form it forms an inductance which is the property of opposing any change in current. Alternatively it could be said inductance is the property of a circuit by which energy is stored in the form of an electromagnetic field. We said a piece of wire wound into a coil form has the ability to produce a counter emf (opposing current flow) and therefore has a value of inductance.
