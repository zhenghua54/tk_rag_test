American writers, however, consider that Myles Standish was born in Lancashire, the earliest authority for this being Nathaniel Morton, whose New Englands Memoriall was printed in 1669, thirteen years after the death of Myles Standish. It must be noted that William Standish the Younger inherited Ellanbane in 1607 at which date he must have been at least 21, which would mean that his date of birth must have been not later than 1586, and this supports the date of 1584 (and not 1586/7) as being the year in which Myles Standish was born.
