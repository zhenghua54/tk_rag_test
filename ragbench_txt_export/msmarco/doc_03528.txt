Hiking. As one of the most popular waterfalls in Hamilton, Webster's Falls is a 22 m high classical curtain/plunge waterfall found in the Spencer Gorge/Webster's Falls Conservation Area. Noted for its panoramas, Webster's Falls offers beautiful views of the forested depths of the gorge below. Within the park, there are washroom facilities, picnic tables and sheltered areas at the top of Webster's Falls. The area is quite pretty with a cobblestone footbridge that crosses over Spencer Creek. You can take the nature trail to Dundas Peak, which provides spectacular views of Dundas and Hamilton
