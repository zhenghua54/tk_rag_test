Currently, in 35 states, such as California, Illinois, and Mississippi, the secretary of state is elected, usually for a four-year term. In others, the secretary of state is appointed by the governor; Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia are amongst the states with this practice. Hand in hand with this duty, in most states the Secretary of State is responsible for state trademark registration and for chartering businesses (usually including partnerships and corporations) that wish to operate within their state.
