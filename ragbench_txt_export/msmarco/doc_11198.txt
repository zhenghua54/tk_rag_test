Nucleotides have a double-bonded oxygen at the first carbon that can bond with a nitrogenous base. The third carbon of the base is what bonds with the nucleotide. The hydroxyl (OH) at carbon two is what makes the difference between a ribose (in RNA) and a deoxyribose (in DNA). The fifth carbon bonds with the phosphate. Nucleotides are also important for metabolism as well as the maintenance and enhancement of cellular immunity.
