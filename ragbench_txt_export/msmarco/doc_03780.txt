Actually, there are lots and lots of perennial herbs. Nothing lives forever, of course, so there are some which are best replaced after a few years. Thyme, for instance, is classified as a perennial, but it's past its best after about 3 years. Lavender is a perennial, but is usually best replaced after 5-7 years. Just google the herb your interested in and type perennial or annual and the info will show up. Then google it and type hardy, that tells you which zones the plant won't die in a normal winter (ie. doesn't get colder than the minimum for your hardiness zone).
