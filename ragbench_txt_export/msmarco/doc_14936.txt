By Mayo Clinic Staff. The precise cause of canker sores remains unclear, though researchers suspect that a combination of factors contributes to outbreaks, even in the same person. Possible triggers for canker sores include: 1  A minor injury to your mouth from dental work, overzealous brushing, sports mishaps or an accidental cheek bite. 1 Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 2  Behcet's disease, a rare disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body, including the mouth. 3  A faulty immune system that attacks healthy cells in your mouth instead of pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria.
