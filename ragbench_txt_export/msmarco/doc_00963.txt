Problems with the blood circulation system can affect wound healing because the tissues do not get the required supply of oxygen and nutrients. Wound healing is complex, and there can be many causes why it does not happen properly. In spite of all you can do, a cut-even minor-can take a long time to heal. If this is the case, there may be some more severe underlying problem that can lead to dangerous complications. Always consult your doctor for non-healing cuts.
