Sugar is first and foremost used because of its sweetening properties. It has a clean sweet taste with no aftertaste and is the reference against which other sweeteners are compared. Beyond its sweetening properties, sugar provides structure and texture to many traditional foods, such as bakery products and jam. As in addition to its sweet taste, sugar contributes to the colour, flavour and texture of food, adding sugar to foods can improve their taste and palatability, thereby increasing the range of foods that people can eat.
