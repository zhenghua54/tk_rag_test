[ˈpenːe]) is a type of pasta with cylinder-shaped pieces. Penne is the plural form of the Italian penna, deriving from Latin penna (meaning  feather  or  quill ), and is a cognate of the English word pen. In Italy, penne are produced in two main variants:  penne lisce  (smooth) and  penne rigate  (furrowed), the latter having ridges on each penna. There is also pennoni (big quills), which is a wider version of penne.
