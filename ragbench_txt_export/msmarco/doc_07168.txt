Now We May Begin was produced by The Crusaders, and this song (as well as Street Life) was written by their keyboard player Joe Sample with lyrics by Will Jennings, who told us: 'One Day I'll Fly Away' was written specifically for Randy Crawford. On that album Randy also covered a song Joe and I wrote for the B.B. King Take It Home album, Same Old Story.. In 1980 Lalo Shifrin and I wrote People Alone for the film The Competition, which Randy performed.
