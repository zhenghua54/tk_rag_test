The contagious period is over after being on antibiotics for 24 hours. Relief from the sore throat should come within 24 hours to 36 hours after you start taking antibiotics. Doctors recommend throat lozenges, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen and gargling with warm salt water to ease the pain for the first few hours.
