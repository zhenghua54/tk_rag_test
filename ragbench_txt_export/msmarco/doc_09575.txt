Although the main ingredients included in Royal Canin cat food are top notch, the company has a tendency to include corn, and corn gluten meal, as well as some other filler type ingredients which do not offer good nutrition. In fact, some cats are allergic to these types of ingredients. My cat, Sierra, has been eating Royal Canin ever since I adopted her from the Petco Adoption Center (Silicon Valley Humane Society) when she was a kitten. This was the food brand they were giving her at the time and I didn’t question it. Now, she’s three years old, going on four this year.
