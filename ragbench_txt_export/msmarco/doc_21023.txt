They are common at pet stores, easy to care for, and cheap. I got mine at a local PetSmart for $35 after a $5 discount. That just covered the gecko, and it wasn't a morph. Leopard geckos can range in the the hundreds of dollars if you want to go elaborate, but a common, normal gecko won't cost much. I spent about $170 on the tank and everything else I would need.
