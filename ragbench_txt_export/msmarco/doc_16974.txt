For long-term treatment to prevent UTIs in adults, a dose of 50 or 100 mg once daily at bedtime is usually sufficient. The recommended dose of nitrofurantoin for treating urinary tract infections in children (age one month and older) is based on body weight. As a result, it is best if your child's healthcare provider weighs your child in order to determine an accurate dosage, especially if your child has not been weighed recently. The recommended nitrofurantoin dosage for treating UTIs in adults is 50 to 100 mg four times daily, continued for at least three days after the infection has cleared.
