Kidney disease damages your kidneys, preventing them from cleaning your blood as well as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body and lead to other health problems, including heart disease, anemia and bone disease. Chronic kidney disease eventually can cause kidney failure if it is not treated. Renal function, or kidney function, is a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering blood. If you have two fully-functioning kidneys, you have all of your renal function (100 percent). A majority of kidney diseases damage renal function by attacking little filtration units in the kidneys, called nephrons.
