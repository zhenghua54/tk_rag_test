The “Powder Blue” Air Jordan 10 hit retail stores in late February; first day sales reportedly topped $35 million worldwide. Air Jordans are manufactured in China and reportedly cost Nike a bit more than $16 a pair. The Air Jordan 10s are listed on Amazon for $250 to $550 a pair, depending on the style and color. If that strikes you as a rather hellacious markup, welcome to the world of “luxury” goods, where the selling price is determined not by the cost of the goods, but by the status that buyers think they confer.
