For the first nine years of the war, the Greeks attacked the surrounding cities and outlying areas to cut off the food supply from Troy. The city of Troy itself had huge walls which were built with the help of the gods. It was not until the tenth year that the Greeks attacked the city of Troy itself. The war was not going well for the Greeks at this point. The Greeks learned from a captive Trojan prophet that four things had to happen if they were to conquer Troy. 1) Achillesâ€™ son Neoptolemus, who the Greeks had abandon on an island several years earlier, had to join the fight.
