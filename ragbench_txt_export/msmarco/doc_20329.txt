Contributing Factors. Salaries for fisherman in Alaska differ depending on whether a fisherman is a permit holder or a crew member. Generally, permit holders have their own equipment, can employ crews and earn higher incomes. They also usually earn more in offseason non-fishing related jobs than those working for them. Those catching miscellaneous shellfish earned the most, taking in $31,193 annually. Groundfish and sablefish fishermen earned among the least, with annual salaries of slightly less than $21,000.
