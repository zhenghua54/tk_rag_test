The company noted that it was recently rewarded a contract for one well in West Africa at $630,000 a day (with a start date estimated to be Q4:2009). Expect $600,000 day rates to become more common. Last month, Brazilian Petrobras awarded Norway's SeaDrill with contracts for three deepwater rigs worth up to $4.1 billion, with day rates in excess of $600,000.
