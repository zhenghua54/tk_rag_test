1 Place your turkey in the oven. 2  When the turkey is about ⅔ done, loosely cover breast and top of drumsticks with a piece of foil to prevent overcooking. 3  Your turkey is done when the temperature with a meat thermometer is 180° F in thigh and 165° F in breast or stuffing. Just follow these simple instructions for a fresh or thawed turkey: 1  Preheat oven to 325° F. Drain juices and pat dry with clean paper towels. 2  Place turkey breast side up on a flat rack in a shallow roasting pan 2 to 2½ inches deep. 3  Turn the wings back to hold the neck skin in place.
