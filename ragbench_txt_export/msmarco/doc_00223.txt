The function of the stratifed squamous epithelium: It functions to protect underlying tissues in areas subjected to abrasion. The keratinized type forms the outermost layer of the skin, where it functions to prevent water loss. The nonkeratinized variety forms the moist linings of the mouth,esophagus, anus, vagina. The alveoli is just one cell layer thick so that diffusion of gasses between the capillaries and the alveoli is easy. Simple squamous epithelium are found in the capillary wal â€¦ ls and the alveolar walls. They are thin so diffusion is easy
