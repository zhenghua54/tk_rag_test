Best Answer: As the first three answerers agree, files downloaded from download.com are *safe*... but that doesn't mean that you can't get some (safe) junk from there ;-) My preferred download site is majorgeeks.com. Check them out too. Report Abuse. No No No Avoid CNET at all costs... it is capitalizing on it's past reputation as a trusted download site to spread malware ...CNET has recieved millions to attach junk/malicious downloads onto legitimate ones.
