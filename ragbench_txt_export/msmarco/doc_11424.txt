This link explains it well. Paraphrasing the article: 1  AF-C (AF-continuous or servo mode) is used for photographing moving subjects. 2  AF-S means single shot and is used for subject that is stationary. AF-A is where the camera decides whether the subject is moving or not and tries to alternate between the servo and single shot mode accordingly. add a comment |. up vote 5 down vote. There is another important difference between AF-S and AF-C. With AF-S, you cannot take a shot without focus being locked (green light being on). With AF-C you will take a shot anytime the shutter release is pressed.
