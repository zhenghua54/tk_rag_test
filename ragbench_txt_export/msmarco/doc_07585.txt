Like humans, dogs also gradually lose their baby teeth. Puppies, like new-born babies, are born without teeth. Canines will not grow their first baby teeth till they reach about six to eight weeks of age. Dogs normally grow as many as 28 teeth, which are commonly referred to as the baby teeth or the deciduous teeth.
