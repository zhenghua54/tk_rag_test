Bolar blade meat is a cut of beef taken from a cowâ€™s shoulder, which contains strong muscles and can be tough. Therefore, satisfactory preparation of bolar blade meat requires slow cooking. Bolar blade meat can be cut into steaks, thin-sliced for roast beef sandwiches or chopped into strips for stir-fry dishes.
