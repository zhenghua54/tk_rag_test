A Q&A with Michael Carroll. Mindfulness is our natural ability to remember that we are here, present fully in our life—alert, open and engaged. As importantly, mindfulness is also a meditative practice for training our mind to live in the present moment and appreciate our immediate experience. We are always trying to get from point A to point B as quickly and efficiently as possible. Unfortunately, too often when we arrive at point B, our health and well-being is often in tatters. Through mindfulness-awareness we discover that we don’t have to sacrifice sanity and balance in our pursuit of livelihood.
