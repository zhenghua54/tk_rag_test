Trade Winds. Blowing from the subtropical highs or horse latitudes toward the low pressure of the ITCZ are the trade winds. Named from their ability to quickly propel trading ships across the ocean, the trade winds between about 30Â° latitude and the equator are steady and blow about 11 to 13 miles per hour.
