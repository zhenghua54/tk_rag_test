Legal Fees. In a divorce, both spouses will generally have lawyers. Attorney fees vary widely depending on the area, the individual attorney, the number of contested issues and the length of the trial. According to Divorce Court Attorneys, a two day divorce trial can cost as much as $25,000 in legal fees alone. Divorce lawyers generally charge from $75 an hour and up, with partners in large firms charging as much as $450 an hour.
