“In-house assets”. Your SMSF can invest up to 5% of your SMSF’s value in “in-house assets”. An in-house asset is a loan to, or an investment in a related party or trust of your SMSF or a lease arrangement with a related party or trust. For instance, an SMSF can acquire shares in the member’s brother’s business as long as the value of those shares does not exceed 5% of the fund’s total market value. A related party of your SMSF broadly includes any other member of the SMSF, an employer that contributes to the fund by agreement (“standard employer-sponsor”), your relatives, partners, and companies where the member or standard employer-sponsor controls or significantly influences the company.
