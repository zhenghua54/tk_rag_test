You have three pairs of major salivary glands under and behind your jaw â€” parotid, sublingual and submandibular. Many other tiny salivary glands are in your lips, inside your cheeks, and throughout your mouth and throat. Salivary gland cancer most commonly occurs in the parotid gland, which is just in front of the ear. Treatment for salivary gland cancer often involves surgery.
