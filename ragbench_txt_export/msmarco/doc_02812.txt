Tax Deductions for Energy Saving Appliances. If you've purchased energy-efficient appliances this year, you may be eligible for a tax credit. If you've been transforming your house or condo into a green-friendly haven by installing energy-efficient appliances, you may qualify for credits on this year's taxes. Tax credits reduce the amount of income tax you owe dollar-for-dollar, so they can offer serious tax savings. The amount of credit you receive depends on how much you spent on energy-efficient appliances. The tax credit is 30 percent of the total cost of the energy-efficient appliance, including any installation costs.
