1 Without any kind of fall protection, an employee was walking atop structural steel to check joints and bolts. 2  He apparently slipped or misjudged his footing and fell approximately 20 feet to the concrete floor below, resulting in his death. In steel erection, a new, very narrow working surface is constantly being created as skeletal steel is erected at various heights. For many steel erectors, especially connectors, the work starts at the top level of the structure.
