Hi Megan, You are being charged with a 4 point speeding ticket, which is a $300 fine and an $85 surcharge. If you get 6 points on your license you will be required to pay the DMV fine known as the Driver Responsibility Assessment at $100 a year for 3 years. The DRA is a separate fine charged to you when you reach 6 points against your license in New York. At 6 points you will be fined $100 each year for 3 years. Each point that you get over 6 points is an additional $25
