This is not a law. At one point, NY was having trouble with criminals impersonating officers on traffic stops. The then Governor ordered State Police to stop making traffic stops in unmarked vehicles. This only applied to NY State police, not to county or city law enforcement. There was a bill attempt to pass this into law.
