The type of fatigue matters, too, in pinpointing if or how a vitamin or mineral deficiency may contribute. While iron, for example, might cause an overall feeling of tiredness, a lack of potassium and magnesium can contribute to muscle aches and cause a person to feel sore and weak, Stoler says. All of them can be corrected by giving supplements of the missing minerals or the missing vitamins, he says, or through dietary changes. More serious problems than just the fatigue can develop from these vitamin and mineral deficiencies, Komaroff says.
