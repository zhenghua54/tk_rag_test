surfactant. 1. surface-active agent. 2. in pulmonary physiology, a mixture of phospholipids that reduces the surface tension of pulmonary fluids and thus contributes to the elastic properties of pulmonary tissue. If the surface tension is lowered, the attraction among molecules of the fluid is decreased and the surface area of the fluid increases. For example, if a drop of detergent is added to a drop of water, the detergent reduces the surface tension and the drop of water flattens out. In the lungs, surfactant reduces the surface tension and helps to maximize the surface area available for gas exchang
