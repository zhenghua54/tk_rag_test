Lymphoma. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. One of the first symptoms is swollen armpit, groin, or cervical lymph nodes. Lymphoma falls into two general categories: Hodgkin's disease and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The cervical lymph nodes are some of the best known nodes of the lymphatic system in part because of their role in disease detection. When the body is fighting some sort of major infection, all or at least many of the lymph nodes may swell.
