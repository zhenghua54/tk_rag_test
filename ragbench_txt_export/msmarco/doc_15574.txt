Yes, lung nodules can be cancerous, though most lung nodules are noncancerous (benign). Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan. Lung nodules are usually about 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1.2 inches (30 millimeters) in size.
