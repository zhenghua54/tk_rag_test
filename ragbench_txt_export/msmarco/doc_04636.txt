Etymology & Historical Origin-Theresa. Theresa’s etymology is somewhat uncertain. It is thought to come from the Greek “therizein” meaning “to harvest, harvester” or from the Greek “theros” meaning “summer”. Therasia is also the name of a Greek island. Usage of Theresa as a female given name originated out of Spain and Portugal where it remained largely confined until the Middle Ages.
