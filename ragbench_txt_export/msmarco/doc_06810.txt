I have a 3 pound tri tip sirloin from Costco and the directions say to cook it in a 425 degree oven until an internal temp of 140, but I don&#39;t have a meat thermometer, but even if I did have one, it would have been convenient to know the apprx cooking time. Sear the meat in the roasting pan on top of the stove then finish roasting in a 425 degree oven for about 45 minutes. Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before slicing to allow the juices to redistribute and for an evenly cooked roast.
