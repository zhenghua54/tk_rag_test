Yes, it is possible. The vaccine against parvovirus is not considered completely effective in a puppy until two weeks after the last shot is given; since the last shot is gene â€¦ rally given when the puppy is 16 weeks old, the puppy can usually be considered protected by the time it is 18 weeks old. I believe the current UC Davis recommendation is that puppy gets its first Parvo vaccine at 8 weeks of age, with a booster at 12 weeks and 16 weeks, however your Vet will know the protocol most effectively used in your area.
