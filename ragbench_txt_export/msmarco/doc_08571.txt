Report Abuse. Hoof oil/conditioner is used to maintain the moisture in the hooves, and it also blocks things like mud that suck moisture out. Moist, healthy hooves are less likely to chip and crack than dry, brittle hooves. Hoof oil moisturizes the hooves, giving them their natural flex back and helps prevent cracking and chipping. Hoof oil is not a replacement for proper diet and nutrition which is what could be causing the problems with the horse's feet.
