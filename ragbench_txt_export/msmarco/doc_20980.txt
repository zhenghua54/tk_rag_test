I have never worked with transcription as yet so I donÂ´t know what the usual charges are. Any suggestions are very welcome! When they ask you for your hourly rate (usually it's per audio minute), then you just multiply your rate per minute by 60 for transcription services. When you are asked to not only transcribe, but to translate as well, then it's your hourly transcription rate plus your per minute translation rate times 60
