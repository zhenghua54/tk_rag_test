It is a specific common law misdemeanor, although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person, and may be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances. In the United States, criminal battery, or simply battery, is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful, offensive or sexual contact.
