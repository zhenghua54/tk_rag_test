Characteristics of Filter Foam. Filter foam, also known as reticulated foam, is a porous, low-density type of polyurethane foam with an open cell structure. Filter foam has a near-infinite amount of applications due to the following characteristics: Filter foam, also known as reticulated foam, is a porous, low-density type of polyurethane foam with an open cell structure. Filter foam has a near-infinite amount of applications due to the following characteristics: 1  Compressibility. 2  Cushioning.
