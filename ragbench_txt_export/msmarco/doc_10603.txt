There is a belief that the negative consequences for a single-manglik marriage can be resolved if the manglik first performs a ceremony called a kumbh vivah, in which the manglik marries a banana tree, a peepal tree, or a silver or gold idol of the Hindu God Vishnu. Reality: There is only one planet Mars and hence, one can be either a manglik or not.Neither is there less, medium or high level of dosha. Manglik and Karma. Most Indian religions are based on the ‘Karma’ theory and clearly state that no one can escape the results of their own karma.
