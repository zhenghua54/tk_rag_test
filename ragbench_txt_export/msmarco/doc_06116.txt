A few, maybe. But not the whole Lawn. First, do things that are BAD for Chickweed. Low mowing -- the kind that people do on Colonial or Velvet Bentgrass Lawns, which are naturally VERY short, OR in their Cool Season Grass Lawn -- is GOOD FOR CHICKWEED, i.e., BAD FOR GRASS. This is a ground-hugging Weed.
