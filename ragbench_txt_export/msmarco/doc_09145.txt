In this video, This Old House general contractor Tom Silva explains how to repair vinyl siding. Steps: 1. Cut piece of faded siding from an inconspicuous spot to replace the damaged section; it'll better match the house than brand-new siding. 2. Use framing square and utility knife to cut through face of siding. 3. Pull siding away from house and cut through the bottom edge with aviation snips.
