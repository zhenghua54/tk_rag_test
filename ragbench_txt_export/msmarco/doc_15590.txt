Alanine is a hydrophobic molecule. It is ambivalent, meaning that it can be inside or outside of the protein molecule. The α carbon of alanine is optically active; in proteins, only the L-isomer is found. Note that alanine is the α-amino acid analog of the α-keto acid pyruvate, an intermediate in sugar metabolism.
