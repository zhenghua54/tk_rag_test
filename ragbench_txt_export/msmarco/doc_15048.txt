Pleural disease affects the pleural lining of the lungs. When these thin membranes become scarred and thickened, it is medically termed as pleural thickening. It can be limited to one location (focal scarring) or become widespread (diffuse scarring). Pleural plaque is the other name for focal scarring. Pleural thickening occurs due to the inflammation in the lungs. In addition to asbestos exposure, pleural thickening may occur due to the following factors: 1  Infection. 2  Tuberculosis. 3  Bacterial Pneumonia. 4  Pleural Effusion. 5  Rheumatoid Lung Disease. 6  Tumors (benign and malignant).
