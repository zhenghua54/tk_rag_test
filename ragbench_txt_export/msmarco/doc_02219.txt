Tweet. Basil is used mostly in Arabic, Czech, English, French, and German, and it is of Old Greek origin. Basil is of the meaning royal, kingly. Original forms of the name include Basileios (Old Greek) and Basilius (Latin). Saint Basil the Great was a well known 4th-century bishop of Caesarea whose fame contributed to the popularity of the name among early Christians. The name was also borne by two Byzantine emperors. The popularity of the name saw a substantial revival in the 19th century, promoted by the plant name, which is derived from the same root word 'basileus' for its excellent medicinal qualities. As a first name, Basil shares the same etymology as Rex, which is from the Latin cognate of the same root word.
