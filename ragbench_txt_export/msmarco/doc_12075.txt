Introduction. Eye problems are perhaps the most common or significant symptom of hayfever. When pollen lands on the eye, not only does this irritate the sensitive tissues, but also triggers the release of a chemical called histamine. After your eyes become itchy, they also tend to become red. This is because the blood vessels on the white outer surface of the eye dilate or swell. This is an inflammatory response and is designed to fight off the irritant in your eye. When your eyes are itchy, it is tempting to rub them.
