That is the fundamental relationship between germination and temperature. For every species of seed, there is an optimal soil temperature for germination, and at that temperature, the maximum number of seeds will germinate and in less time than at any other temperature. The effect of soil temperature on sown seeds. The chart below displays the relationship between soil temperature, days to emergence, and the percentage of sown seeds to germinate: As you might expect, the percentage of any seeds to germinate is maximum at the optimal temperature for that species.
