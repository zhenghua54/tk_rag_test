Over the course of the 1st year, you can increase exercise with your Boxer, until he or she is meeting the requirements of an adult dog. A Boxer should have a brisk (20 minutes for a puppy, 30 minutes to 45 minutes for an adult) walk each day, given that the temperatures and weather are not extreme.
