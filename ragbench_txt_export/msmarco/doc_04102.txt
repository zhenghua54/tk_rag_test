Using light and darkness as treatment (less med’s!). Much of the information on this page is new research, not yet repeated by other scientists (it is always a good sign in this business if someone can repeat the study and get the same results!). What’s new is that you can prevent this reduction in melatonin by blocking blue light, with a simple pair of glasses made to block that particular color of light. They let everything else through. Things look pretty yellow through these things, but to your brain, it’s like darkness! What a trick.
