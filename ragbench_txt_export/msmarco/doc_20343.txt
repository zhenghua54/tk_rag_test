The three common polysaccharides are Starch, Glycogen and Cellulose. Starches: While Starches are basically glucose polymers they need the enzyme Amylase to be broken down into glucose or to be digested. Plants store glucose in the form of starches. Glycogen: This is a storage form of glucose which is broken down into glucose when needed by animals and humans. Cellulose: These are polysaccharides that are the components of plants and are used as building material.
