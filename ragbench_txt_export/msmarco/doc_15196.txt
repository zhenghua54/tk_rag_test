A subtype of macrocytic anemia occurs with a normal RDW. One of the reasons for this is something known as aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia refers to a disease where the bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. If both RDW and MCV are elevated, the cause for the anemia may be autoimmune hemolytic anemia, liver disease, or a deficiency in folate, vitamin B9, or cobalamin, vitamin B12.
