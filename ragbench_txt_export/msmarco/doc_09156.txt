Introduction. Epiglottitis is inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis. In most cases, it's caused by infection. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that sits beneath the tongue at the back of the throat. Its main function is to close over the windpipe (trachea) while you're eating, to prevent food entering your airways.
