Water vapor that includes water droplets is described as wet steam. As wet steam is heated further, the droplets evaporate, and at a high enough temperature (which depends on the pressure) all of the water evaporates and the system is in vaporâ€“liquid equilibrium. Steam is water in the gas phase, which is formed when water boils.
