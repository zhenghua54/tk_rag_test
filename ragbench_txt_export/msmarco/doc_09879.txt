Dear Debt Adviser, I am 56 years old and have about $80,000 in student loans from my master's degree, which I completed about eight years ago. The monthly payments are a huge pain now but will be impossible when I stop working. Is there any way to get the balance forgiven by being a senior citizen? After 25 years, any remaining debt will be discharged, or forgiven. Under current law, the amount of debt discharged is treated as taxable income, so you will have to pay income taxes 25 years from now -- when you are a spry 81-year-old -- on the amount discharged that year.
