A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. The antibodies are IgG (immunoglobulin G), IgA (immunoglobulin A), and IgM (immunoglobulin M). They are antibodies that form in response to cardiolipins. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood. The cardiolipin antibodies test is usually just one of many tests given. The tests you get will depend on what your healthcare provider is looking for. For example, if your doctor thinks you have lupus, you will probably need other blood tests.
