My front and backyard are pretty weed free. My side yard has a lot of mouse-ear chickweed. I am not keen on using weed killers like Weed-Be-Gone anymore. I am hoping that one day my cultural practices will lead to a lawn that will choke out weeds. I also don't need a trophy lawn and will tolerate some weeds. I had a thick infestation in a renovated area of KBG. After the KBG woke up and started to grow, it overtook the chickweed really fast. However, I did use weed-be-gone on those weeds so I couldn't say that cultural practices alone took my chickweed out.
