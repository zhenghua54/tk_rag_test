This song was a huge hit for the Irish boy band Westlife. It was voted Song Of The Year 1999 in the ITV end of year phone music poll. In 2003 on the second season of American Idol, the winner Ruben Studdard sang this on the finale and turned it into a #2 hit in America. Then I came up with the first verse and chorus, he added, played it to their producer Steve Mac, and finished the song in about 45 minutes. That's quick for me. There have been occasions where I've spent 45 weeks on a single song..
