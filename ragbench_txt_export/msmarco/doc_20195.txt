Causes of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is caused by an abnormal reaction by your immune system to the protein gluten, found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits. Some people with coeliac disease find eating oats can also trigger symptoms. Coeliac disease is an example of an autoimmune condition, when your immune system mistakes healthy cells and substances for harmful ones and produces antibodies against them (antibodies usually fight off bacteria and viruses).
