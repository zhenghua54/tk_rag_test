What Does a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer Do. Sonography or ultrasound is a technology which uses sound waves of high frequency to detect abnormalities in the body. These waves are capable of penetrating the body and reaching the soft tissues underneath. A computer image is then produced on the screen, which depicts the interiors of the body. Medical sonographers can work in various medical settings such as hospitals, physician's offices, scanning centers etc. As mentioned above, the different job responsibilities of a sonographer include handling equipment, taking images, analyzing results and providing appropriate clinical data for diagnostic purposes.
