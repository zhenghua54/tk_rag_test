In some cases, co-occurring mental illnesses may have symptoms that overlap with BPD, making it difficult to distinguish borderline personality disorder from other mental illnesses. For example, a person may describe feelings of depression but may not bring other symptoms to the mental health professional's attention. While mental health experts now generally agree that the name borderline personality disorder is misleading, a more accurate term does not exist yet. Most people who have BPD suffer from: 1  Problems with regulating emotions and thoughts. 2  Impulsive and reckless behavior. 3  Unstable relationships with other people.
