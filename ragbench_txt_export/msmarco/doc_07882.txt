If you hold the beard of a 2-year-old gobbler under light, you’ll see the tips are mostly amber. When a gobbler is 3, his beard will have grown about 14 inches. However, few toms have beards that long because the bristles wear off at the tip at about the same rate as the beard grows. Therefore, most 3-year-old and older gobblers have “only” 9- to 10-inch beards. Further, their tips will be mostly black because the original amber filaments have broken off. Some hens — maybe one in 20, depending on the location — also grow beards. Typically, hen beards are thin and measure 6 to 8 inches.
