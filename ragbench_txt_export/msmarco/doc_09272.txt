Even though race and ethnicity are socially constructed, people do not always have the ability to choose their race or ethnicity. This is because race and ethnicity are not random. Social class is more important than race-ethnicity in determining a family's characteristics because it reflects the kind of lifestyle a family is living. Social class is also â€¦ a representation of a family's financial capability. Race or ethnicity can represent cultures but not the standards of living.
