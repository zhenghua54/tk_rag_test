In general, ionic and simple molecular compounds that contain carbon are not called organic, partly for historical reasons, but also partly because the category organic is more than just a name-it describes an entire set of bond types, reaction patterns, naming rules, and structure types. The organic/inorganic terminology is mostly very simple: covalent compounds containing carbon are organic. The only fuzzy area is around very simple molecules like $\ce{CO2}$ where the distinction doesn't matter much. So we would not normally think of diamond or silicon carbide as organic.
