The beard is a collection of filaments, or bristles, protruding from the breast of a male turkey, just below his chest. It begins growing when a bird is about 5 months old and continues to grow throughout his life, typically 4 or 5 inches per year. Spring jakes usually have 3- to 4-inch beards, though some early-hatched birds sport 5-inch beards. When a gobbler reaches 2, his beard is usually 8 to 10 inches. A beard gets its black color from melanin, a pigment that colors and strengthens feathers. Therefore, most 3-year-old and older gobblers have “only” 9- to 10-inch beards. Further, their tips will be mostly black because the original amber filaments have broken off. Some hens — maybe one in 20, depending on the location — also grow beards. Typically, hen beards are thin and measure 6 to 8 inches.
