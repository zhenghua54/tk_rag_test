My best friend just had her baby 2 days ago and while i was visiting he went through 2 while eating lol. I am due jan 2 and i would like to know an estimate of about how many onesies and sleep-n-plays i should get without me having to do laundry everyday. I have about about 20 onesies and 5-8 sleep-n-plays that i... So make sure you have enough for at least 5 days,onesies and sleepers. Also, don't buy too many in one size. The newborn size usually only fits for maybe the first month, then they would go to 0-3 mos, etc.
