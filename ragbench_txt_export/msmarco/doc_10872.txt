They send packets to the access point — probably a wireless router — and it sends the packets back to the other laptop. Infrastructure mode requires a central access point that all devices connect to. Ad-hoc mode is also known as “peer-to-peer” mode. Ad-hoc networks don’t require a centralized access point. Instead, devices on the wireless network connect directly to each other. For example, you can create an ad-hoc network from the Control Panel in Windows or create an ad-hoc network on your Ubuntu Linux machine. This is fine if you want to connect two laptops, but it’s very inconvenient if you need to connect a device that only supports networks in infrastructure mode.
