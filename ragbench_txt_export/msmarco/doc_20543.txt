Using Viakal is quite simple, however there are instructions on the back of the bottle which are also accompanied with small pictures. To use the Viakal you spray it onto the surface, wipe with either a dry or damp cloth and then rinse thoroughly with clean water. The Viakal comes in a white plastic bottle, this is wider at the bottom and thinner towards the top which makes it an ideal shape to hold, it also has a blue and white spray trigger on top which can be unscrewed if needed.
