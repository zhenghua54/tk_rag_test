If the hypoglycemia symptoms are severe and the individual cannot treat himself/herself, somebody else will need to apply honey, treacle, jam or Glucogel to the inside of the cheeks and then gently massage the outside of the cheeks. 1 Children with these disorders are more likely to develop abnormally low blood sugar levels than adults. 2  Reactive hypoglycemia (postprandial hypoglycemia) - this is when the pancreas produces too much insulin after a meal. 3  Tumors-tumors in other parts of the body (not the pancreas) can cause hypoglycemia.
