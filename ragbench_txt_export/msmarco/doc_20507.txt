Broiling vs Baking. The temperature of the heat that one uses when using either broiling or baking is the key difference between the two cooking techniques. If you know nothing about broiling and baking, they are both ways of cooking food using an oven. When we look at how heat energy is provided by the oven for broiling, we see that infrared radiation is the process that takes place in the case of broiling to cook the food. Those who know about these two heat carrying processes know that infrared radiation has the capacity to char food items in close vicinity.
