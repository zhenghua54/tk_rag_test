I've done a lot of tiling over the years. The first thing you need to know is that the guy at Home Depot has probably never done one single bit of tile work. That said, if you want to do it right, don't walk on the floor for 12 hours. Wait for another 24-48 hours before you seal the grout. There is a BIG difference between grout being dry to the touch, and being cured.
