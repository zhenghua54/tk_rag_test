Permanent magnet generators (PMG's) or alternators (PMA's) do not require a DC supply for the excitation circuit, nor do they have slip rings and contact brushes. The term synchronous refers here to the fact that the rotor and magnetic field rotate with the same speed, because the magnetic field is generated through a shaft mounted permanent magnet mechanism and current is induced into the stationary armature.
