Rheumatoid arthritis is often referred to as RA. 1  The inflammation in the joints causes joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and loss of function. 2  The inflammation often affects other organs and systems of the body, including the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Although rheumatoid arthritis most often affects the joints, it is a disease of the entire body. It can affect many organs and body systems besides the joints. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic disease.
