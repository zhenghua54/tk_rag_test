The common inch-pound coating weight designations (ordered as A 875) are, in oz/ft 2: GF30 GF45 GF60 GF75 GF90 For Zn-5% Al alloy-coated sheet, since the coating contains about 95% zinc, and thus has nearly the same density as zinc, a GF90 coating is approximately equivalent in thickness to a G90 galvanized coating. No inch-pound designations are used since single side coatings are traditionally ordered in SI units only. Examples are: 60G 70G 90G These designations specify the minimum and maximum SST value on each surface, e.g., 60G requires a minimum of 60 g/m 2 and a maximum of 110 g/m 2 of zinc on each surface for any SST.
