Find a Store: How many miles you get out of a set of brake pads (with disc brakes) or shoes (with drum brakes) largely depends on individual driving habits and the type of driving you do. Also, brake wear depends in part on how much weight the brakes are trying to stop; a heavily loaded van or truck, or a passenger car with 6 adults, will take longer to stop and result in heavier brake wear, than an empty or lightly loaded vehicle.
