Ribosome Structure. 1  Ribosomes in a cell are located in two regions of the cytoplasm. 2  They are found scattered in the cytoplasm and some are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. 3  When the ribosomes are bound to the ER there are known as the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ribosomes link amino acids together in the order that is specified by the messenger RNA molecules. The ribosomes are made up of two subunits-a small and a large subunit. The small subunit reads the mRNA while the large subunit joins the amino acids to form a chain of polypeptides.
