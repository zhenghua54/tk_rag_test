There are several types ofpolyphase motors. The most common type of motor in thisgroup is the squirrel-cage polyphase induction motor socalled because the rotor is constructed like a squirrel-cage(Fig. 7). The squirrel-cage motor is the simplest tomanufacture and the easiest to maintain. – 2 –This bulletin provides basic information on the nature anddesign of polyphase electric motors. The information issimply presented so extensive engineering or electricalknowledge is not necessary for a good understanding. It isdivided into four sections:BASIC MOTOR PRINCIPLES....................
