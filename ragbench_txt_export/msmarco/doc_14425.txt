Couchsurfing International, Inc is a privately owned for-profit corporation, incorporated in 2011 in the State of Delaware by Casey Fenton and Dan Hoffer. In contrast to some published statements, Couchsurfing is not a Benefit Corporation. In August 2011, Couchsurfing announced its change of status to a for-profit corporation. Couchsurfing International Inc refers to two separate legal entities. The first was founded in 2003 as a non-profit organization, and was liquidated in 2011.
