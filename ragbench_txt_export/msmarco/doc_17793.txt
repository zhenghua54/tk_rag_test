During the growing season, you should mow at least once a week. If you fertilize right after mowing, waiting an entire week for the next mowing cycle is a practical choice. But do not let the grass grow out of control by waiting longer than a week after fertilizing. In this case, you can mow directly after watering. A thorough watering across the entire lawn ensures the fertilizer is deeply embedded in the soil, rather than attaching itself to the grass blades.
