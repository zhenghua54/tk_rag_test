A compensation of $3 million per year, or even $500,000 per year, is well above the Silicon Valley average for an engineer. Recruiter Scott Purcell says the software engineers he's placing typically make a base salary of $165,000. The average base salary for a Google engineer is $128,000. But there are outliers besides our $3 million engineer. Twitter's senior vice president of engineer, Christopher Fry, earned $10.3 million last year. Google has an industry-wide reputation for getting — and keeping — the people it wants. The startup made the programmer what it thought was a big offer: a $500,000 salary. He blew us off, said the founder. The programmer told the startup thanks for the offer, but Google was currently paying him $3 million per year in cash and restricted stock units.
