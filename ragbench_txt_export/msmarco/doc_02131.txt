People often associate vehicles such as freight trucks or delivery trucks with commercial vehicles. What you may not realize is that any vehicle being used for business purposes can technically be considered a commercial vehicle that must be insured by a commercial car insurance policy. Commonly insured commercial trucks and vehicles include the following: 1  Passenger car or van. 2  Passenger bus. 3  Minivan. To car insurance companies, the risk of covering any vehicle used for commercial and business purposes is higher than the risk of covering cars used for personal purposes.
