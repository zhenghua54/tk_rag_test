Hi Churchy, You should wait until the walls are completely dry,3-4days.If you are using half water,and half paint you would probably have to put 2 or 3 coats before painting.You can tell better after the 2nd coat,if a third is needed.It does depend on the weather to, if it will take longer to dry. Hoped i help.
