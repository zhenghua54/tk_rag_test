Tools Needed. You will only need a set of basic tools to fix a garage door and, of course, the necessary parts. Generally speaking, basic tools are: 1  Phillips and a regular screwdriver. 2  pliers. 3  adjustable wrench. ' 4 C' Clamp or two (in case of working on the springs). Other Common Issues. Other issues that may come up on a garage door is lack of lubrication. Sometimes the grease in the track will harden and the lubricating effect is gone. What you will want to do is to clear all of this old grease out of the track and replace it with a new coat.
