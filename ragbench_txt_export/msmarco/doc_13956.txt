Gastroparesis is a disorder in which the stomach cannot contract and empty its contents into the intestines in the absence of any intestinal blockage. Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes. It happens when the nerves that regulate how the gut moves food forward in the digestive process are damaged from being exposed to high blood sugar for many years. Consequently, the stomach does not empty out the way it normally would.
