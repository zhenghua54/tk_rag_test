Your RCI Points are made available to you annually, at the beginning of your Use Year. Once you receive your annual allotment of RCI Points, you can exchange them to make reservations at both Points and Weeks resorts, as well as RCI Points Partners for hotels, rental cars, cruises, airfare and entertainment.
