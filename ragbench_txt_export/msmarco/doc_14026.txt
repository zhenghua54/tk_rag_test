Q2.€€€€€€€€€ The electrolysis of sodium chloride solution is an important industrial process. Three useful substances are produced: •€€€€€€€ chlorine gas is formed at the positive electrode; •€€€€€€€ hydrogen gas is formed at the negative electrode; •€€€€€€€ an alkali is left in the solution. €€€€€€€€€ At the positive electrode Cl – €€€€€€€ –€€€€€€€ e – €€€→€€€€€€€€ Cl 2 €€€€€€€€€ At the negative electrode Na€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€ →€€€€€€€€€€€ Na (2) (b)€€€€ Silver halides such as silver chloride and silver bromide are used in photography. The equation shows a reaction to prepare a silver halide.
