When cooking a whole chicken, your greatest flavoring aid is salt. Use at least 1 tablespoon salt for a 3- to 4-pound bird. Sprinkle the salt from several inches above, using your fingers, to evenly coat the entire chicken. Next, season the bird with freshly ground black pepper, to taste. Cook a 3- to 4-pound chicken for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 F. Larger birds and those filled with stuffing take longer to cook. There is no need to baste during the cooking, as it will add steam and may make the skin soggy.
