Hot-dip galvanizing is the process of dipping fabricated steel into a bath or kettle of molten zinc. While the steel is in the kettle, the iron in the steel metallurgically reacts with the molten zinc to form a series of tightly-bonded alloy layers. Once used only for corrosion protection, hot-dip galvanizing is now specified for many reasons including: Surface Preparation.
