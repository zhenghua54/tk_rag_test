Performance status at diagnosis is an important prognostic indicator and is used to determine appropriate treatment, assess how the disease is progressing, and for the statistical analyses of outcome adjusted by performance status. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score was developed to consistently assess the impact of a person's disease on their daily living abilities. Record the ECOG performance status score recorded at diagnosis and before the implementation of treatment.
