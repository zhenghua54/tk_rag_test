Now check the rack for leaks. If you see fluid dripping from the rack, the end seals are leaking and repairs are needed. If no leaks are found at the end seals, check the pinion input shaft seal and the hoses and pump. If a hose connection is leaking, you might be able to fix it by replacing the seals or O-rings.
