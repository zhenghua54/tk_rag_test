You may need to amend the nutrients contained in the soil before you plant an avocado tree. Test your soil to determine the pH and the calcium content. Avocados need a pH ranging from 6.2 and 6.5--if it's not right, your avocado will not do well. You can raise the pH of acidic soil by adding calcium carbonate (lime).
