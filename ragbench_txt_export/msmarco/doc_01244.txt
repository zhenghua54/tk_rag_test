It can take up to six months to eliminate residual cat dander even when the source is gone. If you have taken normal cleaning measures but are still experiencing symptoms, more extreme cleaning may be in order. If the pet had a favorite chair and cleaning attempts have failed, throw it away or donate it. A Winning Wipe Down. Stubborn pet danger clings to most surfaces. Regularly tackle walls, ceilings and baseboards by wiping them down with a mixture of hot water and a multipurpose cleanser. Water is critical, as dry dusting just stirs dander and releases it into the air, exacerbating symptoms before resettling nearby.
