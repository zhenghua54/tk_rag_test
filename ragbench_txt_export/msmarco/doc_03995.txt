Teams like Rochester use much of it, while there are teams that pay players a nominal fee. I believe the OC Buzz paid guys $50 or $100 a game, and they agreed to that and moved forward. Because I know that most local ABA teams go into bankruptcy, and rely on sponsors etc, so I wonder how much do they pay their players. The ones on the court, and the ones sitting on the bench.
