Some of the kinetic (motional) energy in the wind is transformed into waves once the wind hits the ocean surface. Wind energy ultimately forms due to solar energy and its influence on high and low pressure. This is the reason why wave as well as wind power are considered renewable energy sources. The density of the energy that is transported under the waves under the ocean surface is about five times higher compared to the wind energy 20 meter (about 65 feet) above. In other words, the amount of energy in a single wave is very high.
