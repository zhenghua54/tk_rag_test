Instead I used an average human lung tidal volume of 500 ml at a breath rate between 10 and 20 breaths per minute with 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day. Typical resting adult respiratory rates are 10â€“20 breaths per minute with 1/3 of the breath time in inspiration. According to Wikipedia: The average pair of human lungs can hold about 6 liters of air, but only a small amount of this capacity is used during normal breathing.
