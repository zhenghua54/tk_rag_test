Shares & Saves. Save. There is no tax deduction for preschool. You can qualify for a tax credit for preschool payments if you are sending your child to preschool so you can work or look for work. You are out of luck however, if you are a stay-at-home parent that sends his child to preschool because he believes in the benefits of preschool.
