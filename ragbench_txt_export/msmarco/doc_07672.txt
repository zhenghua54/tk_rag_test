Use of ATP usually does not lead to a decrease in ATP levels, due to the very rapid resynthesis. Extreme muscle activity leads to no more than a 20% reduction in ATP concentration in muscles. Only carbohydrates (glycogen or blood sugar) can be used anaerobically. Neither amino acids nor fatty acids can be processed without use of oxygen. Muscles differ in their ability to produce ATP through anaerobic and aerobic reactions. Fast-twitch white muscles with few mitochondria are the anaerobic fibers. Energy production, that is ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi, can occur anaerobically (without the use of oxygen) or aerobically (using mitochondrial reactions and oxygen). These reactions, especially anaerobic metabolism, are quite rapid.
