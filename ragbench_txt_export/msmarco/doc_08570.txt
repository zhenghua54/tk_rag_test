Neatsfoot oil is a yellow oil rendered and purified from the shin bones and feet (but not the hooves) of cattle. Neat in the oil's name comes from an old English word for cattle. Neatsfoot oil is used as a conditioning, softening and preservative agent for leather. In the 18th century, it was also used medicinally as a topical application for dry scaly skin conditions.
