GFRC (glass fiber reinforced concrete) can be used as wall panels, window surrounds, spandrels, column covers, soffits, cornices, brackets, quoins, railings, pilasters, copings, domes, etc. The basic flexibility of use makes this an ideal use for many landscaping jobs. Basically, GFRC is an ultra-strong composite made of Portland cement infused with randomly dispersed glass fibers that reinforce the concrete and increase its load-bearing capacity.
