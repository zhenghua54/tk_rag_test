By default you can stream all the music from your iPhone to your Apple Watch. If you want to leave your iPhone behind, however, you need to sync music over first. Whether you're heading out for a run, hitting the gym, doing rounds, or doing housework, your Apple Watch can hold up to 2 GB of music all on its own.
