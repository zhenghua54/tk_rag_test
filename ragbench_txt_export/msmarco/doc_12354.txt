Located in the upper left region of the abdominal cavity, the spleen's primary function is to filter blood of damaged cells, cellular debris, and pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Like the thymus, the spleen houses and aids in the maturation of immune system cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that protect against foreign organisms that have managed to infect body cells. Lymphocytes also protect the body from itself by controlling cancerous cells. The spleen is a lymphatic organ that performs the valuable function of filtering blood. While it is an important organ, it can be removed when necessary without causing death. This is the case because other organs, such as the liver and bone marrow, can perform filtration functions in the body.
