When the larynx and vocal cords are swollen and inflamed, the result is usually hoarseness or loss of voice. Laryngitis that develops over a short period of time is typically caused by a viral infection, but it can be part of a bacterial infection. A specialist of the ear, nose, and throat can perform tests on the vocal cords to determine the cause of the hoarseness and the appropriate treatment. For most cases of laryngitis, treatment consists of resting the voice box (not talking). Keeping the throat moist and the air humidified can be helpful.
