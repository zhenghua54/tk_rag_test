Step 4-Tighten the Bolts. Using a screwdriver, tighten the molly bolt until it resists tightening. Make sure not to over-tighten the bolts so as not to damage the expandable sleeves of the molly bolts. As you tighten the bolt, the threaded sleeves of the molly bolt expands to anchor on the back of the drywall. Insert the molly bolt pointed-end first into the pilot hole and lightly tap the head of the molly bolt using a hammer. The amount of force that you need to affix the molly bolt into the pilot hole depends on the size of your pilot hole.
