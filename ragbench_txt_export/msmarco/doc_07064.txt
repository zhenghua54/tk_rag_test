Physiotherapy (PT) can be used to maximise a child’s ability to move and control pain in the joints, muscles and bones. It also helps to improve a child’s range of movement in order to promote health and well-being. Physiotherapy is non-invasive and does not involve the use of medication. Physiotherapists concentrate, in particular, on problems that affect muscles, bones, the heart, circulation and lungs.
