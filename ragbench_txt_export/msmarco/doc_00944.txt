1 Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. 2  This feature allows vascular plants to evolve to a larger size than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes. 1 In vascular plants, the principal generation phase is the sporophyte, which is usually diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell. 2  Only the germ cells and gametophytes are haploid.
