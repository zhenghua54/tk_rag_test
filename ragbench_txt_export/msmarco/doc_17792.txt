If you use liquid fertilizer, mow after the lawn has completely dried. Depending on the climate, it could take a few hours to dry. To be absolutely sure the fertilizer has dried into the grass and soil structure, wait 24 hours so you do not cut away fertilizer still attached to the blades. In this case, you can mow directly after watering. A thorough watering across the entire lawn ensures the fertilizer is deeply embedded in the soil, rather than attaching itself to the grass blades.
