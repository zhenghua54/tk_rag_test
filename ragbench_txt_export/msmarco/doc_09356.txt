Federal Laws Regarding Slavery. There are two paths for Federal laws regarding slavery: 1. fugitive slaves 2. free African Americans. These issues intertwine themselves in the early years of the Republic. Slavery is viewed as a local (state) issue so that the U. S. Constitution only mentions slavery indirectly. This act concerned building boats for use in slave trade. Enforcement of this law appears as elusive as the fugitive slave trade laws and further refinements of the act were found necessary.In 1807 Congress passed a law (2 U. S. Stat. 426) against importing slaves into the United States.
