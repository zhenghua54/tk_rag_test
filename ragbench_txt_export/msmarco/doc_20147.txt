They also sell ridiculously cheap embedded systems at routerboard.com. You will hear me talk about their wired implementations most often, but they cut their teeth, and have the highest density of usage as wireless devices. Most of the WISPs in the area use them for their high features and low cost. Mikrotik is a rich man’s all in one router at a poor man’s price. It has a huge feature set including OSPF, BGP, MPLS, VPLS, VPN aggregation, 802.1q trunking, superb firewalling, layer 7 firewalling and policy matching, queueing and much more.
