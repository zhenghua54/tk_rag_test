Most licensed practical nursing (LPN) programs take around a year to complete. While there are very few accelerated LPN programs, this article discusses degree options that can lead to advancements in this profession. Schools offering Nursing degrees can also be found in these popular choices. Generally, you will take courses during the summer that act as a bridge between LPN and RN programs before starting the second year of an RN program in the fall. Some schools will require you to complete up to a year of clinical experience as an LPN before you may enter an accelerated program.
