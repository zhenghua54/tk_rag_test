Balard discovered the element in 1826. One of the very cool physical properties of bromine is that it is the only nonmetallic element that is a liquid at room temperature. Don't let that cool trait overwhelm you. Bromine is a very dangerous chemical, purified or in gas form. Bromine is a member of the halogen family of elements. When you think of bromine, think reddish-brown. Gases with bromine atoms often have a dirty color, they smell bad, and they might make your skin and nose irritated. The name bromine is even based on the Greek word bromos that means something that smells bad.
