Light is an electromagnetic wave and travels at a speed roughly 3 x 10^8 meters/second(m/s) in a vacuum. Since distance = speed*time the time it takes for the laser pulse to travel from the the earth to the moon is, time = distance/speed. For round trip time = 2*(distance/speed). Roughly 2.5 seconds. Let's do the math: The average distance between the moon's surface and the earth's surface is 380,500 kilometers(km). Light is an electromagnetic wave an â€¦ d travels at a speed roughly 3 x 10^8 meters/second(m/s) in a vacuum.
