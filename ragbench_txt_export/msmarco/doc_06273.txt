The PCR process was originally developed to amplify short segments of a longer DNA molecule (Saiki et al. 1985). A typical amplification reaction includes target DNA, a thermostable DNA polymerase, two oligonucleotide primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), reaction buffer and magnesium. If an amplification reaction fails and you suspect the DNA template is contaminated with an inhibitor, add the suspect DNA preparation to a control reaction with a DNA template and primer pair that has amplified well in the past.
