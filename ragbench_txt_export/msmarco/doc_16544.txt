While I do not try to go overboard in saving too much money, I certainly have a target of saving 20% or more of my income every month. This way Iâ€™m able to enjoy the fruits of my labor as well as save for a comfortable retirement in the future. Again, with savings, you have to come to a point where you ask yourself, how much is enough. I tend to save more than the typical 3-6 months of living expenses and feel I should invest the rest but I like having the liquidity at any given moment. Great article. Thanks.
