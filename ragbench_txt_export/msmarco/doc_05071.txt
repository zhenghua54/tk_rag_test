The mesopause, at an altitude of 80–90 km (50–56 mi), separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere —the second-outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This is also around the same altitude as the turbopause, below which different chemical species are well mixed due to turbulent eddies. Within the mesosphere, temperature decreases with increasing height. This is due to decreasing solar heating and increasing cooling by CO 2 radiative emission. The top of the mesosphere, called the mesopause, is the coldest part of
