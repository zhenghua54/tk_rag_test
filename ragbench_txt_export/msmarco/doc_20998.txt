Smell the fish. A mild smell of the sea is normal, but fresh salmon should not have a strong fishy smell. Examine the flesh of the fish. The flesh should be firm and have a shiny appearance. If the flesh is dull, falling apart or appears to be mushy, then it isn't fresh. Rub the scales on the fish. The scales will rub off easily if the fish isn't fresh. Look at the color of the gills--located just behind the head--if it's a whole fish.
