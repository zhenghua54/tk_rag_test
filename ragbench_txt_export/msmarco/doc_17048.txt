by Matt Slick. Cherubim are a kind of angel created by God. They are powerful beings and are among those who were chosen by God not to fall (1 Tim. 5:21) in Satan's rebellion. After Adam and Eve sinned, they were assigned to guard the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:24), presumably so Adam and Eve would not re-enter.
