One incorrect logic is the dielectric in dielectric grease means the grease should only be used to insulate. All greases work by the low viscosity allowing the grease to completely push out of areas with metal-to-metal contact. Some complaints claim dielectric grease is conductive or abrasive, containing silica that increases wear. (It doesn't contain silica). The most frequent Internet complaint is that dielectric grease insulates connections, making connections less conductive. The general basis for this claim is in the word dielectric used in the name. The word dielectric is assumed to mean the connection will have future problems because dielectrics are insulators
