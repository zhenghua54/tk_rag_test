Culture is where we come from, who we are now, and where we are going. Culture is what makes us unique, interesting individuals. Culture is the binding force between your family, friends, and nation. My culture is privileged and high-tech. My culture is fun loving, invigorating, and free; it encompasses high moral standards.
