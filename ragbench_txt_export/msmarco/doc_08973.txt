Checking Flight Status. Your flight may be significantly delayed, meaning it may be safe to arrive at the airport later than you planned. For example, if your noon flight is delayed until 3 p.m., you can get to the airport at 1 p.m. rather than 10 a.m.. Reasons to Arrive Earlier. Consider arriving at the airport more than two hours in advance in some cases. If you do not travel by air frequently and are nervous about the procedures involved, arriving earlier can help ease your mind and give you extra time.
