Mendel conducted both monohybrid and dihybrid crosses Dihybrid cross – initial parents differ in two traits. Figure 3-3 step 3 Mendel’s breeding scheme for a dihybrid cross R/R;y/y r/r;Y/Y: genes are in trans, as above R/R;Y/Y r/r;y/y: genes are in cis Both of these parental combinations = the same F 1.
