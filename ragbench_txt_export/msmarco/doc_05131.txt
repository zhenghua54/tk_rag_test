Giraffes live on only one continent-Africa. These animals are found between Chad in Central Africa and South Africa. Giraffes live in savannas, grasslands, and open woodland. The tall giraffe uses their own elongated neck and tongue to get to the top of African trees. Africa gives the ideal balance of heat, vegetation, and rain to keep the giraffe content for about 25 years.
