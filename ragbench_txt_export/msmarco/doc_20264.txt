Purchasing more than one policy on the same vehicle can be more expensive than adding a driver to your existing policy. Many insurance companies require you to add all licensed drivers in the household onto your policy, so you may be insuring your spouse or child twice if he maintains a separate policy. Save. Most states require all drivers to carry insurance on the vehicles they are driving. The easiest way to insure another driver in your household is to add him to your current policy; however, if you want to maintain separate policies it is legal to do so.
