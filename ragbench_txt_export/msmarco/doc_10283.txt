A syllable is a basic unit of written and spoken language. It is a unit consisting of uninterrupted sound that can be used to make up words. For example, the word hotel has two syllables: ho and tel. Some words have only one syllable, as in hot. Other words have many syllables, as in tem/per/a/ture.
