Different types of titrations such as acid-base titrations and oxidation-reduction titrations have been utilized in chemical analyses. In this experiment an acid-base titration will be used to determine the molar concentration of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Acid-base titrations are also called neutralization titrations because the acid reacts with the base to produce salt and water.
