You didn't mention whether the rice is plain, cooked rice (white, brown, etc), or if it has had other ingredients added to it. That's important. Plain rice will last in the fridge for quite a while--maybe a week. The important thing is to limit exposure to air, which will dry out the rice. The best way is to store it in a zipper-top plastic bag. Squeeze out as much air as you possibly can, then seal the bag.
