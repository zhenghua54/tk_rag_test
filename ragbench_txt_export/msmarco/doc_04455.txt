Baking Soda. Using baking soda is another way to remove rust from metal. You can make a paste by mixing baking soda and water. Make sure that the solution is pasty enough to adhere to the surface, then spread it onto the metal and let it sit. After the rust is loose, you can scrub it off. If you want to remove rust from metal and don't mind a little bit of hard work, you can try to remove it manually with sandpaper or another coarse item, such as steel wool. This might take a while, though. If the rust is widespread, it might take several attempts to get down to the clean metal.
