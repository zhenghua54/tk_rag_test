Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. HDL (good) cholesterol. With HDL cholesterol, higher levels are better. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
