A spiculated mass is a cluster of barbed tissue that is one of the primary indicators of cancer. Rather than a smooth lump, it has spicules or thin, elongated pieces of tissue sticking out from its perimeter. These spiky tumors can appear anywhere inside the body, but are often found in the breasts or lungs. A spiculated mass will be on the periphery of a breast in instances of breast cancer. Radiotherapy, such as with a linear accelerator, might be used to help treat a spiculated mass.
