All numbers in the charts are prices to install tile, apply grout and sealer if necessary excluding materials cost. If installer will buy thin-set or mortar as well as grout the price for installation will increase at $0.9 - $1.9 per square foot. All custom work will be estimated based on its complexity. But if it is a 700 ft 2 basement has to be tiled with the same porcelain tile, an installer typically offers much better deal on labor per square foot and will price the project at $2,800 - $3,100 or $4.0 - $4.4 per sq. ft. Design and layout will have significant impact on the tile installation prices.
