Everyone should have a refrigerator thermometer to monitor temperature. Buy the best quality thermometer that you can afford. To check the temperature of your refrigerator, put a glass of water in the middle of the refrigerator and put the thermometer in it. Wait 8 hours before checking temperature. While maintenance-free for the most part, some things like temperature setting do need attention. For the safest food, your refrigerator should stay between 32 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. According to Home Food Safety, one out of three consumers incorrectly considers the refrigerator dial accurate.
