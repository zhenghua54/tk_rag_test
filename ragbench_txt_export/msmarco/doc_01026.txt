Calcium is available in many forms-calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium orotate, and that just names a few. Coral calcium, a form of calcium carbonate, is exactly what the name implies. It is calcium sourced from fossilized coral sources and is the most common form of calcium on the planet. A small, invertebrate animal polyp secretes a limey substance that hardens into the coral structure. This substance is calcium carbonate. Calcium supplements have become very popular and are generally thought to be an effective way to promote healthy bone density. Indeed, calcium does have benefits but itâ€™s important to understand there are various forms of calcium and they all behave a little differently.
