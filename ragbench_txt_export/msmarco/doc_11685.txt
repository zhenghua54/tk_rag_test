A mobile home's moving cost depends on transport distance as well as the home's width. The HowMuchIsIt.org website says it commonly costs between $2,000 and $5,000 to move a mobile home less than 100 miles. The Manufactured Selling Solutions website, though, says it may cost as little as $1,000 to move a mobile home. If you're moving a mobile home more than 100 miles, expect to pay $6 to $15 per mile or up to $15,000 in transport costs alone.
