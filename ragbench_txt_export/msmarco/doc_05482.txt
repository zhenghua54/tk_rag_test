Lapham Peak has more than 17 miles of loop trails in the forest that vary in difficulty. Trails may be combined to custom-create your own circuit or one-way hike. Most trails are open to hikers in the summer and cross-country skiers in the winter. There is a 2.5-mile lighted loop during winter for night skiing.
