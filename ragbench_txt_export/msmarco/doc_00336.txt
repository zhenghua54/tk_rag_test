Arizona Trail. The Arizona Trail is a primitive long distance trail, nearly 800 miles long, that traverses the state of Arizona from Mexico to Utah. The rail is broken into 43 sections that are 11 to 35 miles in length. Built by the Green Mountain Club between 1910 and 1930, the 272 mile Long Trail is the oldest long-distance trail in the United States. The Long Trail follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont line to the Canadian border as it crosses Vermontâ€™s highest peaks.
