Without question, the best price per terabyte anywhere in the technology industry is the home PC. You can get a DellÂ® PC at about $400 and it comes with a terabyte disk drive. WOW! I found one PC for $319 per TB! Teradata, Oracle, IBM, and all the other vendors are headed for the scrap heap of history with those kinds of prices.
