Cold Sores (Fever Blisters). Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cold sores, sometimes called fever blisters, are groups of small blisters on the lip and around the mouth. The skin around the blisters is often red, swollen, and sore. The blisters may break open, leak a clear fluid, and then scab over after a few days. They usually heal after several days to 2 weeks.
