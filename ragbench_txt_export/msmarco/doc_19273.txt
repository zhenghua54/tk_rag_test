Boats are registered for a one year period. Fees are based on the length of boat and the type of propulsion. All registration needs to be done at the county treasurer's office in the county of residence, not where a boat is kept or primarily used. 1 Non-motorized boats over 12 feet in length must have a validation sticker, but boat numbering is optional. 2  Non-motorized boats 12 feet in length or less are not required to be licensed or numbered. 3  The boat number assigned to your boat can be found on your boat license registration
