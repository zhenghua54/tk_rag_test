A new medication, eluxadoline (MuDelta), is being investigated for the treatment of IBS-D unresolved by diet or OTC medications. This medication targets mu and delta opioid receptors in the GI tract, which are thought to influence proper GI motility, function, and secretion production. 8 IBS-D involves abnormally increased GI motility and secretions, leading to stool urgency and abdominal pain. 2 Altering the function of these opioid receptors may improve symptoms and help regulate colon function. 8 This article will discuss the use of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D.
