Both acts were connected as Kaoma and Chico and Roberta shared the same producer, Jean-Claude Bonaventure, and Kaoma's lead singer Loalwa Braz composed the duo's songs. As part of the Lambada craze, there were two movies released in 1990 that were based on the dance. One was called The Forbidden Dance and the other was simply called Lambada. The Forbidden Dance featured the Kaoma version of the song. Do you remember the Lambada dance craze of the late 1980s? For those of you too young to recall it, the Lambada is a Brazilian dance for couples, which is generally danced with arched legs, with the steps being from side to side or turning, with a pronounced movement of the hips.
