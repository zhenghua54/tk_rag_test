Online MBA programs have existed for more than a decade, but the major publications that rank business schools — BusinessWeek and U.S. News and World Report — have yet to weigh in on the worth of online degrees. For example, most AACSB schools require the GMAT. (Of the 68 AACSB schools with online MBA offerings, a handful will waive the test, but only if you already have an advanced degree or eight years of managerial experience.) MBA-Options.com offers a near-complete list of AACSB-certified online MBA programs.
