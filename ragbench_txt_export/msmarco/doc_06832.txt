The movement of the plates is caused by the convection currents of heat from the Earth's interior. This heat, rising toward the surface through the mantle causes movement of plastic like rock in the asthenosphere, the layer of Earth directly below the lithosphere. The Earth's plates are riding on top of the currents caused by these processes. The main features of plate tectonics are: 1  The Earth's surface is covered by a series of crustal plates. 2  The plates are composed of crustal rock and solid upper mantle which is called the lithosphere. * 3  Plates are composed of continental and oceanic crust
