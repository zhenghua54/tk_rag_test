(a) The negative cathode electrode reaction for the electrolysis of brine (sodium chloride solution). The negative () cathode attracts the Na+ (from sodium chloride) and H+ ions (from water). Only the hydrogen ions are discharged at the cathode. The more reactive a metal, the less readily its ion is reduced on the electrode surface.
