Atmospheric composition. Uranus' atmosphere is predominantly made up of hydrogen and helium. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, these light gases dominate only the outer edges of the planet, but are not a significant contributor to the rocky interior. The dull blue color of Uranus is caused by the presence of methane, which absorbs red light. The seventh planet in the solar system — and the smallest of the gas giants — Uranus has an atmosphere more comparable with Neptune than with Saturn and Jupiter. Known as ice giants, the two most distant planets from the sun have atmospheres that are heavily dominated by ices.
