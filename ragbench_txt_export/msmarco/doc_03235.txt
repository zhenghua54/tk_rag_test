Best Answer: Open the Contacts section, then Add to put the name in your Address Book.. Type in the e-mail address of your friend, with the name and nickname you want to show. Once you send that person an e-mail (use your name as part of the Subject heading so it won't be deleted as Spam), that person will have your address and you can exchange e-mails.
