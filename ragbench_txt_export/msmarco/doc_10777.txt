Snakes... They are known for the one thing-VENOM. There are numerous snakes that can be named under the most poisonous creatures in the world. Amongst those many, the Inland Taipan is perhaps the most venomous snake in the world. The powerful neurotoxic venom of the inland Taipan can inflict death in a matter of 20 minutes. Severe pain, muscle paralysis and coma can result from a bite. The Taipan has enough venom to kill about 50 fully grown humans.
