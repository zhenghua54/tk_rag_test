Plant cell do have ribosomes and they are composed of proteins and ribosomal RNA. The ribosomes in a plant cell are found in the cytoplasm, the surface of the rough e ndoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria and on chloroplasts. There are two types of ribosomes-free ribsomes and attached ribosomes. The ribosomes link amino acids together in the order that is specified by the messenger RNA molecules. The ribosomes are made up of two subunits-a small and a large subunit. The small subunit reads the mRNA while the large subunit joins the amino acids to form a chain of polypeptides.
