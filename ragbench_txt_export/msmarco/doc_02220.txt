Fellow foodies, I seek your help. In the past 10 years or so I've been baffled by the change in the American English pronunciation of the word basil, the aromatic herb. It's derived from the Greek, basilikon, meaning kingly. By the way, most people pronounce Chicago incorrectly. You should say shi caw' go and you should refrain from using the short A that is used in the correct (according to you) pronunciation of basil.
