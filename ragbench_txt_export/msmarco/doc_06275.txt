PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction, a method for amplifying DNA in vitro. Where, in cloning DNA into a plasmid, the DNA is amplified by the bacterial cell when it replicates the plasmid, PCR amplifies DNA in a test-tube. The template is the DNA that contains the target you want to amplify. The primers are synthetic DNA molecules whose sequence matches a region flanking the target you are trying to amplify. It is possible nowadays, to chemically synthesize DNA molecules of any given base sequence, to use as primers.
