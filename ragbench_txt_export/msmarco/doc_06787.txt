Yes, leet is a language, now used by gamers, some deserving of using such a language and some not. As for origins, it started with hackers who DIDN'T create a language when the hacked into Microsoft or whatever shit was put before. Due to it being great to be known as leet, newbies started adopting the term and using to describe themselves, often with numerical variations. Anyone who considers themselves leet should be able to tell you who/what Razor1911 is, anyone failing to answer this question should be laughed at.
