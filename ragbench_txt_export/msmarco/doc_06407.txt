Historical Perspective Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was recognized only after the discovery of GH in 1921; however, this form of proportional dwarfism had been described much earlier. The Update of Guidelines for the Use of Growth Hormone in Children 12 has suggested that GH therapy for GHD be initiated only after an MRI or a computed tomography (CT) scan has excluded an intracranial mass lesion.
