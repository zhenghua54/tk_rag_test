Marble is metamorphosed limestone, composed of fairly pure calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3). Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make reconstituted or cultured marble. Places named after the stone include Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York and the town of Marble, Minnesota. The Elgin Marbles are marble sculptures taken from the Parthenon to Britain by the Earl of Elgin.
