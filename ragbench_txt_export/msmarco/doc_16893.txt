It is rare before the age of 15, but can start at any time after this, most often between the ages of 15 and 35. Psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions) usually emerge in men in their late teens and early 20s and in women in their mid-20s to early 30s. They seldom occur after age 45 and only rarely before puberty, although cases of schizophrenia in children as young as 5 have been reported. .

There are many variations and disorders sharing similar symptoms, and there are causes outside of genetics which can cause schizophrenia and related problems at any age.
