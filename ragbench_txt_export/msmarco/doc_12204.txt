How many doses of hepatitis B vaccine will my baby receive? The basic series is 3 or 4 doses. The first dose should be given in the hospital (at birth), the second dose 1–2 months later, and the third dose at age 6 months or later. A baby who gets infected with the hepatitis B virus during the first five years of life has a 15% to 25% risk for pre­mature death from liver disease, including liver failure or liver cancer. Hepatitis B vaccine is your baby’s “insurance policy” against being infected with the hepatitis B virus.
