If you owe additional taxes, you will get a report from the auditor telling you the amount you owe. You can then set up an installment payment arrangement with the IRS. After you start paying the amounts off, you can contact the IRS to see how much more you still owe on your back taxes. Step 1. Find the tax year that you owe back taxes on and have your Social Security number available. If you filed a tax return for your business as a corporation, partnership or S corporation, then you will need your EIN --your Employer Identification Number. Step 2. Call the Internal Revenue Service at 1-800-829-4933.
