EDTA forms an octahedral complex with most 2+ metal cations, M 2+ , in aqueous solution. The main reason that EDTA is used so extensively in the standardization of metal cation solutions is that the formation constant for most metal cation-EDTA complexes is very high, meaning that the equilibrium for the reaction: Reactions for Complexometric Titration [edit]. In theory, any complexation reaction can be used as a volumetric technique provided that: 1  the reaction reaches equilibrium rapidly after each portion of titrant is added.
