5,635. We ended up specifically listing hardiplank as not complying with the masonry requirement. Look closely at your restriction purposes section and see if it is in the spirit of the ordinance. You might have a purpose like promoting use of high quality building materials or something to that effect. I ask because it is a cementatious fiber board, so it contains cement (masonry), but it looks like wood. And while it lasts longer than wood, especially in humid climates, it doesn't have the longevity of masonry, nor the look, which is the whole purpose of the deed restriction in the first place.
