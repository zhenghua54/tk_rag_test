A fever, also referred to as pyrexia, is an elevation in the body temperature above the norm. This is broadly defined as oral temperature reading above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Farenheit) and a core body temperature (rectally) above 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Farenheit). Variations in temperature may occur depending on where the measurement is taken (oral, rectal, axilla). 1 In infants younger than 8 weeks, a body temperature greater than 38.3 degree Celsius/101 degrees Farenheit should be considered as a high fever and requires prompt immediate medical attention.
