Micturition is the process of excreting excess fluid and substances that have potential harm to the body through the acts of urination and voiding. The renal system is involved in micturition. The kidneys filter excess water and waste products to produce urine. The ureters connect each kidney to the urinary bladder for storage until the time for micturition. When urinating, urine flows from the bladder through the urethra and out of the body from the urethra opening. Micturition is supposed to be a somewhat voluntary reflex.
