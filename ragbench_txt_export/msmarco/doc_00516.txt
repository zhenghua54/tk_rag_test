When Venus is closest to Earth it is only 38 million km away. When Venus and Earth are at their closest approach to each other, it is called opposition. Incredibly, the distance between the planets can vary at different oppositions. 38 million km is the closest opposition possible for the two planets. The distance between the planets can vary by as much as 223 million km during their orbits. Even though Venus is the closest planet to Earth, it is a very inhospitable world. The hottest temperature here on Earth was recorded in the Lut desert in 2005. That temperature was 70.7Â°C.
