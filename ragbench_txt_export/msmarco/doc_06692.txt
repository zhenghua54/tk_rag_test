this stuff is the crak cocaine of the spice world...it works with everything! My favourite is a scoop of hummus, some olive oil in the middle and sprinkle with za'atar...heat some pitta (or any) bread, and dip away mmmm middle-eastern staple! Za'atar can also refer to an herb with notes of savory, thyme, and oregano; however, this herb is rarely exported. Source.
