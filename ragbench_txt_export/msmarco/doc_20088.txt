Criminal law divides crimes into two main categories: felony and misdemeanor. Because state legislatures and Congress define what constitutes a felony and a misdemeanor, crimes that fit into each category may differ somewhat from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general, felonies are reserved for more serious crimes and entail more serious punishments.
