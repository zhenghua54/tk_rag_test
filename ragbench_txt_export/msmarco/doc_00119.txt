Usually a short answer should be no more than 3-4 sentences. The length of essay questions can vary pretty widely depending on how many questions there are on the test and how many are essay questions. Usually short answers means a paragraph or at least several sentences and an essay could require (depending on the class) between a page and a half to four pages. It's always best to ask the professor how much previous students have written that made good grades.
