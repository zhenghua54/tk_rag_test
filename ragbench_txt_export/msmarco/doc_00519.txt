Venus is the answer to ”what is the closest planet to Earth”. It is similar in diameter, mass, and volume, but you can see how it is a scary world compared to ours. There are several missions headed to Venus. The distance between the planets can vary by as much as 223 million km during their orbits. Even though Venus is the closest planet to Earth, it is a very inhospitable world. The hottest temperature here on Earth was recorded in the Lut desert in 2005. That temperature was 70.7°C.
