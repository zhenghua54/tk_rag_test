Carbohydrates provide your body with the glucose it needs to function properly. There are two types of carbohydrates: complex and simple. Foods rich in complex carbohydrates and fiber are called good carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates include foods with added sugars -- these are called bad carbohydrates.
