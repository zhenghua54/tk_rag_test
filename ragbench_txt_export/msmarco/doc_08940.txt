It was so nicely carbonated-bubbles, bubbles bubbles. I want that! My Kombucha has a great flavor, but little to no carbonation. It isn't truly flat, as it still has a little bite on the tongue from the acid/vinegar. I've even tried adding a little sugar when bottling... still no bubbles, not even after sitting for 7-10+ days.
