OSU was one of the early members of the federal Space Grant program. Designated in 1991, the additional grant program made Oregon State one of only 13 schools in the United States to serve as a combined Land Grant, Sea Grant and Space Grant university. The Carnegie Foundation classifies Oregon State University as a research university, with very high research activity and designates it a 'Community Engagement' university. OSU is one of 73 land-grant universities in the United States.
