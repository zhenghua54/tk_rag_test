Colossus. I wouldn't call it a computer either, though some people do: it was a machine specifically for breaking the Lorenz machine ciphers, although by 1945 the programming had become more flexible. But the Colossus was crucial in showing Alan Turing the speed and reliability of electronics. But Alan Turing himself never made a point of saying he was first with the idea. And his earnings were always modest. Picture from a Japanese graphic book of Turing's story. So I wouldn't call Charles Babbage's 1840s Analytical Engine the design for a computer.
