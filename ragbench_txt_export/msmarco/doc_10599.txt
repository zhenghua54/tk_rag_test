Cellular respiration is not the same as breathing. Respiration is  just breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide, but  cellular respiration is a chemical reactio â€¦ n that uses oxygen and  glucose which gives the products carbon dioxide, water, and energy. (1) Glycolysis. (2) Citric Acid cycle or Krebs Cycle. (3) Oxidative phosphorylation. The cell seems to respire in a way that it takes in molecular oxygen (as an electron acceptor) and releases carbon dioxide (as an end product), hence, the process is described to be aerobic.
