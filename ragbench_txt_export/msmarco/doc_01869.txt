2. Use what you know. Make attempts to learn new vocabulary whenever possible, but when youâ€™re speaking, stick to words you know. One of the least eloquent things you can do is misuse a large vocabulary word, or combine too many large vocabulary words and leave your listener confused. 1. Overcome speaking and social anxieties. It will be incredibly difficult to sound eloquent if your voice quivers, you speak too quietly, or you get a stutter when you begin speaking. Take the necessary measures to overcome these social anxieties by visiting a speech pathologist, speech therapist, or a counselor.
