Hay fever affects many people to varying degrees, with symptoms from a mild itch to full blown red eye, oedema (swelling) lacrimation (watering) and the common nasal problems such as runny nose and sneezing. It generally begins in childhood but can develop later in life and some years are better/worse than others. Wraparound sunglasses help prevent the pollen getting into your eyes and relieve the irritation caused by bright sun on an already irritated eye. Rinse the pollen out of your eyes with eyewash such as Optrex, and if you store it in the fridge you get a double soothing effect.
