WIth a roast, you generally want to cook to an internal temperature, not a time. But, when you lay it out butterflied, it’s thinner and more of the meat is exposed to heat, so if you were to cook it at 350 degrees at a 1/2 hour/lb. a 6 lb roast would end up ruinously overdone. Cooking to this temp, then allowing the roast to rest for 15 minutes after removing from the oven, will take the roast to approximately 150 degrees, at which point you can serve it and it will be the juiciest, most tender pork you can get. Don’t mind it if it’s a bit pink in the middle – it’s ok.
