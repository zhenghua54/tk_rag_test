My 7 yr old Maltese had bladder stones. The vet put her immediately on 1 can a day of the Royal Canin So food for urinary problems. Within 2 days my dog was vomiting and having terrible diaherrea. I took her to the vets and found she had developed pancreatitis from too much fat in the dog food. This cost her 2 nights on IV's in the vets, and me, $600.
