Although bismuth-209 is now known to be unstable, it has classically been considered to be a stable isotope because it has a half-life of over 1.9Ã—10 19 years, which is more than a billion (1000 million) times the age of the universe. Bismuth (Bi) has no stable isotopes, but does have one very long-lived isotope; thus, the standard atomic mass can be given as 208.9803987(16) u.
