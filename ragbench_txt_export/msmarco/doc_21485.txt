Tizer is a red-coloured soft drink sold in the United Kingdom. The name originally comes from the phrase 'Tizer the Appetizer'. It was launched in 1924 by Fred and Tom Pickup of Manchester when it was known as 'Pickup's Appetizer'. 'Tizer Ice' was launched in the late 1990s. The drink included menthol, giving it the sensation of tasting cold, even at room temperature. Later branded Ice by Tizer, the product did not sell well and was removed from sale.
