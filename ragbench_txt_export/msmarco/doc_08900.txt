Not only is the Milford Person Lift a cost effect wheelchair transfer solution, itâ€™s also incredibly safe. This safety is due to the Milford Person Lift's ability to transfer a person into a regular auto seat, rather than into the back of an adapted van. If the Milford Person Lift seems like the smart choice to you, one of our friendly Demo Dealers can provide you with a free comprehensive demonstration and advise you on the suitability of a transfer solution.
