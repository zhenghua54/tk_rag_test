Photograph by Sarah Leen. Biofuels have been around as long as cars have. At the start of the 20th century, Henry Ford planned to fuel his Model Ts with ethanol, and early diesel engines were shown to run on peanut oil. But discoveries of huge petroleum deposits kept gasoline and diesel cheap for decades, and biofuels were largely forgotten. Biofuels are similar, except that they're made from plants grown today. Much of the gasoline in the United States is blended with a biofuelâ€”ethanol. This is the same stuff as in alcoholic drinks, except that it's made from corn that has been heavily processed.
