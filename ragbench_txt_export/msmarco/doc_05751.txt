Upon being asked to create a theme song for the film-in-progress, Bricusse and Newley looked at each other and sang out: Goldfinger. . . wider than a mile, to the melody of  Moon River , the successful theme song from Breakfast at Tiffany's. John Barry reacted badly. He hated it, saying That's the worst *** song I've ever heard in my *** life (Saltzman would also dislike Bassey's subsequent Bond theme, that for Diamonds Are Forever). However time constraints did not allow for the possibility of a replacement Goldfinger theme song being written and recorded.
