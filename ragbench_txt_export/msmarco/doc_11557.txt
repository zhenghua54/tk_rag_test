Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with Batman and Robin Eternal #3 and Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis #3. The updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger. Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story The Mightiest Team in the World in Superman #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.
