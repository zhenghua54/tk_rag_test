Renal glycosuria is a rare condition in which the kidneys release glucose into the urine. This condition can cause urine glucose levels to be high even if the blood glucose levels are normal. When too much glucose is found in the urine, the most common culprit is diabetes. Your doctor will probably refer you to an endocrinologist and a nutritionist to help plan the best strategies to get your glucose levels under control. Tell us what you think.
