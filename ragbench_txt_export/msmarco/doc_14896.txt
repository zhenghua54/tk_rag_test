Just because you are summoned to jury duty does not mean that you will actually be chosen to serve on a jury. If you are not chosen then chances are your service will only last that one day. If you are chosen to be on a jury then your service will last until the trial is over. it depends. your service will last as long as the case last. this can be anywhere from 2days to a year or two. Or if you know the person or have any sort of relation to the person on trial you will be excempt from your trial duty. beauteimparfait Â· 7 years ago. Thumbs up. 2. Thumbs down. 0. 1 comment.
