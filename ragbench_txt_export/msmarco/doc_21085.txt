Q-What is the difference in costs between strip foundations with a concrete slab and concrete filled trenches and a slab for a house size 170 square metres? A-The concrete slab applies to both methods of construction and should cost about £3,500. How much of a problem would you expect this to be and what should I be paying for 60 square metres of slab foundations and drains? A-For a 60m2 of concrete slab foundations sized-house you should expect to pay £5,000 to £6,000 for the foundations and slab and about £3,500 for the drains in normal ground conditions.
