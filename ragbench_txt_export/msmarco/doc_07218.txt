The coriolis effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator. 1  The motion of a massive body (projectile, water in an ocean current, air flowing) veers to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the sourthern hemisphere. The strength of the coriolis effect varies with latitude. It is weakest near the equator and strongest at the poles. On the rotating earth, moving bodies appear to curve to the right in the northern hemisphere and curve to the left in the southern hemisphere. This exercise demonstrates how this could be true.
