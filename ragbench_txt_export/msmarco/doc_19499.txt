Its obvious that my wireless mouse is turning my computer on. I simply dont want that to happen. I checked all the wake options in BIOS, as well as device manager. Every device that can wake the computer is disabled in the BIOS, and in Device manager the allow this device to wake the computer option is unchecked. I dont know what else to do to make this stop. My Motherboard is an Asus P5E3. This is a new mouse, Microsoft Wireless Mouse 4000. Thanks
