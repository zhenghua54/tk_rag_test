If your nail fungus infection lingers you should see your doctor to rule out underlying health problems that may be associated with the fungus infection. Because you are the one in control of treatment it is really up to you to decide how long a nail fungus infection will last. These medications are typically taken for three months but it can take up to a year for a new nail to fully grow. Some people use a foot soak for nail fungus infections that is a combination of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.
