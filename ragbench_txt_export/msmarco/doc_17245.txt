The chandelier should be 30 above the dining room table if your ceiling height is 8' and add an extra 3 in height for every foot you gain in ceiling height eg;33 for 9' ceiling 36 for 10' and so on and also the chandelier should be 12 narrower in diameter than the width of the table. That all depends. The general rule of thumb is about 2.5 feet/30 inches above the table. But depending upon your chandelier, your ceilings, and your decor, you can vary it up a bit. I'm roughly 6'4, and a chandelier that low at the table would ruin the dining experience for me! Source(s): http://www.lightsonline.com/how-to-light..
