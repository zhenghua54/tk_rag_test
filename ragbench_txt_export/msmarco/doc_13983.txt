You can get a garage that charges $300 or less on labor for painting a car. However, the paintwork will most likely be sloppy and uneven, and preparation will be nonexistent. For a decent job, most mid range garages will charge between $1,500 and $3,000 for labor. High end car paint jobs cost between $4,000 and $10,000 though they may even go up to $80,000 for highly specialized services. Paints used in this kind of services sell for even hundreds of dollars for one quart.
