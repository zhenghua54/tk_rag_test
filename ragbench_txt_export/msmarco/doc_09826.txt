Breast milk jaundice occurs later in the newborn period, with the bilirubin level usually peaking in the sixth to 14th days of life. This late-onset jaundice may develop in up to one third of healthy breastfed infants. 1 Total serum bilirubin levels vary from 12 to 20 mg per dL (340 μ mol per L) and are nonpathologic. 1, 3, 10 In the term newborn with hemolysis, a bilirubin level above 20 mg per dL (342 μ mol per L) is a concern. 1, 3. The effects of bilirubin toxicity are often devastating and irreversible (Table 2) . 3, 9 Early signs of kernicterus are subtle and nonspecific, typically appearing three to four days after birth.
