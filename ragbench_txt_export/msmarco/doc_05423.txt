1 A 4'-6' tall privacy or semi-privacy vinyl fence typically costs $12-$25 or more a foot for materials, or about $1,300-$3,000 for 100' and $3,600-$8,000 for 300' of fencing, depending on height, materials and if there is a gate or gates. Made with wood, with vinyl or screened chain link, a privacy fence is typically 4'-6' tall and solid, designed to block an area from view. Although it's possible to enclose an entire yard with a privacy fence, because of cost it can be more practical to screen a smaller area, like a patio, pool or hot tub.
