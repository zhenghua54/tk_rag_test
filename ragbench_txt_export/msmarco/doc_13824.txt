However, there are some herbs like ginger and cilantro, that are also used in Mediterranean-style cooking as well. Today I’ll be sharing the most commonly used fresh herbs in Mediterranean-style cooking that I like to use in many of my recipes here at Carrie’s Experimental Kitchen. Basil. 1  Originates from southern France and Italy and comes from the mint family. 2  Has a sweet, peppery taste. 3  Can be used in a variety of dishes like pesto, sauces, soups, salads, marinades and dressings. 4  Basil blends well with other herbs and spices such as parsley, rosemary, oregano, thyme, sage, and saffron.
