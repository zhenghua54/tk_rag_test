Aim for 2,300 milligrams of sodium or less per day. Evidence shows that consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is a risk factor for stroke. High blood pressure can also lead to heart disease, kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Most Americans will benefit from a lower sodium diet. Look for foods that have fewer than 200 milligrams of sodium per serving. Look for low sodium on the food label; this means the food has fewer than 140 milligrams of sodium per serving. Eat more fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium.
