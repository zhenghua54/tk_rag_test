Astaroth is undoubtedly one of the oldest demons as well as one of the most powerful and respected. She was an early goddess among the Sumerians, known to them as the Queen of Heaven. Astaroth is something of a politician among the demons. She counsels both humans and demons alike, but only those humans who still believe in her as a goddess. She can help one gain a good reputation and can create friendships between her followers and people with power and status in society.
