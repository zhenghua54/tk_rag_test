To apply for benefits, or for information about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, contact your local SNAP office. You can find local offices and each State's application on our national map. Local offices are also listed in the State or local government pages of the telephone book. The office should be listed under Food Stamps, Social Services, Human Services, Public Assistance, or a similar title. You can also call your State's SNAP hotline number. Most are toll-free numbers.
