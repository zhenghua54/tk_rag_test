Genotype-phenotype distinction. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The genotypeâ€“phenotype distinction is drawn in genetics.  Genotype  is an organism's full hereditary information.  Phenotype  is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. This distinction is fundamental in the study of inheritance of traits and their evolution. An organism's genotype is a major (the largest by far for morphology) influencing factor in the development of its phenotype, but it is not the only one. Even two organisms with identical genotypes normally differ in their phenotypes. One experiences this in everyday life with monozygous (i.e. identical) twins.
