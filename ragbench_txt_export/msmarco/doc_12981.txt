~ Fermentation and cellular respiration differ in that fermentation does not require oxygen while cellular respiration does. Fermentation and cellular respiration are also different because water molecules are not produced during fermentation but are produced during cellular respiration. All fermentation reactions occur in the cell's cytoplasm but during cellular respiration, only glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm. ~ Fermentation and cellular respiration are alike in that they both begin with a series of reactions known as glycolysis, which breaks glucose molecules into smaller pyruvate molecules. They are also similar in that during both processes, ATP is produced for the cell to use.
