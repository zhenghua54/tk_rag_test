Depends on the store, of course, but it's around $10-12 per pound, uncooked. Pork Baby Back Ribs at my Butcher in SW Michigan, USA are only $2.99 Lb. Remember this is the World Wide Web not your Neighborhood Web, cost in other area and countries will vary. Prices will vary from season to season and supply & demand.
