So you are looking at about 15 hours for just the house. Most people cannot clean more than 5 hours in a day because it is so strenuous. High cost of living areas charge $30 an hour. Low cost of living areas can charge between $5 and $10 and hour. I clean a 3 bedroom house with kitchen, living room, den, game room, and 2 bathrooms. I mop, sweep, vacuum, do lots of dusting, wash some clothes, and whatever dishes are in sink wash by hand. I've been charging the same price for about 5 years; once a month for $150.
