A chiasma is a point of contact between sister chromatids that forms during meiosis, a process of cell division and replication used by a wide variety of organisms. At the chiasma, the chromatids can exchange genetic information, resulting in new combinations of genetic material. When the chromatids separate and become sister chromosomes, they will contain a different mix of genetic material than their parent chromosomes.
