Digitalis (Foxglove) -- The tubular flowers attract hummingbirds, and the plants grow in full sun or part shade. I was surprised to see a hummingbird sipping on the pale yellow Digitalis lutea. That's what I call hummingbird broccoli. Eupatorium maculatum (Joe-Pye Weed) -- A native perennial that blooms in the fall. Ipomoea (Morning Glory) -- Hummingbirds are more attracted to the red varieties like Ipomoea luteola, but all colors are good. Ipomopsis rubra (Standing Cypress) -- Chocolate cake for hummingbirds. Liatris (Blazing Star) -- Tall spikes of purple flowers for hummingbirds and butterflies.
