How long is a horse pregnant? The period of gestation is the time starting when a baby is conceived in the womb until it is born. A horses' gestation period is roughly 11 months (or 340 days). Of course, a pregnant mare is never that predictable :D so a range of 320 to 370 days is considered fairly normal. Posted by ~ Melanie ~ at 6:53 AM.
