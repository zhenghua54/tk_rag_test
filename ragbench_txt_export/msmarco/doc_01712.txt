Answer: No — it’s not necessary to refrigerate an opened jar of commercially manufactured peanut butter, says the National Peanut Board. An opened jar of processed peanut butter will usually keep well for about 3 months when stored in a dark cupboard at normal room temperature. And the major benefit of pantry storage, of course, is that it allows the peanut butter to spread more easily.
