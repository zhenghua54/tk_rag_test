De Thierry had plans for the systematic colonisation of New Zealand, similar to those ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. It was not until 1837, 15 years later, that de Thierry arrived in New Zealand to claim his land. During this long lapse of time the M&#257ori chiefs from Hokianga had sold portions of de Thierry's land to other Europeans, who settled the land and thus brought economic opportunities to the local people.
