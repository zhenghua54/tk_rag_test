When screening for tenants, I typically require: Be careful not to screen out tenants based on any of the protected classes, or you could find yourself in a lawsuit or sitting in a jail cell. This may come off sounding a little harsh, but I believe the vast majority of landlords out there are absolutely terrible. Your job as a landlord is to be fair, not to be nice. Being nice will give your tenants and others the invitation to walk all over you and take advantage at every turn. But Brandon they say It was Black Friday and I really needed that big screen TV. I get paid again in two weeks.
