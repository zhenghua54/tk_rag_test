About. I’m sure you know about Roquito Peppers. If you like pizzas, or have ever eaten one in the UK, then its likely that that spicy little number that tickled your tastebuds was a Roquito Pepper. Although don’t confuse us with that horrible dry green thing that offended you – that was most likely a green jalepeno! The green jalepeno is everywhere, but really cannot compete with the flavour, crunch and aftertaste of a spicy little Roquito Pepper.
