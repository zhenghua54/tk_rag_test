But these blood vessels are different from all the other blood vessels in our body. They are lined by a strange structure called the blood-brain barrier. It closely controls what is, and is not, allowed to leave the blood supply and enter the brain. It's your own personal customs and border security. We can now see that the blood-brain barrier is not just a flyscreen with little holes in it, but a vital organ made of many different types of cells. The anatomy and micro-anatomy is astonishing. The blood vessels in the brain (and in the spinal cord as well) are lined on the inside with specialised endothelial cells.
