A refrigerator with a top freezer will weigh differently than one with a bottom freezer. A side-by-side refrigerator will also weigh in at a different number. Additional features such as an icemaker or water unit can cause the weight of the refrigerator to vary. On average, a full size refrigerator (18+ cubic feet) weighs 250-350 pounds. More Info: The range in weights of refrigerators is dramatic with a few lightweight models weighing less than 175 pounds while a Sub-Zero refrigerator can weigh up to 800 pounds. Most refrigerator models fall between 250-350 pounds.
