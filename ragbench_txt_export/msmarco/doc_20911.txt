Read the entire poem aloud to hear how the rise and fall of its rhythm mimics the rise and fall of the tide. Paraphrase each line: The tide rises, the tide falls, The twilight darkens, the curlew calls; Along the seaÂ­sands damp and brown The traveler hastens toward the town, And the tide rises, the tide falls. Darkness settles on roofs and walls, But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls; The little waves, with their soft, white hands, Efface the footprints in the sands, And the tide rises, the tide falls.
