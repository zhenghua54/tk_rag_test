.. Restaurants and meat purveyors that specialize in medium-rare cuts of Top Sirloin slow roast at temperatures of 170-215* for up to 20 hours. The general rule is about 20-25 minutes per pound @ 225 for rare to medium-rare, but I find you usually have a little more leeway without fear of over-cooking. Cook's Illustrated considers Sirloin Top Butt/Tip Roast to be the poor man's Prime Rib. Slow roasting is how companies like Boar's Head and Thumann's prepare their deli meats ....usually for 8-10 hours @215-225*.
