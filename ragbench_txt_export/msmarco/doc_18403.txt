According to USDA, ribs are done when they are 145째F internal temp, but they may still be tough. If you take them up to 180째F, drop the oven temp to about 180째F and hold them at this temp for about 30 minutes, the collagens and fats melt some more at this temp and make the meat more tender and juicy. On most cookers, when the oven temp is 225째F at sea level, it takes about three to four hours to cook a slab of baby backs and about five to six hours to cook a slab of St. Louis cut ribs or spares. They are slightly undercooked at that stage.
