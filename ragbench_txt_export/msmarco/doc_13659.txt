Shandong Weihai, A Garden-like City by the Sea. Weihai, dubbed China’s “Garden City”, rests along the shoreline in the northeastern section of Shandong. This coastal city boasts lush forests, picturesque islands, and more than 600 miles of beachhead. Lying at the eastern foot of Naigu Mountain in Weihai City, this park offers green trees and fresh flowers that bloom all year round. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, many men of letters climbed the tower and wrote poems to praise it. The park is a best spot for viewing the sunrise.
