NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- JetBlue Airways ousted its founder from his CEO job Thursday, three months after the service problems that stranded passengers on grounded jets for hours dented the airline's reputation for customer service. Knowing that Dave Barger was ready to succeed him as CEO, the board suggested to Dave Neeleman that he could best serve the company as a strategic visionary, JetBlue spokeswoman Alison Eshelman said Thursday morning. Shares of JetBlue (Charts) jumped about 5 percent in midday trading on the news.
