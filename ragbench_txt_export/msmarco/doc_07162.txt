I'll Fly Away , is a hymn written in 1929 by Albert E. Brumley and published in 1932 by the Hartford Music company in a collection titled Wonderful Message. Brumley's writing was influenced in part by an older secular ballad. In a history given by the current Chuck Wagon Gang, their recording of I'll Fly Away is described as the first commercially licensed release.. Their recording appears to have had two releases on Columbia, first as a B-side in 1949, then as an A-side in 1950.
