This hybrid of two oceanic dolphin species is extremely rare. They've been reported to exist in the wild, but only one is known to exist for sure. Her name is Kekaimalu, and she's a resident of Hawaii's Sea Life Park. She's had viable offspring with other bottlenose dolphins, though only one has survived into adulthood.
