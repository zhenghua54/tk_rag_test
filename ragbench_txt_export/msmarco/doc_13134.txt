The third way of becoming a registered nurse is by attending a college or university for a bachelor’s degree in nursing (BSN). Unlike the ADN, which takes two years to accomplish, this degree requires four years, unless the student already holds a bachelor’s degree. Indeed, many nurses feel it is more of a calling than a career per se; they are driven to provide care to those who need it. Few other professions, if any, afford the opportunity to care for a multitude of other people to such an extent as nursing.
