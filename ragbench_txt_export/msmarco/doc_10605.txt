The placement of ‘Mangal’ (Mars) in the horoscope is the main parameter for consideration of ‘Manglik dosha’. A person can be considered ‘Manglik’ if Mars is placed in his horoscope in the ‘Lagna’ (Ascendant), the Fourth House, the Seventh House, the Eighth House or the Twelfth House. Some astrologers and astrological texts consider the Second House also for judging ‘Manglik dosha’.
