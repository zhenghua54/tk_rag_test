The Harlem Renaissance had many lasting effects-- such as creating a pathway for the Civil Rights Movement some 20 years later and inspiring artists to create jazz, authors and poets and playwrights to create pieces of literary work that are now considered classics in literature, etc. It rejected Europeans and  white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and  creativity. It had a profound effect around the U.S.    The epicenter of the Harlem Renaissance was the West Harlem  neighborhood in New York City (Upper Manhattan).Stupid.
