The performance appraisal interview is the first round in the performance appraisal process and this is the round in which the manager communicates his evaluation of the employees performance during the appraisal period or the time that the employees performance is being evaluated. The performance appraisal interview must be taken seriously and both the employee and the manager must set aside time to go through the process. The manager cannot arbitrarily change the time or the venue and must not approach the interview in a haphazard manner.
