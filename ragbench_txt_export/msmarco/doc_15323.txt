Thyroiditis refers to an inflamed thyroid. Your thyroid is a gland in the front of your neck that controls your metabolism by releasing a variety of hormones. Most types of thyroiditis do not cause pain in the thyroid gland. Subacute thyroiditis generally occurs after an upper respiratory viral infection such as the flu or the mumps. The mumps is a highly contagious viral infection that causes inflamed salivary glands.
