Just Under 6 Feet. A review of the European soccer labor market conducted by the International Centre for Sports Studies in Switzerland collected demographic and physical data on professional soccer players, published in 2009. Their average height was 5 feet, 11 1/2 inches tall. Germany's pros average 6 feet at the tallest end of the spectrum, and Spain's are the shortest at 5 feet, 10-3/4 inches. Soccer players range between Messi and van der Sar in height and overall physique. An exception would be a tall, thin player such as Englishman Peter Crouch, a journeyman who has played on more than 10 teams. He stands at 6 feet, 7 inches, and weighs only 156 pounds.
