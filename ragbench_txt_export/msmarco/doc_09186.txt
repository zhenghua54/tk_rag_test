The aortic valve (1) is one of four valves in the normal heart. It sits between the left ventricle (2) and the aorta (3). Heart valves are thin flaps of tissue anchored in a fibrous ring. The normal aortic valve has 3 leaflets (4) that open to allow blood to move forward and close to prevent backward blood flow.
