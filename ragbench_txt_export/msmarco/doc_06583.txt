When to Apply to a U.S. Consulate. On the one hand, you donâ€™t want to apply for your visa too early. The U.S. embassy or consulate will not be able to issue your visa earlier than 120 days before the start of your school admission, as measured by the program start date shown on your Form SEVIS I-20. You will be allowed to enter the U.S. no more than 30 days before that date. In that case, you will not be dealing with a U.S. consulate, but with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), in the United States. You will need to check into how long the USCIS office that will handle your request is taking to process Forms I-539, for a change of status.
