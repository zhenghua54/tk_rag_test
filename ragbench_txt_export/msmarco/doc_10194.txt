An adjective is a word that defines, qualifies or modifies the meaning of a noun, or more rarely of a pronoun. It expresses the qualities or attributes of the word it qualifies. There are two main categories of adjectives: a) determining adjectives, and b) descriptive adjectives. Here are some examples. Many qualifying adjectives can be used in a comparative or a superlative form. In most cases, the comparative form of an adjective is made with the word more, and the superlative form with the word most.
