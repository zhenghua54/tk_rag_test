There are a number of herbicides, however, that will kill chickweed on contact and are best used in early spring to prevent seeds from germinating. Glyphosate herbicide (Round-up) can be used to eradicate chickweed, attacking the root system and killing the entire plant. Once you do begin to water, continue to do so each day for about two to three weeks. Any leftover chickweed should begin to die while new grass replaces it. Whether you choose to eradicate chickweed manually or with an herbicide is up to you. However, the best way to kill chickweed is before it has time to set seed.
