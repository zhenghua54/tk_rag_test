Eggs, Cheese, and Milk. Eggs, cheese and milk are all protein-rich. In fact, like meat, they offer all of the essential amino acids necessary for human health, thus are complete protein foods. One whole egg, 1 cup of milk (skim, 2 percent, or whole), and 1 ounce of most varieties of cheese provide 8 grams of protein. Some nuts are an excellent source of protein. Almonds are particularly protein-rich, providing 6 grams per ounce. Other nuts that provide between 5 and 6 grams of protein per ounce include Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts and walnuts.
