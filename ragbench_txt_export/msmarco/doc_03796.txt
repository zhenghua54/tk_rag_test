In 1983, the Turkish-held area declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. So far, only Turkey recognizes the TRNC, while all other governments and the United Nations recognize only the government of the Republic of Cyprus over the whole island. Cyprus' main airport is Larnaca International Airport (LCA) and is on the outskirts of Larnaka. The previous main international airport located SW of Nicosia is now located on the Green Line separating the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus-it has been out of use since 1974.
