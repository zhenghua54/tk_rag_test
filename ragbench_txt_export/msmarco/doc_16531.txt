This is the “Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion” (VSEPR) Theory. Thus, the “Electron Group” geometry of each central atom in a structure can be determined by simply counting the number of “groups” of electrons around the atom, then considering how those groups would arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. A “ group ” of electrons can be a single bond, double bond, triple bond, or a lone pair of electrons. The table below indicates the “Molecular Geometry” of the central atom depending on whether the groups of electrons around it are covalent bonds to other atoms or simply lone pairs
