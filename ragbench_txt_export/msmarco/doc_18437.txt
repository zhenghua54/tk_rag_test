The receptors match only one specific antigen. White blood cells called lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow but migrate to parts of the lymphatic system such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus. There are two main types of lymphatic cells, T cells and B cells. Once activated, helper T cells start to divide and to produce proteins that activate B and T cells as well as other immune cells. The killer T cell is specialized in attacking cells of the body infected by viruses and sometimes also by bacteria. It can also attack cancer cells.
