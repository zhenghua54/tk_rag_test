Students are considered undergraduate if they are seeking to obtain a certificate, associate or bachelor degree. Most bachelor (BA, BS, BFA etc) programs take 4 years to complete. Once you have completed a bachelor's degree, you can go on to a graduate program. Graduate programs are shorter (one to two years).
