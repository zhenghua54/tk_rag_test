Scar formation, the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads to thickening of the walls, and causes reduced oxygen supply in the blood. As a consequence patients suffer from perpetual shortness of breath. Pulmonary fibrosis (literally scarring of the lungs ) is a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems.
