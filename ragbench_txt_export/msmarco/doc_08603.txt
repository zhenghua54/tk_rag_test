Saracens are a professional rugby union team based in London, England – although they formerly played their home games at Vicarage Road, in Watford just outside of the capital. The team returned to London during the 2012–13 season, when they relocated to their newly built and renovated Allianz Park. Special games played at Bramley Road during this period include the 1971 match against a select International XV. It was a fantastic occasion, as a 5,000 strong crowd (the largest ever to watch a rugby union game in North London at the time) came to watch a magnificent contest, ending Saracens 34 International XV 34.
