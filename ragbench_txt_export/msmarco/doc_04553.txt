The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies (NACCRRA). Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages. And daycare – whether in a center or in someone's home – could cost double or triple per month in a relatively expensive city compared to a cheaper area.
