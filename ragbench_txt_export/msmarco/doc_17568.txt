This article is about the FA of Northern Ireland. For the FA of the Republic of Ireland, see Football Association of Ireland. The Irish Football Association (IFA) is the organising body for association football in Northern Ireland. It originally organised the Ireland national football team which, after 1921 or 1950, depending on which event is taken as the significant factor, became the Northern Ireland national football team. The IFA was formed in 1880 by seven football clubs mostly in the Belfast area, as the organising body for the sport across all of Ireland. A meeting was called by Cliftonville of other football clubs that followed the rules set out by the Scottish Football Association (SFA).
