Re: How Long is a Judgment Good For. If the judgment has been satisfied, the judgment creditor should file a satisfaction of judgment with the court. If that happened, then the judgment is a done deal. If not, and you're certain you paid off the judgment, you can file a motion with the court asking that the defendant be ordered to file the satisfaction of judgment or that the court otherwise find that the judgment was satisfied. 03-06-2012, 02:02 PM #3.
