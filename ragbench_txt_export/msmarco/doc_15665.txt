In comparison, acquisition costs for IMRT systems range from $1.8 million to $5.4 million, according to a 2009 report by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) on management options for low-risk prostate cancer. The cost of therapy is also an issue. For a 65-year-old man with localized low-risk prostate cancer, the average lifetime cost of treatment with IMRT is $43,122 and with proton-beam therapy is $59,979, according to the ICER report. Proton-beam therapy is not new, but its use for medicinal purposes has greatly increased during the past decade. Much of the controversy related to this treatment arose because of cost. The cost to construct and equip a facility to provide proton-beam therapy ranges from $25 million to $150 million.
