This is the average and does not include shore excursions. They range in price from about $20 to $500 per person. Of course you don't have to take any shore excursions either. Of course you may get a cruise for much cheaper. So much depends on the cabin you get, and where your going. I would guess that about $100 per person per day would be an accurate price. Also, you need to pay gratuities, a soda pass, and any shore excursions. I went on a 8-day cruise to Mexico for 4 people and the total cost after everything came to about $5,000 on Carnival.
