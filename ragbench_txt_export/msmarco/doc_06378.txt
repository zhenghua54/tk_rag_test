The undissociated form of the indicator is a different color than the iogenic form of the indicator. An Indicator does not change color from pure acid to pure alkaline at specific hydrogen ion concentration, but rather, color change occurs over a range of hydrogen ion concentrations. So simply: the funciton of an indicator in a titration is to provide a visual cue to indicate the end point or change in pH in the solution.
