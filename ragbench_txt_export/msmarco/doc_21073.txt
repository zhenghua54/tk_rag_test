Passionate about all things Australian. Toads are carnivores and do not eat vegetation, except when they are tadpoles, when they eat freshwater algae and other water plants. Adult toads eat insects and invertebrates, such as flies, grasshoppers, spiders, beetles, crickets, grubs, slugs, centipedes, millipedes and worms. Larger types of toad, such as cane toads, are big enough to eat small rodents like mice as well, and small lizards. Since their introduction to Australia, cane toads have posed a great threat to native frog species, eating them as well.
