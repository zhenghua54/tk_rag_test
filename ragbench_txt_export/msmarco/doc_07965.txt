Enteropathic arthritis develops in approximately 9% to 20% of people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, which are types of inflammatory bowel disease. These disorders cause episodes of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Physicians treat enteropathic arthritis with medications similar to those used in rheumatoid arthritis, including NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and anti-TNF medications (see “Medications for rheumatoid arthritis”).
