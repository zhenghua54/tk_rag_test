The Inuit live throughout most of the Canadian Arctic and subarctic in the territory of Nunavut;  Nunavik  in the northern third of Quebec;  Nunatsiavut  and  NunatuKavut  in Labrador; and in various parts of the Northwest Territories, particularly around the Arctic Ocean. Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, who emerged from western Alaska, after crossing from Siberia, around 1000 CE and spread eastwards across the Arctic. They displaced the related Dorset culture, the last major Paleo-Eskimo culture (in Inuktitut, called the Tuniit).
