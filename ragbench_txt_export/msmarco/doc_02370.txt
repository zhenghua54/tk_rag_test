After 6 years of trying to conceive we are finally pregnant. 4th iui cycle but follie ovulated itself. We are expecting twins non identical own sacs and own placenta. Someone told me oh you had to have had 2 follies for this to happen. I am trying to find out of it is possible for 1 follicle to have 2 eggs.
