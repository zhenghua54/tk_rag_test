When it comes to mining coal, there are two processes by which coal can be removed from the ground: surface mining, or underground mining. In Australia, the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method, although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1. Whether it is underground mining, or surface mining, the use of quality conveyors in the coal industry is imperative to maintaining efficiency. FEECO has been involved with the coal industry for decades, providing superior quality conveyor systems, bucket elevators, belt trippers, and belt plows.
