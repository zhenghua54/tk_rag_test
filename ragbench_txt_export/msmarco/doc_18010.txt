The most common cause of muscle cramps is injury of the muscles or the bone to which the muscles are attached. In the case of muscle spasm in back, an injury to the spine will cause back muscles to contract as they try to provide more support to the injured bone area. Similarly, when the muscles, themselves, are injured, they will spasm or contract in order to protect themselves. Some medication can also cause muscle cramps
