Akabane promptly tells Ginji he has been chosen as he welcomes him to the town of the creators Babylon City. The version of Akabane in Babylon City reveals to Ginji that he is a surgeon and his last name is actually written as 赤羽. Kyoji Kagami refers to Akabane as Babylon City's Kuroudou Akabane, so it is safe to assume he was, at one point, a resident of the upper towers. His reason for leaving is never revealed but it may be that he was bored.
