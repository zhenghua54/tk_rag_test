If your greenhouse is in a warmer climate, increasing roof height helps keep warmer temperatures away from tomato plants. Proper ventilation is important to help keep temperatures under control. Greenhouses need an effective ventilation system to maintain air circulation. During the day, greenhouse temperatures should stay between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures in this range encourage plant growth and fruit production. This range also discourages development of certain fungal diseases like gray mold.
