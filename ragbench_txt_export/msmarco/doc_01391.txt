Comments and insights on the name Bastian: | Edit. Share what you know! Personal experiences with the name Bastian: | Edit. My sons name is Bastian Bronx and everyone always comments on how lovely it is to meet a Bastian instead of Sebastian. We've got used to calling him Bash now. You can toss all that away now, because elegance has gone mainstream. This paragon of sophistication is now a global hit, and pals like Adrian and Julian will admire Sebastian's classic style.
