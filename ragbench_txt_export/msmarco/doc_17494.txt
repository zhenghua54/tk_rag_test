The ethylene content is around 45% to 85%. The higher the ethylene content, the higher the loading possibilities of the polymer, better mixing, and extrusion. Peroxide curing these polymers gives a higher crosslink density compared with their amorphous counterpart. The amorphous polymer is also excellent in processing.
