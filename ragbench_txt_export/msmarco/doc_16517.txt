EXAMPLE: Linked and Unlinked OneDrive folder on PC NOTE: This is the OneDrive folder that is a copy of your OneDrive downloaded to and synced on your PC. Here's How: 1. Sign in to your user account on the Windows PC that you want to unlink OneDrive from. 2. Note When you unlink OneDrive, it will not remove the PC from OneDrive.com. If you are signed in to Windows 8 with a Microsoft account that is the same one used to sign in to OneDrive.com when setting up the OneDrive desktop app, then you will not be able to unlink OneDrive.
