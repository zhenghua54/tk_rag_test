I am 15 and about 2 years ago i fell out of a loft and have had back pain ever since, i had an MRI scan and today i got the results; the lower part of my spine is bruised. The consultant said that they don't know how long it will take to heal and its a very very rare case. It really depends on the bone and the extent of the bruising. I have recently had bruising to my first metatarsal and after 2 weeks of going non weight baring it healed. To be honest it seems rather odd that your spine is still bruised after 2 years.
