Cupro-The European cousin of tencel, Cupro is also somewhat similar to rayon in that it is reprocessed cellulose. Like tencel and rayon, the base material for cupro is a regenerated cellulose fiber. In this process, the wood pulp or cotton liners are dissolved in an ammoniac copper oxide solution. Cupro fabric breathes like cotton, drapes beautifully, and feels like silk on your skin. Its slinky, curve-hugging drape makes it great for elegant dresses and blouses.
