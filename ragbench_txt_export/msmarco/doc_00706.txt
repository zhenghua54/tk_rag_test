Report Abuse. As a long time GSD breeder who exhibits my dogs, I charge $600.00-$750.00 pet/companion. Show/competition/breeding prospects are $1000.00-$2000.00. and must be ofa'd hip and elbows BEFORE they can be used in any breeding program. I also encourage my dog buyers to check for thyroid, pancreas, cardio function.
