A fjord is a narrow, high-walled, and very long submerged glacial valley. Fjords are formed when a descending glacier carves a U-shaped valley into the bedrock. Often, the force of the descending glacier carving into the bedrock is so strong that fjords tend to be deeper than the oceans that they empty into. Fjords are statuesque and dazzling reminders of the glacial fingers that carved deep into the land, connecting mountains to sea where temperatures during the last great ice age were low enough to accommodate glaciers. They continue to amaze and enchant us, obvious from Norway's bustling fjord ecotourism industry.
