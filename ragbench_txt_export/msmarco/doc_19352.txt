The albumin blood test measures the amount of albumin in the blood serum. It can be used to evaluate how well the liver and kidneys are functioning. Low levels can indicate liver damage, while high levels indicate dehydration. The albumin blood test requires a blood sample drawn from a vein with a needle. Certain medications can increase the level of albumin in the blood, such as anabolic steroids, growth hormone, insulin and androgens.
