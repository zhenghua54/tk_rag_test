Added on Average price of a recent four day trip to Warsaw. Average price was 8-9 zloty per 500ml glass. Thanks. Added on Don't believe those prices-pint costs on average £1.50 but can be found in bars for £1.00. Added on In the more expensive bars it might cost you 1.50GBP but in most places it's under a pound. Cheap beer and the most fantastic women, what more could you want. Added on Chopins Bar
