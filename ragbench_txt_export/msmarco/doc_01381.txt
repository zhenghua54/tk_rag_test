Always use fresh lemons when making lemon curd. *** Use good quality butter. Do not use butter substitutes. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, and sugar. Bring just to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 5 minutes. Add butter and stir until it has melted. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
