The starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating the engine at a speed that allows the engine to start and maintain operation. Electrical power for starting is usually supplied by an on-board battery, but can also be supplied by external power through an external power receptacle. The fuel must be available to the engine under all conditions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and during all approved flight maneuvers. Two common classifications apply to fuel systems in small airplanes-gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems.
