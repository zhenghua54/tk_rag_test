Astaroth (アスタロット, also Astarot or Asutarotto) is one of the earliest characters introduced, initially appearing in Volume 2 of the first card series (7/18/2005). She is the reason most English speakers are aware of Shinra Bansho at all, thanks to her popularity in fan art, cosplay, and doujinshi over the years.
