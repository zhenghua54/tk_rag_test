Site Selection: Crape myrtles must be in full sun (at least 6 hours daily) to bloom to their maximum potential. Allow ample space for the mature height and spread of the selected crape myrtle variety: a few feet for miniatures and as much as 25 feet for the larger varieties such as Natchez or Muskogee.
