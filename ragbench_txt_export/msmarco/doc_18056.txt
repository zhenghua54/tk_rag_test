Answers. Best Answer: think of it this way you have a camera infront of a tv when it takes a picture of the screen its blank.. then the image of the screen will show inside the screen.. then it will take an image of the screen inside the screen then the image on the screen will have 2 images in the screen .. this will repeat over and over and over eventually filling the whole screen to a tiny dot with smaller and smaller images of the screen.. this mirror will now have THE IMAGE of the first mirror and its own image .. the light will then reflect back from that to the first one producing the image of the the second mirror with the image of the first mirror on it..
