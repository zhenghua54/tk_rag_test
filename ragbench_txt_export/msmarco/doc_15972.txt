The Messengers has performed quite poorly so far, even for a Friday night show. Last weekâ€™s installment hit a new low with just 650,000 viewers and a 0.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic. For now, it looks like the series will stay on the air to finish out its run of 13 total episodes. Well, The CW has done just that. The network has cancelled The Messengers after one season. Only three episodes have aired thus far. On The Messengers TV show, a mysterious object plummets to Earth and explodes in a blinding flash. It sends out a shock wave that instantly connects five strangers.
