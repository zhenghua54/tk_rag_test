An orb weaver includes any spider that makes an orb web, and orb webs are those round webs built on a radiating structure of spokes like a bicycle wheel, like the one in the photo above. Some orb webs can be very big and strong. Because their webs do such a brilliant job at catching and immobilising prey. Here are some of the more common orb-weaving spiders from the east coast of Australia. 1: St Andrewâ€™s Cross Spider with an especially large and clear cross pattern in the centre of its web. 2: The males are much smaller than the females.
