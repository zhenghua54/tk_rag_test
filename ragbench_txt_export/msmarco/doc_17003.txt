Sushi nutrition varies a lot from roll to roll, and in traditional vs. contemporary dishes. Yes, sushi may be small, put each little piece has the potential to pack a ton of calories depending on what you order. The Rainbow Roll is an uramaki sushi roll made with crab substitute, avocado, and a variety of raw fish toppings. It may be high in calories, but itâ€™s also really high in protein because of all the raw fish. Very high in carbs, so be warned.
