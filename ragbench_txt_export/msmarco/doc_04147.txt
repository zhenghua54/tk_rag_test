Freud terms this object-libido.. The libido can also get caught up in the ego, which leads to narcissism. A normal part of psychosexual development (see Module 1) is the overcoming of early childhood narcissism (the belief, for example, that everything revolves around one's own desires). The job of dream interpretation is to translate the manifest dream back into its constituent, if buried, dream-thoughts. The interpretation of symptomsfollows a similar path; the goal is to determine the repressed sexual desires or traumatic events that are causing the abnormal behavior to occur.
