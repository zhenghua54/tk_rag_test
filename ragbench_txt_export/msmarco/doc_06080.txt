Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common types of arthritis that occurs when cartilage in the joints begins to break down. Without that cushion, the bones rub against one another, causing symptoms like stiffness, joint pain, and loss of movement, especially in the knees, hips, and lower back. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis may be milder than other types of arthritis, affecting only a few joints, particularly those at the ends of the fingers and toes. But in some people, the arthritis may be more severe and cause stiffness, burning, and pain in the lower spine and sacrum.
