Green Lake County is home to one of the largest Amish settlements in Wisconsin, near the communities of Kingston and Dalton. The Kingston/Dalton settlement was founded in 1977 and has grown to 9 congregations today. Wisconsin is a state which saw Amish arrive relatively late compared to other states associated with the Plain People. Though the first Amish only began to settle in Wisconsin in the early 1900s, the Wisconsin Amish presence has grown to become the fourth-largest in North America.
