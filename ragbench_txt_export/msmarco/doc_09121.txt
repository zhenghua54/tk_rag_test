The first time HPV was discovered was back in 1956 by a group of scientists. It was in 1984, when Harald zur Hausen discovered, cloned, and attributed cervical cancer to HPV 16 and 18.Throug his research, he has contributed to the production of the vaccines [6]. HPV gets its name because certain strain causes warts, also known as papillomas [4]. The HPV test on the other hand checks for the virus itself and is used with the pap in women 30 and older, especially if the pap has unclear results. [1, 3, 4, 5] The HPV test, like the pap, takes a sample of cervical cells, which is then hybridized with a specific HPV RNA probe cocktail.
