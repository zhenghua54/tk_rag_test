1 Day. 3-5 Days. Of course, all foods last for a shorter period of time if they are not stored properly. But remember, watermelon, like a lot of other fresh fruits, usually does not have a use by date or a best before date so you will have to use the date purchased or date picked. Watermelon shelf can be extended by keeping it in the refrigerator, but be sure to keep it furthest from your freezer section or it may freeze. Watermelon does not freeze well, it becomes dark red and when you cut it open the juices just flow out... leaving a pretty empty rind!
