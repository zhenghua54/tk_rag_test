Posterior lymph nodes are located along the back of the neck. Deep cervical lymph nodes are associated with their positions adjacent to the internal jugular vein, which runs near the sides of the neck. They are known as the lateral jugular, anterior jugular, and jugulo-digastric lymph nodes. The inferior deep cervical lymph nodes, the juguloomohyoid nodes, and the supraclavicular, or scalene, nodes are considered deep jugular nodes. It is involved in protecting the body against infection, by delivering immune cells, known as lymphocytes, to areas where the immune response has been triggered. There are some 600 to 700 lymph nodes scattered throughout the body.
