Definition. The industrial sector of an economy that is dominated by the manufacture of finished products. Unlike a primary industry, which collects and produces raw materials for manufacture, a secondary industry makes products that are more likely to be consumed by individuals. Examples of secondary industry divisions include automobile manufacturing, steel production and telecommunications. My neighbor, Wilson, is a carpentar, this is a secondary industry that makes a whole bunch of people rich in the United States of America.
