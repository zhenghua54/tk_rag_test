Perhaps the most characteristic feature of life is the ability to replicate, to make copies of itself. During the process of cell division, the genetic material must be replicated. The two strands of the DNA molecule separate locally, and each serves as a template for generating a new strand. Changes in the DNA that accumulate prior to, or which occur during replication, are passed on to the daughter cells. These daughter cells are built using energy and matter captured from the environment.
