CT without contrast may be useful if MRI is not available or contraindicated. MRI with and without contrast may be indicated if noncontrast MRI is nondiagnostic or indeterminate. MRI is preferred over myelography and postmyelography CT, but may be indicated if MRI is nondiagnostic. In some circumstances (facet arthropathy, stress fracture and spondylolysis) NUC Tc-99m bone scan with SPECT may be useful.
