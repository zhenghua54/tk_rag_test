If your boil or carbuncle does not heal properly or if new symptoms develop, contact your provider. Boils may take from 1 to 3 weeks to heal. In most cases, a boil will not heal until it opens and drains. This can take up to a week. For treatment at home you can: 1  Wash your hands and then put a warm, moist cloth on the boil or carbuncle for 10 to 15 minutes at least 3 times a day. 2  This helps the boil come to a head and drain on its ownâ€”the safe way to drain. 3  Once the boil begins to drain, you will have less pressure and pain.
