Dear Eric: Just recently I ate a white fish called basa. It was very delicious and no bones. Americans say it comes from the polluted Mekong River, while the Australians say that the fish comes from fish farms near the Mekong River and is highly recommended. We need your advice. Al. Dear Al: With the name basa, one might think itâ€™s related to bass, a fish Canadians cast for in local rivers and lakes. Basa, also called swai and a few other names, is native to Southeast Asia. It is farmed in large numbers in pens around the Mekong River system of Vietnam, as well as in China and Cambodia.
