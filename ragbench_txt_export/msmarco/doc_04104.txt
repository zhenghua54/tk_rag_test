Research published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology shows that the more intense the lighting, the greater a person's emotions -- both positive and negative. Researchers noted that the bright light's ability to make people feel warmer could have something to do with increasing the intensity of their emotions. We suggest that these effects arise because light underlies perception of heat, and perception of heat can trigger the hot emotional system, the study said.
