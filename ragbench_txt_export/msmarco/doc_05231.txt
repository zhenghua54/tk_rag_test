A Pasi gong is a medium-size gong 12 to 15 in size, with a crashing sound. It is used traditionally to announce the start of a performance, play or magic. Construction varies, some having nipples and some not, so this type is named more for its function than for its structure or even its sound. Gong manufacturers [edit]. Besides many traditional and centuries old manufacturers in places such as China, Tibet, Burma, Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines, since the 20th Century gongs have also been made in Europe and America. Paiste is the largest non-Asian manufacturer of gongs.
