This unit will cover some basic recombinant DNA technologies, why they were developed, and how they are used today in many different scientific arenas. We will introduce the different types of restriction enzymes, their advantages and disadvantages, and how they are used to create a recombinant DNA molecule. We will review how to make a recombinant genomic DNA library and how to use this library to find a specific gene. You will determine which restriction enzyme to use to create a desired piece of recombinant DNA, given specific DNA sequences. You will also learn the function of DNA ligase, understand how vectors are used, and learn how to construct a recombinant genomic DNA library.
