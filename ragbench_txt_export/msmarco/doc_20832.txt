Vehicle Speed Sensors. Vehicle Speed Sensors come in several different designs depending on the manufacturer. Theyâ€™re used as sensor input for the ABS and Traction Control systems. It inputs data to the transmission for shift control, cruise control, and ABS (anti-lock brakes) only to name a few. As the shaft of this sensor spins, it generates an on off signal to the vehicles PCM and TCM. The PCM converts this signal into vehicle speed. In later model vehicles this information is shared between computer systems by multiplexing.
