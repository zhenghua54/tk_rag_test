Place a dehumidifier in your house, especially in damp and humid areas such as your basement. Choose a dehumidifier that has automated controls for monitoring and setting relative humidity levels; the ideal humidity level for a home is 40 percent to 50 percent in the summer and 30 percent to 50 percent in the winter.
