A subsidy is financial assistance that helps you pay for something. It's not a loan; you don't pay it back. There are two kinds of subsidies available from the federal government for individual health insurance plans. 1  The Advanced Premium Tax Credit lowers your monthly health insurance payment, or premium. If you're an individual who makes about $29,000 or less, or a family of four that makes about $59,000 or less, you may qualify for both subsidies. If you get a subsidy, you'll have to report it when you send in your taxes. When it's time to file your taxes, you'll get a 1095 form with all the necessary information.
