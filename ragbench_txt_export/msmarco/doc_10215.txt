Young kittens will need a vet visit on a monthly basis until they reach around 4 months of age to get their necessary vaccinations and to check for illnesses. They will need to return as they approach 6 months for their spaying or neutering procedure. Cats need to see the vet at least once a year because they need their vaccinations. While indoor cats don't need as many vaccinations as those that live primarily or partially outside, they need what are considered core vaccines necessary for all cats, according to WebMD.
