The Amazon River does flood and it usually starts in November. The  river floods every year and can swell up to 25 miles and tripling  the land area it cover. The estuary where it meets the ocean is over 200 miles across and deep enough for sea-going vessels to travel nearly 2/3 of the way up the river. Approximately 20% of all of the freshwater in the world that enters the ocean is by way of the Amazon river.
