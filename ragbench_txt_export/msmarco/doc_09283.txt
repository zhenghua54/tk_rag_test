If your home is on the low side of 68 to 72ºF, your seeds will benefit from bottom heat. As a general rule, seeds will germinate indoors where the soil temperature is held constant. In nature, the soil temperature is usually lower at night. Therefore, an indoor drop in temperature at night of less than 10ºF will not significantly delay seedling emergence. The effect of soil temperature on sown seeds. The chart below displays the relationship between soil temperature, days to emergence, and the percentage of sown seeds to germinate: As you might expect, the percentage of any seeds to germinate is maximum at the optimal temperature for that species.
