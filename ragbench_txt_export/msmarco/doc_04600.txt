Best Answer: If you were not having any difficulty in breathing, they normally do not x-ray for broken ribs. If you would have had difficulty, the x-ray would be used to see if the fractured rib, punchered a lung..... As for how long will it take..... the pain should start subsiding after the 1st week..... provided you do not over stretch, hit it against anything, etc
