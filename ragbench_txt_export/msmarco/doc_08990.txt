Perioral dermatitis is a common skin rash that mainly affects young women. The rash affects the skin around the mouth. Use of a steroid cream on the face seems to trigger the condition in many cases. Treatment includes stopping the use of all creams and ointments to the face, including cosmetics and topical steroids.
