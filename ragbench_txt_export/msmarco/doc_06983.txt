Working and SSDI Benefits. Generally, you can't start doing substantial gainful activity (SGA) and continue to receive disability benefits. In a nutshell, SGA means you are working and making more than $1,090 per month (or $1,820 if you're blind). There are exceptions to this rule, however. For SSDI recipients, there is a trial work period during which you can make more than the SGA amount without losing your benefits.
