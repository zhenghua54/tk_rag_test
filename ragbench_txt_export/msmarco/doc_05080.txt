1. Decide on the square footage of the room you will be adding to your home. Room additions can cost up to 50 percent higher, between $80 and $130 per square foot before considering wiring and plumbing, than that same room had been constructed with the rest of the house, according to the Home Addition Plus website. 5. Make sure to address other costs associated with the addition of the new room when calculating its overall cost. Youâ€™ll generally have to pay a disposal service for cleanup and removal of old or excess materials.
