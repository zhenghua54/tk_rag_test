Liz Smith started acting at around the age of 50 (in the 1970s) and it's only in the last ten years that she's found national success and acknowledgement. Goes to show that persistence pays off. Hope this helps. Which successful actors started acting late? Ok, so like...Robert Pattinson-kinda late, 15, in plays. It's not actually late, but if you look at all the other actors-seems late.
