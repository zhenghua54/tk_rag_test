Updated for Tax Year 2014. OVERVIEW. You can calculate what you owe in back taxes fairly accurately without even contacting the IRS. Finding out how much you owe the IRS in back taxes will depend on whether the tax relates to returns youâ€™ve already filed or ones you still need to file. Step 2: File your past-due tax returns. If your back taxes relate to returns you have yet to file, then you can calculate the amount of tax you owe for each year by preparing the actual return. However, when you do, you must use all tax forms for the year you are filing.
