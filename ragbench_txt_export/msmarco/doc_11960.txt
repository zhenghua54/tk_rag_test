A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by human, a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. A place where a living thing lives is its habitat. It is a place where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. A habitat is not necessarily a geographic areaâ€”for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a cell within the host's body.
