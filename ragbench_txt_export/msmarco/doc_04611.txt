While human infections are possible, infection with avian influenza viruses in general are rare and – when they occur – these viruses have not spread easily to other people. These reports of H5-infected wild birds and poultry in the United States do not signal the start of a pandemic. In the current response effort, USDA is coordinating closely with State officials (in affected and bordering States) and other Federal departments on avian influenza surveillance, reporting and control efforts. USDA also is coordinating with Canada on the HPAI H5 findings that are close to the Northern U.S. border.
