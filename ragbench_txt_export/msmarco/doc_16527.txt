E ea generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a Group 17 atom releases more energy than a Group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and therefore is more stable. A trend of decreasing E ea going down the groups in the periodic table might be expected.
