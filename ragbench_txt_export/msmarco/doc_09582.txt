GraphPad Prism 6.0. GraphPad Prism was originally designed for experimental biologists in medical schools and drug companies, especially those in pharmacology and physiology. Prism is now used much more broadly by all kinds of biologists, as well as social and physical scientists. The main difference is that the Mac version does not support Object Linking and Embedding (OLE): When you copy and paste a graph created with Prism Windows into another program such as Word or PowerPoint, you can embed an entire Prism object or paste a link to the Prism file.
