Leukopenia is a shortage of white blood cells in the system, which can be caused by anemia, menorrhagia, etc. A low white blood cell count, or leukopenia will have a direct effect on your body's immune system. White blood cells are used to fight off infections within the blood stream. Without an adequate number of white blood cells your body will have trouble ridding itself of bacteria or viral matter which can cause disease.ny disease or condition that disrupts the production or function of bone marrow will cause the body to develop leukopenia. Viral infections will often cause the body to slow bone marrow function. Viral infections can also lower the white blood cell count as the cells die off fighting the infection.
