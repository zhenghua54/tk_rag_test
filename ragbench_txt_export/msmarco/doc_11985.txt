The rules for determining the penalties for withdrawing money early from a Roth IRA account are pretty easy to understand. You are allowed to withdraw money from your Roth IRA account once you reach age 59 1/2. If you withdraw funds from the account before you reach that age, you will be assessed the penalty.
