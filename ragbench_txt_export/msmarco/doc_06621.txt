Polyamide. A polyamide fibre is defined by BISFA as being a fibre composed of linear macromolecules having in the chain recurring amide linkages, at least 85% of which are joined to aliphatic or cycloaliphatic units. There are many polyamide fibres made but only two, described below, are made in significant quantities. To produce fibres from the polyamide polymers the molten polymer is pumped through spinneret holes at a temperature approaching 300 degrees C to form filaments that are cooled and solidified in a quench air stream.
