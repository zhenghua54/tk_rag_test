1 Apply your favorite rub and refrigerate overnight. 2  Cook the brisket fat-side down at 325-375°F for 2 to 2-1/2 hours to an internal temperature of 170°F. 3  Wrap in foil fat-side up and cook another 2 to 2-1/2 hours until fork tender. This should keep the meat at a food-safe temperature of 140°F or higher for 2-3 hours. When ready to serve, position the brisket fat-side up (Photo 11) and separate the point section from the flat section along the fat seam. In Photo 12, the point is on the left, the flat is on the right.
