Mark 4 Tactical Mounts. Mark 4 tactical bases and rings are the strongest of all Leupold mounting systems. The one-piece base features a built-in 15 MOA slope for long range shooting. Both 6-48 shoulder screws and the larger 8-40 screws are included to accommodate high recoil applications. The Leupold steel standard bases and rings are the most versatile of any mounting system we offer. The rear ring is secured by windage adjustment screws, allowing the scopeâ€™s internal adjustments to be reserved for precise sight-in.
