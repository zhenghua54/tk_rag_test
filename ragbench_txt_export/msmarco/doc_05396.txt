Well the average IQ of a person is 100 (by definition of IQ) But I am only 11 and mine is 131, so hopefully it would be higher than that for an adult! You need to rephrase the question to get a meaningful answer. The average IQ is 100 and only a small percent have exactly that IQ. Most, however, are within the range of 8 â€¦ 5-100.
