The term labor and delivery (L&D) nurse does not adequately describe the wide scope of this branch of the nursing profession. L&D nurses must be quick thinkers, good communicators, and rapid assessors to treat unpredictable shifts in the health of mom and baby with compassion and safety. Training. LPNs and RNs learn L&D on the job. Most degree programs have a class and/or clinical experiences in maternal and child health, but nursing students cannot choose a specialty as undergraduates and may only get a brief look into the field before they move to another area of study.
