A sudden change in humidity can cause splitting in both newly installed and older hardwood floors. The boards canâ€™t withstand the stress of the rapid expansion or contraction, and they split. The only repair for this type of splitting is to remove the source of humidity and to replace the damaged boards. Wood is a porous material, and while wood flooring is sealed with a protective coating, the surface beneath it is not. As a result, the wood naturally expands and contracts with humidity and other moisture. Splits are most commonly caused by this natural movement. Although it is impossible to provide the ideal conditions to prevent cracking entirely, there are some factors that can be eliminated to minimize splitting in your wood floor
