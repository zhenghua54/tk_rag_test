The Continental was impressive in the wet-braking test and has a good balance of all-weather performance and tread life. Another Continental PureContact model led the performance all-season V-speed-rated group, followed closely by the Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season. The Continental is an all-around good performer. In the performance all-season H-speed-rated category, the Michelin Primacy MXV4 was its top-rated model with the Continental PureContact close behind. The Michelin performed well in most weather tests, offers a comfortable, quiet ride and has low rolling resistance.
