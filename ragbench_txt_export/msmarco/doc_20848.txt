Introduction. Ratified on August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted American women the right to voteâ€”a right known as woman suffrage. At the time the U.S. was founded, its female citizens did not share all of the same rights as men, including the right to vote. On November 2 of that same year, more than 8 million women across the U.S. voted in elections for the first time. It took over 60 years for the remaining 12 states to ratify the 19th Amendment.
