Produced within the bodies of animals (including humans), collagen is a collection of proteins. It’s present in the skin, but it’s also required to make and maintain healthy connective tissue throughout the body. Of course, what we’re really interested in here is what collagen does to maintain the skin’s integrity. Along with keratin, a protein most often associated with hair and skin, and elastin, collagen maintains elasticity and strength. It also “plumps out” the skin, making lines appear more shallow.
