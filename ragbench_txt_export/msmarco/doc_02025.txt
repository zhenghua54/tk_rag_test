A traffic or nontraffic misdemeanor case begins when a law enforcement officer issues a Uniform Law Citation (ticket) claiming you have violated a state law or a local ordinance (local law) when the penalty for that offense includes a jail sentence for 93 days or less. If convicted of a misdemeanor, you may be sentenced to jail. If you are 17 years of age or older and are convicted of a traffic misdemeanor, you may be required to pay a fine and costs. Points will be added to your driving record by the Secretary of State, and some convictions may result in jail sentences.
