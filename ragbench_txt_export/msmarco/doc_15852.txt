an organic compound is a compound which must contain hydrogen and carbon but carbon dioxide consists of carbon only so it is considered as a inorganic compound. These compounds of carbon are just assumed to be inorganic. Also there is that one thing about carbon being covalently bonded with hydrogen in organic compounds. Due to that criteria carbon dioxide is considered inorganic. But actually there is no clear reason.
