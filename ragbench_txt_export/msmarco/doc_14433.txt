The results of the ENCODE project are presented in 30 papers, published simultaneously in Nature, Genome Research and Genome Biology, and collected here. The latest chapter in our story is ENCODE; an ambitious project which aims to characterise all the functional element in the human genome. This animation shows how ENCODE is the next major step along this path.
