You may need to have another ultrasound a week or so later to detect the pregnancy, if you still feel you are pregnant and/or your blood HCG levels are rising. Generally, blood tests tend to be more relied upon up to 8 weeks of the pregnancy, with ultrasounds being more useful after this time. A tiny sac can be seen, but the baby and their heart beat may not be detected yet. Be aware that while it is possible to see a pregnancy this small, in many cases the pregnancy may not be detected, because the sac is so tiny.
