Radioactive accessory minerals such as zircon may contribute to the radioactivity of a mineral which is otherwise non-radioactive by calculation. Many granites or other igneous rocks contain some radioactivity because of minor, but highly radioactive, accessory minerals. re = mineral density (S Atomic number / Molecular Weight) where re is the electron density in grams/cc. Definition. Radioactivity in minerals are caused by the inclusion of naturally-occurring radioactive elements in the mineral's composition. The degree of radioactivity is dependent on the concentration and isotope present in the mineral. For the most part, minerals that contain potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th) are radioactive. This table lists all of the naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes. Mineral radioactivity is due to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation from the unstable isotopes in the composition
