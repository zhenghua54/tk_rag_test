Wisteria (Wisteria spp.) plants are a group of climbing, woody vines or shrubs that produce large white, blue or violet flowers. Wisteria are grown as climbing vines in many home landscapes, but they can also be trained into tree form. Wisteria seeds contain wisterin, which is a glycoside and a toxic resin. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. 1  Dig This.
