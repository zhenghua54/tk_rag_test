1. Make sure the battery is completely exhausted. Let your electronic device turn off by itself once the battery is dead. It is important to start the process from this position because what you are really doing here is calibrating your device to know how much juice is in the battery. 2. Plug your device in and let it charge until it signifies you have charged it completely. Four bars on a cell phone, full battery on a laptop, whatever it may say, it is probably wrong-and you should be able to tell because the device will not hold a charge for as long as you would like.
