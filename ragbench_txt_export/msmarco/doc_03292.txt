Peripheral Artery Disease. Peripheral artery disease affects the arteries that supply the arms and legs with oxygen-rich blood. Symptoms may include: 1  Pain, aching, cramps, numbness, or sense of fatigue in the leg muscles (intermittent claudication). Fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances form plaque, which builds up in arteries. Hard plaque narrows the passage that blood flows through. That causes arteries to become stiff and inflexible (atherosclerosis is also known as hardening of the arteries).
