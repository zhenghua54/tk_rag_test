Beef cattle do not have the same need for protein as dairy cows do, and can be maintained on grass hay. Grass-fed cattle grow more slowly than grain-fed cattle, and are often marketed when 2-4 years old. Grain supplements can increase the growth rate, allowing cattle to be marketed earlier. Nevertheless, organic beef producers focus on forage and use grain sparingly.
