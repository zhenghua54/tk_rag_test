Clicking on the menu choice Explanation results in the appearance of a small white box that explains the plural formation process for the particular singular/plural word selected. In the case of bacillus/bacilli, the explanation is that some singular nouns from Latin ending in us form the plural by changing the us to i. Clicking on the menu choice Definition results in the same white box, this time with the dictionary definition of the (Irregular or Double Plural) noun that has been selected. Once the student clicks on OK, the computer program gets to work and analyzes the noun jibberbob. First it checks to see if this is one of the Irregular or Double Plural nouns it knows; since these are irregular, the computer of course has a list and can make a match with the Irregular or Double Plural plural form.
