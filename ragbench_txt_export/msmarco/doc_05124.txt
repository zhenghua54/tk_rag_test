When you sell a call option, you are obligated to sell the stock you already own at the strike price if the buyer exercises the call option. You own 100 shares of ABC stock valued at $45. In the short term (less than 30 days) you expect the stock price to rise slightly to a maximum value of $48. You sell a $50 call option on ABC stock that expires in 30 days, which earns you an option premium valued at $100 (1.00 option premium x 100 shares = $100). This means that the buyer of the call option has the right to purchase the stock at a $50 strike price before the 30-day expiration date.
