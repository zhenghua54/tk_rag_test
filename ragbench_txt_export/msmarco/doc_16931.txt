The name’s meaning in French – ‘de Burgo’ or ‘de Burgh’, signifying “of the borough” – and in the Middle English translation – ‘burk’, meaning ‘fort’ – are locational/geographic in origin. The surname Burke has also inspired a sinister verb: ‘burking’. It comes from the Irish criminal William Burke (1792–1829) who migrated to Scotland and committed a gruesome series of murders in Edinburgh.
