The peak period of Italian immigration coincided with a period of immense poverty in much of Southern Italy. Prior to the 1890s, most immigrants came from northern Italy, but from then on, immigration rates were particularly high from Italy’s poor southern half. More than 17 million Americans claim Italian descent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making Italians the United States’ fourth largest ethnic group after German, Irish and English. Most of these Americans are descendants of past migrants from Italy.
