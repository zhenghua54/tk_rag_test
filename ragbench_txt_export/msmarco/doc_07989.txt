Serge is a specific weave, a 2x2 even-faced twill usually in a worsted wool. It can be made in a variety of weights. I have a serge suit from Polo that is perfect for 9-month use. Serge is indeed perfect for a blazer, and IMO the only choice for a double-breasted blazer. Single-breasted blazers are also great in hopsack.
