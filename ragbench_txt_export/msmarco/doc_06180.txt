In this review, we present evidence that glyceroneogenesis is the primary pathway for triglyceride synthesis in adipose tissue and liver, and that the regulation of glyceroneogenesis by hormones and diet is a key element in controlling lipid metabolism in mammals. The synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue and muscle is a crucial element of energy metabolism because it ensures that adequate fuel is available during starvation.
