The recipe is included in my cookbook Mint, Cinnamon & Blossom Water, Flavours of Cyprus, Kopiaste as well as in Volume 2 of my e-cookbook. Kopiaste and Kali Orexi, Tags: Breads, Cheese, Cypriot, Cypriot cookbook, dough, flaounes, Greek cheese, Kopiaste.. Flavours of Cyprus, made with phyllo, pies, Traditional. I tend to use a mix of greek cheeses, along with Halloumi, Anari and 50-60% mild english cheddar. Itâ€™s very difficult for me to sit here and convince people to sub some greek cheese for english cheddar because Flaounes are really hard to make.
