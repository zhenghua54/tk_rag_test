Simple carbohydrates, like refined sugar, white bread and soda, cause your insulin levels to spike, which leads to what Dr. Perricone describes as a burst of inflammation throughout the body.. Inflammation produces enzymes that break down collagen and elastin, resulting in sagging skin and wrinkles. Exfoliation is an important and easy way to buff away the dead skin cells that cover up your skin's natural glow. Use a light exfoliator, like the Daily Microfoliant from Dermalogica, to freshen your face daily. When choosing a foundation, test a product on the skin near your jawline.
