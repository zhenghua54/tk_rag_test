The electromagnetic spectrum is a map of all the types of light that we can identify. It separates all the types of light by wavelength because that directly relates to how energetic the wave is. More energetic waves have shorter wavelengths while less energetic waves have longer wavelengths. Not all light is in the visible spectrum, which is the light you can see. There are many kinds of electromagnetic waves that you can't see. Just look at the spectrum below. When we talk about a light detector, we are referring to any instrument that detects electromagnetic radiation.
