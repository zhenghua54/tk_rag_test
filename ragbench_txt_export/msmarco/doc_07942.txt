Taste of Midori. Midori is a melon flavored liqueur; it originated in Japan (my bottle was made by Suntory, though). It is a very visually appealing liqueur, with a vivid green color. I think thatâ€™s honestly the major reason it is used in a lot of cocktails, because it makes for some beautiful drinks.
