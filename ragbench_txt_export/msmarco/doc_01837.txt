Zebras seek balance in what they do, and they are sure of themselves, standing confidently in the middle of opposing forces. Those with this power animal are taught similar skills. When the zebra comes into your life, change is signified in one or more areas of your life and hidden knowledge will be uncovered. The zebra’s black and white stripes camouflage it against predators, who often cant identify individuals in the herd. However to the herd members the patterns are unique from zebra to zebra, helping to identify one another – they are as unique as our fingerprints.
