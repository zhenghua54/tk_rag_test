Because of the prevalence of learning issues and other developmental problems among children with epilepsy, experts now acknowledge the importance of treating the whole child, rather than simply treating the child's seizures. Even when seizures are well controlled, epilepsy may present a host of other issues that can impact a child's development and ability to function normally. Cognitive impairments that affect language, memory, attention, and other abilities critical to normal development are common among people with epilepsy.
