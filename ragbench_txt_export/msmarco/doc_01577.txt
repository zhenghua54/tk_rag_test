1 All cells in a higher eukaryote (like us) are diploid ­ EXCEPT ...for the germ cells ­ eggs and sperm. 2  Germ cells have only half the number of chromosomes as a diploid cell ­ one of each pair-and are termed haploid (n) . 3  In a human egg or sperm, there are 23 chromosomes, one of which is an X or Y. Summary: At the end of meiosis, 4 daughter cells are formed = eggs or sperm. Each contains half as many chromosomes as the parent cell (n); each cell is genetically different from its parents and from its siblings. Fertilization of an egg by a sperm restores the chromosome number to 2n.
