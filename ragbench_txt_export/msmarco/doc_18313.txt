While most of the retail building supply companies sell Schedule 40 PVC, they usually do not carry Schedule 80. You will need to locate an electrical supply house to purchase Schedule 80. Code also requires that no low-voltage wires be placed in conduit with 120/240-volt circuits. On the other hand, if you use conduit, the trench needs to be only 18 inches below the surface. Another advantage is that the conduit can carry several wires â€“ wires to control garage lights from switches inside the house, as well as the power supply wires. Not all types of conduit can be buried in the soil.
