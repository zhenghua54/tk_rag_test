Make no mistake, the use of unmarked cars for patrol in Washington is ILLEGAL, whether done by the State Patrol or a city or county department, and any ticket issued from one is invalid. City and county cars are required to have lettering or a logo on the sides. In the case of the State Patrol, they rely on the exemption in the law for traffic control vehicles.. In short, traffic control vehicles have yellow lights and are for CONTROLLING traffic in work or accident zones.
