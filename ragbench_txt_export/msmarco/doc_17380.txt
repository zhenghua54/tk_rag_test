Should you apply as soon as you are eligible and take reduced benefits for life, or wait until your full retirement age and get a bigger check each month? Or maybe you should delay your benefits for a few years after full retirement age —up to age 70—to ensure an even bigger Social Security check. By contrast, if you elect to receive Social Security benefits early, say at age 62, then you get a reduced monthly benefit for more years.
