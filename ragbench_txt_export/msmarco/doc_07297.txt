On vehicles with disc brakes on the front and drum brakes on the rear, you can expect to replace the front pads twice before you need to replace the rear brake shoes. That is because when you brake the vehicleâ€™s weight shifts to the front, so that the front brakes have to work harder. Also, brake wear depends in part on how much weight the brakes are trying to stop; a heavily loaded van or truck, or a passenger car with 6 adults, will take longer to stop and result in heavier brake wear, than an empty or lightly loaded vehicle.
