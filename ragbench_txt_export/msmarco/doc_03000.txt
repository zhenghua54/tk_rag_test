Like many of our favorite stones Morganite is a variety of Beryl, and an excellent choice for both gemstone jewelry and for metaphysical purposes. Like Green Emerald stones this stone carries the vibration of love, and not just love for other people. Sometimes dark Pink stones of Morganite are labeled Bixbite to get peoples attention, but real Bixbite is a little rare, and a deeper pink or red in color. The color of lighter pink Morganite stones may be intensified by heat, but they may also turn an orange color from the heat.
