Hyperuricemia, an abnormally high level of uric acid in your body, can cause a type of kidney stone and exacerbate gout if excess uric acid forms painful crystals in joints. Researchers found that the association between high blood pressure and high uric acid in the blood was more evident in people with the highest HDL -- or good -- cholesterol levels. This led them to conclude that HDL cholesterol might modify uric acid in the blood, but more research is needed.
