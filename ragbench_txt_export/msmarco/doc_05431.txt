1 Installation of a 4'-6' tall chain-link fence with privacy slats or a built-in fabric screen can cost $6-$40 a foot ($600-$4,000 for 100' and $1,800-$12,000 for 300') depending on the type of materials, whether installation in included, and the height, gauge and mesh of the fence. Made with wood, with vinyl or screened chain link, a privacy fence is typically 4'-6' tall and solid, designed to block an area from view. Although it's possible to enclose an entire yard with a privacy fence, because of cost it can be more practical to screen a smaller area, like a patio, pool or hot tub.
