A chef’s jacket is a great way to solve this problem; you can simply hang it on a hook in your kitchen and put it on whenever you’re ready to start cooking. While long sleeves are important, it’s also important to make sure that your sleeves are not so loose fitting that they hang by the flame when you’re at the stove. If you have an apron, a towel is the first thing you should put in one of the pockets. Whether or not you need one or all of these items in your kitchen is dependent on your skill level and the amount of time you spend in the kitchen.
