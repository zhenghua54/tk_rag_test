Ground Information. The home of Saracens since 2013 has been Allianz Park, located in the North London suburb of Hendon. Traditionally an athletics stadium (known as Barnet Copthall), the ground has been completed redeveloped and controversially features an artificial pitch that has been specially developed for rugby. Today the club is home to a significant number of South African-born players amongst a number of other nationalities. In 2006, Saracens moved home ground (something of a trend over the years!) to Vicarage Road, the home of Watford Football Club where the club remained until 2013.
