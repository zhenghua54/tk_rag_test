A recurring prostate infection, also known as chronic bacterial prostatitis, is typically treated with antibiotics. This type of prostate infection is caused by bacteria in the prostate gland. A prostate infection might recur because antibiotics aren't able to get deep enough into the prostate tissue to destroy all of the bacteria or because the antibiotic isn't effective against the type of bacterium causing the prostate infection.
