Levels 1 to 15. This, sad to say, is one of the worst times to make money through Woodcutting. All you will need to do, is gather around 1,000 normal logs with the best place to buy them is in Draynor Village. Then sell them on the Runescape Forums (You have to be a member to post on there, but not to view it). You can try to sell them either on the Grand Exchange, or in the RuneScape forums. However, it is usually hard to sell them in the RuneScape forums, so the Grand Exchange is recommended. Another alternative is using the High Alchemy spell on the Longbows. You will get 768 coins for each alchemy spell.
