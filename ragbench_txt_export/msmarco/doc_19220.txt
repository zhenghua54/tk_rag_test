Carbohydrates are made up of glucose subunits. In complex carbohydrates long polymer chains of glucose subunits form the higher structure, they can be nibbled from either e â€¦ nd by digestion enzymes. The breakdown into glucose is needed for metabolism. Sugar units are called saccharides in chemistry. Starch and cellulose are polysaccharides made from glucose.
