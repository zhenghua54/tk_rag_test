It seems like once a year or so I get around to doing a blog post on cold sores, so here's one for 2012. Specifically, today I want to talk about treating a cold sore, and whether it is better to let it dry out, or to keep it moist. This topic came up the other day when I was talking to a patient about cold sores. He told me about his two grandmothers and their conflicting views on treating everything, cold sores included.
