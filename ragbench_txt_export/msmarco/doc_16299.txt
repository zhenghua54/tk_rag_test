For the thermal insulation material sometimes called fiberglass, see glass wool. For the glass fiber itself, also sometimes called fiberglass, see glass fiber. For similar composite materials in which the reinforcement fiber is carbon fibers, see carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The glass fiber may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a chopped strand mat), or woven into a fabric. The plastic matrix may be a thermosetting plastic – most often epoxy, polyester resin – or vinylester, or a thermoplastic.
