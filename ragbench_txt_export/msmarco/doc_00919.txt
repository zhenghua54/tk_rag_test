DNA fingerprinting is a test to identify and evaluate the genetic information—called DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)—in a person's cells. DNA samples can: 1  Determine who a person's parents are (establish paternity and maternity). 2  Determine whether a suspect was present at a crime scene, by comparing DNA from the scene to the DNA of the suspect. 3  Positively identify a body. DNA fingerprinting is done to: 1  Find out who a person's parents or siblings are. 2  This test also may be used to identify the parents of babies who were switched at birth. 3  Solve crimes (forensic science).
