Sequential measurements of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in patients with iron deficiency anemia provide a rapid means for assessing the erythropoietic response to iron replacement therapy (Brugnara et al., Blood 1994;83:3100-3101). The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr or Ret-He) provides an indirect measure of the functional iron available for new red blood cell production over the previous 3-4 days.
