Sponsorship Basics. When advertising agencies and media refer to sponsors, they are typically talking about the company or organization that pays to buy media space. Thus, the general use of sponsorship is in reference to the paid sponsor of an advertising message delivery. Corporate or event sponsorship is a more specific form of advertising. US Legal actually uses the phrase a form of advertising in its definition of corporate sponsorship. Companies sometimes sponsor charitable events or community activities to build their image as a socially responsible company.
