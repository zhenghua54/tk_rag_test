Razor Bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae, pronounced soo-doe-fol-li-cu-li'-tis): Razor bumps are created when the growing beard hairs exit the skin, curl over, and burrow into the adjacent skin, resulting in an unsightly bump. No other product in the world can do all that Tend SkinÂ® Liquid does, especially when it comes to ingrown hairs and razor bumps (Pseudofolliculitis barbae, PFB).
