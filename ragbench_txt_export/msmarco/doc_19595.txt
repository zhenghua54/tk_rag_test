The terms for this movement Renaissance (rinascimento rebirth) and humanist (whence modern humanism; also Renaissance humanism to distinguish it from later developments grouped as humanism) are contemporary to that period. Two noteworthy trends in Renaissance humanism were Renaissance Neo-Platonism and Hermeticism, which through the works of figures like Nicholas of Kues, Giordano Bruno, Cornelius Agrippa, Campanella and Pico della Mirandola sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself.
