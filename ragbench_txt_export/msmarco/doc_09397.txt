Four Forces Affect Things That Fly: 1  Weight is the force of gravity. 2  Lift is the force that acts at a right angle to the direction of motion through the air. 3  Thrust is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction of motion. 4  Drag is the force that acts opposite to the direction of motion. 1 Lift is created by differences in air pressure. 2  Thrust is the force that propels a flying machine in the direction of motion. 3  Engines produce thrust
