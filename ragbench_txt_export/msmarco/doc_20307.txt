Homes can be built out of lots of different things â€“ different types of rocks such as sandstone or granite or bricks made from clay. Cement used to hold bricks together is made using limestone, clay, shale and gypsum. Aggregates are used to make roads and concrete. They come from quarries, river beds or the sea floor.
