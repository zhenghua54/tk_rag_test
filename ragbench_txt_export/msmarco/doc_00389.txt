I have been researching my family tree and many others since I was a teenager! The surname Henderson is a Scottish and northern Irish patronymic from Hendry, a Scottish spelling of the personal name Henry. Some Scottish families with this name have ancestors whose name was Henryson. Paulsen derives from the first name Paul. Another origin but least likely than the first is Paulsell being a variant of English surname Parsell, also as Parsells, and Purcell. See related links below for more information.
