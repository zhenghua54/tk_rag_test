Weight Loss Basics. You ate 3,500 calories more than you burned to gain every excess pound, and you'll need to eat 3,500 calories fewer than you burn to take them off. Fortunately, the foods you've chosen -- fruits, vegetables and lean proteins -- generally contain fewer calories than high-fat meats and snack foods. Still, you'll need to count calories and consume fewer of them. To lose 4 to 5 lbs. in one month, you should consume about 500 to 600 fewer calories each day than you would if you weren't trying to lose weight.
