Lettuce, tomatoes, feta, and olives are the most standard elements in an American-style Greek salad, but cucumbers, peperoncini (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, radishes, dolmades, and anchovies/ sardines are common. Common additions include green bell pepper slices or berries of capers (especially in the Dodecanese islands). The term Greek salad can also be used in North America, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom to refer to a lettuce salad with Greek-inspired ingredients, dressed with oil and vinegar.
