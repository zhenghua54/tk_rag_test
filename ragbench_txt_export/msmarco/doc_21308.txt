You can multiply the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by any nonzero whole number, as long as you multiply both by the same whole number! For example, you can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3, as shown in part A above. But you cannot multiply the numerator by 3 and the denominator by 5. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same nonzero whole number will change that fraction into an equivalent fraction, but it will not change its value. Equivalent fractions may look different, but they have the same value. Let's look at some more examples of equivalent fractions. Example 5.
