When most people buy a home, they generally obtain a mortgage. Mortgages have costs and one of those costs is the loan origination fee.. The loan origination fee is usually a percentage of the loan amount, generally expressed as points.. For example, one point on a $150,000 loan would be $1500. One and a half points on the same loan amount would be $2250. On VA and FHA loans, points are often broken down into two categories: loan origination fee (which is usually one point) and discount points (which are also a percentage of the loan balance). Both are deductible.
