Astaroth is the primary antagonist of the Tapestry. He appears to be an ancient demon/deity whose goal is to seek out the Book of Thoth and use it to re-shape the world. David Menlo suspects that what he craves is not power but approval. Astaroth is an ancient being of prodigious magical might, and is easily one of the series' most powerful characters. Shapechanging: Astaroth may alter his shape at will into any form he desires. Devour: Astaroth can consume other magical beings to gain their power, as he did with Elias Bram.
