Splits in hardwood flooring are often caused by excessive or rapid drying. If the moisture content is reduced to less than 4 percent, the grain separates, causing splits. Minor cracks are common as a floor ages. As moisture is absorbed back into the wood, the grain expands again, and the cracks may disappear. Wood is a porous material, and while wood flooring is sealed with a protective coating, the surface beneath it is not. As a result, the wood naturally expands and contracts with humidity and other moisture. Splits are most commonly caused by this natural movement. Although it is impossible to provide the ideal conditions to prevent cracking entirely, there are some factors that can be eliminated to minimize splitting in your wood floo
