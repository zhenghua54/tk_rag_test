Rollboard. Rollboard, also known as millboard, is a type of insulation used from the mid-to-late 20th century in home and building construction where flame or heat was likely to be a hazard. Rollboard is widely used in construction to make walls and ceilings flame resistant. Some rollboard products have been known to be comprised of as much as 85 percent asbestos. In addition to walls and ceilings, asbestos rollboard was used around stoves and furnaces.
