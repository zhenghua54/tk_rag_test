Chipotle is in the business (like Apple) of giving you what you need and not always what you want. By focusing on only serving food free of added hormones, without additives, without preservatives, etc… Chipotle has created a foodie movement that is long overdue. Chipotle Mexican Grill is famous for focusing on “Food With Integrity” and its menu is as short and simple as the company mission to change the way people think and eat fast food.
