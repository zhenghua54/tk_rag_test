Around the time of a mised period the hCG level and hCG numbers range between 50 mIU/ml and 80 mIU/ml. By this point, the normal miscarriage rate is down to 10% since the baby is clearly well implanted and churning out proper hormones. The rate of hCG numbers in early pregnancy should usually double every 2-3 days. hCG pregnancy hormone information on hCG numbers in early pregnancy and all the facts are presented here. Urine tests measure the urine HCG numbers in early pregnancy qualitatively, which means that the HPT results are either positive or negative while blood HCG numbers in pregnancy give a specific number in mIU/ml.
