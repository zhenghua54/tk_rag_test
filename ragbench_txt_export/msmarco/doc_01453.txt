Running cost = Consumption of Heater X number of hours run X Electricity Unit Cost. So let work out how much it will cost to run a 2000 watt (2kw) convector heater for a period of 5 hours where each unit of electricity costs us 13 pence. 2 (kw) x 5 (hours) x 13 (pence) = 130 pence or £1.30. So to run a 2kw convector for 5 hours would cost you £1.30 based on an Electricity unit cost of 13 pence. Lets do the formula again, but this time using the rating of a 2500 watt convector heater, and an Electricity unit cost of 17p in the example. 2.5 (kw) x 5 (hours) x 17 (pence) = 212.5 Pence or £2.125.
