The main difference between subsidized loans and unsubsidized loans is that the federal government pays the interest on subsidized loans during periods of authorized deferment, such as the in-school and economic hardship deferments, while the interest remains the responsibility of the borrower on an unsubsidized loan. With unsubsidized loans, the interest is capitalized (added to the loan balance) if unpaid by the borrower as it accrues. This is in contrast with a forbearance, where the interest is the responsibility of the borrower on both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Find Private Student Loans for your School:
