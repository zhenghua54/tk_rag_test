Reason for foxtel satellite install, foxtel cable is the 1st preference for foxtel, if they can't find your street on their system then you get satellite, and also when there's no cable in street, there is no taps left on the cable system ($3000 upgrade out of your wallet if you want cable). I work for a contractor, I believe we're a good helpful team and here to give you a guide on installations and what the technician can and can't do. We don't do bodgy or crap jobs, this is what a professional install looks like. I do not know what your building looks like, so dont ask stupid questions.
