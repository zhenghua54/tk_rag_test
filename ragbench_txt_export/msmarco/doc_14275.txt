Feeding: Painted turtles eat a variety of foods, including meats such as crickets, worms or fish, and vegetables like mustard greens, spinach and carrots. They don't generally know when to stop eating, so be sure to remove excess food after 30 to 45 minutes. Painted turtles are an aquatic breed that loves to swim and bask on dry land interchangeably. Their swimming makes them an interesting focal point in your home, and the ease of painted turtle care makes them a great pet.
