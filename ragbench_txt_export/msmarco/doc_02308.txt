The government of the United States (the Union) rejected the claims of secession and considered the Confederacy illegitimate. The American Civil War began with the April 12, 1861 Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter, a Union fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. On March 11, 1861, the Confederate Constitution of seven state signatories— South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas — replaced the February 7 provisional Confederated States constitution with one stating in its preamble a desire for a permanent federal government.
