Since it is quite difficult to locate a hummingbird’s nest and therefore most of us may never see one for ourselves, I thought I would share with you some information about the hummingbird’s eggs and the length of their gestation period. In most cases, a female hummingbird will lay two eggs. So in general, the gestation period of hummingbird eggs is between two and three weeks, depending on the circumstances which are happening at the time. A hummingbird eggs will be white in color and only about the size of a pea or jelly bean.
