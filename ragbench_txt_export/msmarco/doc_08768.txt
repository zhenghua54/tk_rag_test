Basalt and granite are two types of igneous rocks. All rocks of igneous origin are made up of magma or molten earth that finds its way up to the surface of the earth from fissures and cracks underneath the surface of earth. The molten rocks that come out in the form of lava, upon cooling takes shape of igneous rocks. • Basalt is darker and is composed of magnesium and iron, whereas granite is lighter and is made up of feldspar and quartz. • Basalt is called mafic, while granite is called felsic. • Basalt splits along columnar planes, while granite splits along horizontal planes.
