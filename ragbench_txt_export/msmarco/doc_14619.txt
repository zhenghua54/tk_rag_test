Well, it gets worse. While most genomes are non-segmented (the genome is all on one piece of RNA or DNA), some genomes are segmented, meaning there are several fragments of DNA/RNA that make a complete virus genome. Also, some genomes are linear, meaning that there is a beginning and end to the genome, while other genomes are circular (no beginning and no end, Kind of like that friendship song, except by friends we mean piles of microscopic goo).
