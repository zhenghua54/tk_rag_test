The Akabane virus is an insect-transmitted virus that causes congenital abnormalities of the central nervous systems in ruminants. Two viruses, both arthropod borne, have been implicated in the cause of these congenital defects: Akabane virus, named after the district in Japan where it was first found, and Aino virus. Generally, both these viruses are referred to as Akabane virus.
