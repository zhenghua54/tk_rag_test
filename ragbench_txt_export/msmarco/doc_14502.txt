The average horse will intake 5 to 10 gallons of fresh water per day. Just like humans different horses crave or need different water amount intakes. A horse deprived of feed, but supplied drinking water, is capable of surviving 20 to 25 days. The feed consumed can determine the amount of water required: 1  Fresh pasture has between 60-80% moisture and can provide a large amount of the horse's water requirements when grazing. 2  Hay and grain are very low in moisture, causing horses to drink more water.
