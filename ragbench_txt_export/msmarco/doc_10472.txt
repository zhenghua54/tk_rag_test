Nerve disorders affect one or more of the bodyâ€™s nervous systems and can potentially impact speech, motor skills, cognitive ability, heart function, and even breathing. In addition to the central nervous system, specific disorders can also involve the autonomic nervous system or the peripheral nervous system. Degenerative, or progressive, nerve disorders are generally the most serious and difficult to treat. They also tend to run in families. These types of disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
