Avoid Vague Statements. Just because your small business's statement of purpose doesn't include your company's plans for business operations, doesn't mean you should be vague in crafting its language. A statement of purpose focused on function allows your business the flexibility to meet consumer needs regardless of the products your company currently offers for sale.
