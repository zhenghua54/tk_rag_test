CPT code 99051 is for services that are provided in the office during regularly schedule evening, weekend, or holiday hours. EVENING beginning is normally 5pm. CPT code 99050 is for services that are provided in the office other than regularly scheduled office hours, or days that the office is normally closed. I am hoping that you can help me try and make sure that we utilize this code correctly and begin to get reimbursed for it. They allow for $38 per weekend visit on the EOBs but have used a number of remarks to deny paying for the service.
