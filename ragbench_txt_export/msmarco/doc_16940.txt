The Aztec. The last of the great MesoAmerican cultures were the Aztec, they were a Nahuatl-speaking people, who in the 15th and early 16th centuries, ruled a large empire in what is now central and southern Mexico. Then there were the Toltecs, who dominated much of central Mexico around 1200 A.D. Their language “Nahuatl”, was also spoken by the Aztecs. They were a militaristic nomadic people, and they or their ancestors may have sacked the city of Teotihuacan in 750 A.D.
