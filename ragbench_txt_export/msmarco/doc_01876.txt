The absolute reticulocyte count is the number of reticulocytes in a volume of blood, which is a marker of RBC production. Reticulocytes are immature, but already anucleated, erythroid cells (RBCs) with residual detectable amounts of RNA, thereby capable of producing hemoglobin despite anucleation. The automated hematology analyzer can also report a measurement of reticulocyte-specific hemoglobin content as mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He), depending on the type of instrument used.
