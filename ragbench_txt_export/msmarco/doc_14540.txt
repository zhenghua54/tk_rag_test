2. Wear a splint. After a reduction of your broken toe, a splint is often put in place to support and protect the toe while it heals properly. Alternatively, you may have to wear a supportive compression boot, but either way, you'll likely need the use of crutches over the short term (2 weeks or so). Get a cast. If more than one toe is broken or other bones of the forefoot are injured (such as the metatarsals), then your doctor might apply a plaster or fiberglass cast to your entire foot.
