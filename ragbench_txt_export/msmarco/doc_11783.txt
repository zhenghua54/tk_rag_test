The third way of taking the temperature, is under the arm. (Called an axillary temperature.) Make sure the reading part of the thermometer is centered in the middle of the arm pit. Have the person hold their arm firmly against their body for one minute, (or until thermometer beeps). *Add* one degree to an axillary temperature to make it accurate. Note: this is not very accurate in people who are extremely thin, or who have had their arms in the air for a period of time. Nor is it accurate to obtain a temperature on someone who has hypothermia
