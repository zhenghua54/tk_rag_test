Scientists believe that mitochondria and chloroplasts were primitive cells without nuclei (prokaryotes) that got inside of primitive cells with nuclei (eukaryotes) and then stayed there. So they came in with their own DNA, and now they still have some of their own DNA that carries the code for some of their own proteins. They also need some proteins coded by genes in the nuclear DNA. A woman scientist first suggested all this, Lynn Margulis.
