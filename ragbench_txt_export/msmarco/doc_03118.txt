About 1 out of 3 people with lupus produce an antibody that attacks certain blood-clotting factors, which can cause the blood to clot easily. A person who has this antibody and has had blood clots is said to have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This can lead to mild or severe blood-clotting complications, including: 1  Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) , or heart attack. 2  Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
