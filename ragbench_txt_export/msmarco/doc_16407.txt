The Code permits an Equipment Grounding Circuit conductor to be bare or insulated. However, if the conductor is bare there may be some arcing between the bare conductor and the interior of the conduit at points other than the point at which the ground fault occurs. In the second category we could include all industrial plants where a metallic Equipment Grounding Circuit sized per Table 250-122, must be run parallel with and within the conductor enclosure so as to ensure continuity if that circuit is broken owing to corrosion sooner or later.
