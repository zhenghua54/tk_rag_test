Most canned cat foods are only at 11% protein analysis, which means you would need to feed a lot more. Canned cat food-not really. They are usually 75% moisture, meaning only 25% of good nutrients in the can. therefore, it would need to eat 4 cans of food for every one cup of normal food. Canned and dry food is generally in the same proportions with dry ingredients, but canned is just a lot more water.
