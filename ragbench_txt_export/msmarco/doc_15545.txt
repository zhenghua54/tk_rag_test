Another one: As for the difference in the ideal weight range according to body frame, assume that two adult females have the same height (5' 5) but different body frames (one has a small frame and the other has a large frame). The healthy weight for them is 113 to 138 pounds, and 137 to 155 pounds, respectively. Likewise, the correct weight values of an adult male and an adult female will vary significantly, even if their height is the same. This way, the ideal weight for people with the same height varies under different circumstances.
