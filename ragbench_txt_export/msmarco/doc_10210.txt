Take her to the vet. The average life span of a house cat is around 14 years old -- that's 10 years longer than the average for cats that live strictly outdoors, according to PetPlace.com. While your homebound furbaby won't encounter many of the dangers common to outdoors cats, she will need to see the vet regularly. Cats need to see the vet at least once a year because they need their vaccinations. While indoor cats don't need as many vaccinations as those that live primarily or partially outside, they need what are considered core vaccines necessary for all cats, according to WebMD.
