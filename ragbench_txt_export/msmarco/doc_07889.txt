Allotropy or allotropism (from Greek ἄλλος (allos) , meaning other, and τρόπος (tropos) , meaning manner, form) is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of these elements. For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O 2, and ozone, O 3), can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states.
