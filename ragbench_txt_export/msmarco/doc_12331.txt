One afternoon in late September, I opened the Uber app and requested a ride. For the unitiated, Uber is a hugely popular app that allows people to summon a private car with a few taps of their fingers. Since launching in 2009, the company has expanded to 34 countries, mainstreaming on-demand private transportation. Existing laws have prevented Uber from operating in Las Vegas, where the minimum time for a ride in a private car is one hour and in Miami, where a reservation for a limousine is required to be made an hour in advance, with a minimum fare of $80.
