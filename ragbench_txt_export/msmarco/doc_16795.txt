The device eventually compose layer o f the channel when gate voltage is increased further gate MOSFET as in Fig. 3(e). This structure exhibits $%& 'Jan(June)1*+ % fides on the bulk the channel fully ase of single gate G) structure is a. A junctionless at bottom of the. The superiorities of the BPJLT over the present JLT versions are better scalability, the existence of two surplus controls for tuning the device performance.
