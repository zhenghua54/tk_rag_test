For repainting the car yourself, you will need various tools such as covers, spray gun, paints etc. Now the cost of the paint can range anywhere from $100 to $1,000, as you will need to apply several layers of the paint, if you want the paint last for long time. If your entire vehicle needs only a simple tire removal, masking and spray paint, you will find that the job will cost between $400- $500, plus tax, if your state charges a service tax. The cost to repaint a car depends on other factors, such as repair work. If your car is in a condition where the mechanic needs to work on the body to bring it back to good condition, it could raise the cost of the repainting significantly
