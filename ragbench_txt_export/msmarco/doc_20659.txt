Uses. To achieve weight loss with whey protein, you need to use it in a smart way. Rather than adding extra calories to your diet by drinking a whey shake in addition to meals, use the shake as a replacement for a daily snack or small meal. Since many bodybuilders and weight trainers use whey protein in an effort to add muscle mass, it might come as a surprise that it can also encourage weight loss.
