Explore the best of YOUR world one waterfall at a time! Spencer Gorge / Dundas / near Waterdown / Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Rating: 3 Difficulty: 1. Tews Falls was a very attractive plunge waterfall dropping about 41m (said to be the tallest in Southern Ontario besides Niagara Falls). We also could have come to the car park from Webster's Falls. See that page for directions for its waterfall. However, at the intersection of Harvest Rd and Short Rd, continue east on Harvest Rd for another 400m or so towards the Tews Falls car park on the right.
