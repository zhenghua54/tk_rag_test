It was the civilization of Greece from the Archaic, period of the 8th/6th centuries BC to 146 BC. The period ended with the Roman conquest of Greece in the Battle of Corinth. For most of this time the Greeks did not have a single government or ruler. There were a number of city states, each with its own constitution.
