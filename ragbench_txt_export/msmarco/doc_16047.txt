A small amount of bilirubin in your blood is normal, but a high level may be a sign of liver disease. The liver produces bile to help you digest food, and bile contains bilirubin. Most bilirubin comes from the body's normal process of breaking down old red blood cells. A healthy liver can normally get rid of bilirubin. But when you have liver problems, it can build up in your body to unhealthy levels.
