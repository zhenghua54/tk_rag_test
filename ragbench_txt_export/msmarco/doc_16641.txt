Porcelain tile is generally made by pressing porcelain clays, which results in a tile that's dense, impervious, fine grained, and smooth with a sharply formed face. Porcelain tiles usually have a much lower water absorption rate than ceramic tiles, making them more frost resistant, although not frost proof.
