Avoid using weed and feed if you plan to reseed your lawn in the same season. As a general rule, you can apply weed and feed in the spring and overseed in the fall and be safe. Summer is hard on lawns. The heat, drought, insects and increased traffic can really take their toll on your lawn during the summer months.
