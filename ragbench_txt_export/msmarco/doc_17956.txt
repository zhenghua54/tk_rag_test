The drug Molly is the crystal or powder form of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine), a chemical used in the street drug Ecstasy. Because it is purportedly free of adulterants, such as methamphetamine or caffeine, Molly is commonly touted as being a safer drug than Ecstasy. Molly also inhibits the body's ability to regulate temperature, resulting in hyperthermia, or elevated body temperature. While Molly is sometimes considered a pure form of MDMA, it often contains other drugs.
