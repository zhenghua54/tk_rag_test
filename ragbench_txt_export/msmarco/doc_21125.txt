I need to know how the IMRC actuator and valve position sensor and solenoid work on 2002 Honda CR-V. I pulled a p1077 code at AutoZone. Definition: IMRC valve stuck short. Probable cause: Check for mechanical condition. Open or short circuit condition. Failed IMRC actuator. I ran several tests. I got 5v from the valve position sensor 3p connector Nos. 1 and 3 with the ignition on. Check resistance between sensor side of valve position sensor terminals Nos. 2 and 3, should read 3.2 kOhm, I got 2939. Then check resistance between terminals Nos. 1 and 2.
