With the access cover removed, you'll see the fuel tank sending unit right there on top. It will have a wiring harness plugged into the top (this tells your gas gauge how much fuel is in the tank). Unplug the wiring harness and move it safely to the side. If your fuel tank sending unit is screwed or bolted in place, remove the screws or bolts. Some sending units are a twist-lock type.
