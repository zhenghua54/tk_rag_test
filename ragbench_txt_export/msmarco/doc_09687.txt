In addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while Truth and Method became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, Plato and Aristotle specifically. Gadamer's philosophical project, as explained in Truth and Method, was to elaborate on the concept of  philosophical hermeneutics , which Heidegger initiated but never dealt with at length.
