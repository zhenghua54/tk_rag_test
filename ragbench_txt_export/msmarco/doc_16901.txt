Isometric drawing is the most commonly used method of pictorial drawing. Isometric drawings are built on three lines, called isometric axes. One is drawn vertically and the other two with the 30Â° set square either side of it. An Isometric drawing is a way of presenting designs in three dimensions (3D). They can be completed using the 30/60 set square or freehand. An Isometric drawing is one of a family of three-dimensional views called pictorial drawings.
