Osmosis: (seeing Thrax in Frank's subconscious in a movie theater) Thrax is alive! Thrax is alive and in Frank's brain! Makeout teen: Thanks for spoiling the ending! 1  Stealth Pun: After Thrax first appears, he saunters along the boat while humming the melody from Fever. 1 The false eyelash that Shane's friend gives her. 2  In the climax, Ozzy and Thrax duke it out on top of it. 3  Thrax doesn't realize that it's fake until he gets his hand stuck in it...just before it falls off of Shane's eye into a beaker of alcohol. 4  Cue dramatic death scene.
