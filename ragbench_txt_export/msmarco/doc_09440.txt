To find the official BSA kit, try to locate your nearest Scout Council Service Center or Scout Shop, which should have a good number of kits on hand. Go the the BSA website and enter your zip code, and it will find the council nearest to you. You can then click through to the council's site or you can call them to get the location of the shop. If you don't have a council shop near you, you can order them directly from the BSA's online store, ScoutStuff.org. They're currently $3.99. You can also get accessories for the cars there.
