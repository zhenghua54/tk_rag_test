1. World Vision’s core mission is to focus intentionally on the well-being of children. By partnering closely with local community groups, churches, families, and children themselves, we address root causes of poverty that directly impact children, especially the most vulnerable. World Vision sponsorship is designed toward our belief that the most effective way to provide for a child is to address issues at the community level to improve the situation for all children and to reflect God’s love as we serve.
