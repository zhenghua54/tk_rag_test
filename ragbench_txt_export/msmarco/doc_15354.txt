Hey guys we got some new stuff at the hammer inn to try as handle scales. Its called Kirinite from eagle grips (Raj M Singh) Works kind of like plastic but tuffer,be careful not to heat up to high and this stuff is cool,the lines in it look 3-d after you buff it out. 7,719. At this point USAknifemaker.com will be the exclusive dealer for Kirinite knife handle material-at least initially. We will be starting with 6 different color pallets/patterns in 4 thicknesses (1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 3/8). We are still working through the initial dealer set up and hopefully we can move it right along
