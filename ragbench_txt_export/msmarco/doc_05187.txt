When you ovulate (or release an egg from your ovary), that egg has a chance of getting fertilized. When that egg gets fertilized, you're pregnant! You're most fertile from two to three days before you ovulate through the day of ovulation. If you know when you'll ovulate, you can time sex accordingly and boost your chances of getting pregnant (or of preventing pregnancy, if that's what you're trying to do).
