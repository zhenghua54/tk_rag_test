Dogs of all ages and breeds are susceptible to lungworm, with playful, younger dogs (less than two years old), unsurprisingly, more prone to picking up the parasite. Dogs known to purposely eat slugs and snails are obviously considered higher risk. Unlike many diseases, however, lungworm is not actually passed directly from dog to dog. The worm needs slug and snail hosts in order to grow and develop, and it's from eating these that infection may occur, then by the dog passing larvae in its waste.
