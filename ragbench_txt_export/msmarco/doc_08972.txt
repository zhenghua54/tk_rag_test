I arrived at the airport way too early. Even the full-body scanners and other enhanced security measures here in Washington don't change the fact that Saturday is a slow travel day. Two hours early for a domestic flight is way, way too much if you're travelling on Saturday. It's probably too much even if you're leaving from LaGaurdia, O'Hare, or some other nightmare airport and planning to check bagsâ€”even then, there's a good chance you'll be waiting a while to board. If I could predict how long it would take to get to LAX from my home, I'd fine tune things. I must budget 2 hours for a minimum 45 min trip to the airport with another 90 min for check-in and security. Heaven knows I'd like to leave later, but it's a cushion painful history has taught me to keep.
