EQUIPMENT GROUND ING CONDUCTOR An equipment ground ing conductor is a wire that connects non-current-carrying metal parts such as raceways, enclosures, and the metal frames of equipment, appliances, motors, etc. back to the main bonding jumper (also referred to as a “bus link ”). The purpose of grounding is to stabilize voltage in relation to the earth or to another body that serves in place of the earth so that the voltage measured between an unground ed conductor (also referred to as the “hot,” “live,” or phase conductor) and a grounded object is always at the same potential which is zero.
