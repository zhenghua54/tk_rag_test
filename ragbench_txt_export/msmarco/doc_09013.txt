It’s a good idea to wait until baby’s about six months old to take him in the pool. It’s not unhealthy to expose him to chlorine before then, but baby should be holding his head up properly before you take him in the water. That way, he’ll be sturdier and you can have a firmer, more assured grasp on him. Plus, that’s about the age when baby will start being able to splash and kick and really enjoy being in the pool. Some parents believe that the earlier you take your child to swimming lessons, the better a swimmer he’ll become.
