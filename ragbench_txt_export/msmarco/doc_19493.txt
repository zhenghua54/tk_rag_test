I am using a PS/2 Keyboard. If the settings are kept like in the photo, only the mouse can turn the system on. If I enable PS/2 keyboard then I can start the pc with either the keyboard or the mouse. My bios is up to date. My mobo is 7 years old, they havent released a bios update in ages. Every device that can wake the computer is disabled in the BIOS, and in Device manager the allow this device to wake the computer option is unchecked. I dont know what else to do to make this stop. My Motherboard is an Asus P5E3. This is a new mouse, Microsoft Wireless Mouse 4000.
