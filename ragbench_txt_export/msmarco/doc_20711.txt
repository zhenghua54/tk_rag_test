Bacteria-the first organisms to be genetically engineered-are used for replicating and altering genes that are subsequently introduced into plants or animals. Bacteria are routinely used to produce non-bacterial proteins. An example is the production of purified proteins for vaccine use. Such proteins can be safer and as effective as vaccines that contain killed or attenuated (weakened) pathogens.
