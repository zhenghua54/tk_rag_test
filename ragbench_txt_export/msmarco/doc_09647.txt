But, personally I prefer using Dettol liquid handwash over Dettol soap for washing my hands as it gives me that thoroughly cleansed feeling. (You can buy Dettol Liquid Soap 250 ml liquid soap from Amazon .). But be aware of the fact that excessive usage of antibacterial soaps and liquid handwashes is not deemed healthy. Dothese, Dont use cream ,face lotion,try to use normal soap. Drink plenty of water,try to steam bath. Excercise so that sweat itself do the cleaning of ur skin insideout. Dont use too much soap ,washingtwice a day enough. Run from oily ,fried foods,especialy fast food.
