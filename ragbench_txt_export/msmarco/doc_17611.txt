An eligible educational institution is a school offering higher education beyond high school. It is any college, university, vocational school, or other post secondary educational institution eligible to participate in a student aid program run by the U.S. Department of Education. This includes most accredited public, nonprofit and privately-owned–for-profit postsecondary institutions. If you aren’t sure if your school is an eligible educational institution: • Ask your school if it is an eligible educational institution, or. • See if your school is on the U.S. Federal Student Aid Code List.
