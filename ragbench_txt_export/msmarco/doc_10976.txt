Splanchnic means having to do with the viscera (i.e., internal organs). Sympathetic preganglionic axons (orange lines) emerge from the cord and pass through ganglia of the sympathetic chain (line of yellow circles) without synapsing. They gather into three nerves called the. From here, postganglionic axons (dashed blue line) synapse with their receptors within the organ. These ganglia (large yellow circles) are named the. . They sit just ventral to the aorta and the nerves entering and leaving them are intertwined forming a plexus. This entire region is called the 'solar plexus'.
