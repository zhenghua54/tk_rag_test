Sales per square foot of store space can be considered a key measure of efficiency in retail. In the clothing industry, according to RetailSails, sales per square foot for Nordstrom is $400, compared with just $173 for Macy’s. At $350, Saks Fifth Avenue’s sales per square foot approaches Nordstrom’s. But, then look at Ross stores where the figure was $355 in 2012.
