Vitamins. Aloe vera gel is packed with vitamins. It contains B-12, which helps make DNA, and also maintains blood and nerve cells. The gel contains folic acid, which makes new cells and prevents birth defects. Skin lotions and topical anti-inflammatory treatments tout aloe vera as a healing and soothing wonder gel. The gel comes from the thick leaves of the aloe vera plant. It does more than just leave skin soft, however.
