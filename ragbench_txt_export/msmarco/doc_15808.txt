Fee simple is sometimes called fee simple absolute because it is the most complete form of ownership. A fee simple buyer is given title (ownership) of the property, which includes the land and any improvements to the land in perpetuity. Aside from a few exceptions, no one can legally take that real estate from an owner with fee simple title. Most people only know of one type of real estate ownership; fee simple, also known as freehold. There are a handful of states that have another form of ownership known as leasehold. The difference in these two types of land tenure is very different and affects the value of the real estate.
