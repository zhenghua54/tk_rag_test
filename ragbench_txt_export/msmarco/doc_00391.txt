THE NAME HENDERSON. The Name Henderson is the modern version of an ancient Scottish patronymic; that is, a name derived when children of the first generation are known as their father's sons (Henry's sons). In the next step, it becomes a single name (Henrison) and then the name becomes a permanent surname. We are aware on the basis of Henderson family lore of several fathers named Henry who passed their name in this fashion.
