In continuous-servo AF (AF-C), the camera will continue to focus if the shutter-release button is kept pressed halfway after the camera focuses. Because the camera continues to focus up to the moment the shutter-release button is pressed all the way down, this mode is a good choice for subjects that are in motion. AF-C: No Focus Lock. If you change the composition after focusing in AF-C mode, the camera will refocus on the object that is now in the focus point, making it impossible to lock focus using the shutter-release button.
