Season the roast, sear it in hot oil and cook it in a 250 degree Fahrenheit oven for roughly 30 minutes per pound. One of the keys to keeping it tender is to slice it very thin just as you find in a delicatessen. In fact, if you purchase roast beef in a deli, there is a good chance you are getting rump roast.
