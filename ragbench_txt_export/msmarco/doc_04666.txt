English and Scottish: from a Celtic personal name of great antiquity and obscurity. In England the personal name is now usually spelled Alan, the surname Allen; in Scotland the surname is more often Allan. Various suggestions have been put forward regarding its origin; the most plausible is that it originally meant 'little rock'. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Alriz Sellere. This was dated 1086, in the recordfs known as the Inquisitio Eliensis of Cambridgeshire, during the reign of King William 1st of England, 1066 - 1087.
