Complete Physical Maturity: Mice are not done growing until they are between 3 and 5 months of age, depending on the line. Mice should NEVER be bred until they are at least 12 weeks age. If you don't know the line really well, wait until at least 12 weeks, if not longer. (wild mice live longer.. around 5 years in captivity, though only around 6 months in the wild due to predators and environmental factors). Maturity: 4 - 8 weeks of age, varying from line to line and mouse to mouse. This is the time that males and females can become fertile
