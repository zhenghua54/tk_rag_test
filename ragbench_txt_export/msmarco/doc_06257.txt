1 An electronic meat thermometer can be programmed to beep when the meat hits the target temperature. 2  Beef and lamb are medium rare when the internal temperature of the roast has reached 135°F; medium is 140°-145°F. Pork should be cooked to 145°F. 3  Veal is usually served medium (145°-150°F) or medium-well (155°F). 1 Place the meat in the oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes at the high temperature. 2  Then lower the temperature to between 275°F and 325°F and roast until done (see doneness guidelines below).
