RNA stands for ribonucleic acid and like DNA, RNA nucleotides contain three components: RNA nitrogenous bases include adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). The five-carbon (pentose) sugar in RNA is ribose. RNA molecules are polymers of nucleotides joined to one another by covalent bonds between the phosphate of one nucleotide and the sugar of another. These linkages are called phosphodiester linkages.
