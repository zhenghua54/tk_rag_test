I have Pirelli now and need new tires. My tire supplier is offerring me a choice between Pirelli and Continental. Of course, he has other tires, but he feels he can get me the best value on one of these two brands. I'm not at all familiar with the Continental tires. Pirelli has great size selection, but other than that I'd rather have the cheaper, longer lasting Continental CS2's. Unfortunately I believe there is a national backorder on the CS2's as I recently tried to purchase them for my new wheels coming in.
