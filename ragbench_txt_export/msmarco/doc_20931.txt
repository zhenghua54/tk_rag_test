Beyond the realm of fantasy, initial franchise fees add a significant percentage to the already substantial costs of opening a new business. At the time of publication, McDonald's initial franchise fee amounts to $45,000. Your burgers might be a thousand times better than those served by McDonald's, but if no one tastes them you cannot make a profit. Your initial franchise fee helps you circumvent that challenge by including your restaurant in a chain with the advantage of instant name recognition.
