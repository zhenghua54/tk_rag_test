1.2.1 Activity (being active, functional ability). Activity is used in occupational therapy as the general term for everything a person does, would like to do or what is expected of him. Functional ability means being able to plan activities and to perform them. WWhich activities a person needs in daily living at any one given point in his life and which are of particular importance to him are partly determined by the roles he assumes or has to assume in his environment (e.g. role of a mother, role of an employee). Occupational therapy takes these into account.
