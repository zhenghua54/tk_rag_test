Educational Requirements. In order to become an aeronautical engineer, prospective candidates must complete a bachelor's degree program, usually in aerospace or aeronautical engineering. A program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be required to later earn licensure. Once EITs have completed the required experience, they may take the second exam to become professional aeronautical engineers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), job opportunities for aerospace engineers were projected to increase 7% from 2012-2022, which is slower than average.
