Researchers for the British charity Pond Conservation have defined a pond to be 'a man-made or natural waterbody which is between 1 m 2 and 20,000 m 2 in area (2 ha or ~5 acres), which holds water for four months of the year or more.' Other European biologists have set the upper size limit at 5 ha (12 acres).
