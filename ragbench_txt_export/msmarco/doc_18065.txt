1 Record how many chapters you have to read. 2  Separate reading times into different groups. 3  Take breaks in between. 4  For example, if the book has 40 chapters, you can read 8 chapters at a time and take 4 or 5 minute breaks in between. 5  This way, you'll have 5 breaks, because 40 divided by 8 equals 5. 1 Now, just estimate how much time each time period will be reading each group of chapters plus the breaks in between. 2  Add up all the time periods to get a final answer of the total amount of time it will take you to read the whole book.
