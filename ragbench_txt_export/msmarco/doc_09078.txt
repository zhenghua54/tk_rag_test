All guests under 21 years of age when boarding must be accompanied by a parent or guardian in the same stateroom. On some sailings, even guests 21-24 years of age must have at least one person in the stateroom who is at least 25 years old and will agree to be responsible for the under-25 year old guests. In addition, guests only need to be 18 years of age or older to book and cruise on their own. Several cruise lines, such as Holland America and Norwegian Cruise Line, require minors under the age of 18 who are cruising unaccompanied by one or both of their parents to produce notarized documents before boarding.
