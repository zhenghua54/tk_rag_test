Beta carotene When it comes to nutritional supplementation, and antioxidants in particular, beta carotene is an antiaging micronutrient of the highest order, standing firmly alongside Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and the mineral Selenium in its ability to reduce illness, improve overall health, and increase longevity. Foods such as carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, watermelon, apricots, and mangoes are good sources of beta-carotene; romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, and broccoli are also rich in carotenoids (the yellow color is covered up by chlorophyll in green leafy plants).
