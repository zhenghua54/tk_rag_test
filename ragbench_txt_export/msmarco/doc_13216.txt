Arcus senilis, also known as arcus corneae, is a gray or white arc visible above and below the outer part of the cornea â€” the clear, dome-like covering over the front of the eye. Eventually, the arc may become a complete ring around the cornea. Arcus senilis is common in older adults. It's caused by fat (lipid) deposits deep in the edge of the cornea. It isn't related to high cholesterol, however.
