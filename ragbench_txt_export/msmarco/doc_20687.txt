A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is one that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it does not express a complete thought. Like all clauses, a dependent clause has a subject and verb. Here are some examples of dependent clauses (shaded). Notice how the shaded clauses could not stand alone as sentences. This is how a dependent clause differs from an independent clause. Dependent clauses can act as adjectives, adverbs, or nouns.
