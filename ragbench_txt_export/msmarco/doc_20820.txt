I am doing this very important piece of homework on 'the lady of shalott' by alfred lord tennyson and i need to find what this word means. ty bex xxx. In the time of Alfred Lord Tennyson, -th was often put on the end of verbs, so I am guessing that Tennyson used flitteth to mean flitted or was flitting. Something like She flitteth about like a dove in a grain store.
