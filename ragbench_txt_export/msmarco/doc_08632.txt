Federal Direct Loans 1 are student loans with their interest rate set by federal law and regulations. Student loans come in both subsidized and unsubsidized versions. Subsidized means that the government is subsidizing (paying) the interest while the student is enrolled and often when in a grace period 2. They are not interest-free loans but are not accumulating interest during defined periods. Unsubsidized loans are collecting interest from the point of disbursement.
