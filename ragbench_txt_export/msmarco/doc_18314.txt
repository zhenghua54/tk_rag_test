THHN wire is another type of wire used quite a bit in the industry. THHN / THWN wire is used in all Romex cables and UFB cables with different protective jackets that allow it to be used in different applications. THHN wire has a PVC insulation with a nylon coating to protect against weather, gas and solvents. It can be used outdoors or in conduit but it cannot be direct buried without the use on conduit. Our underground cables listed in awg sizes above are very useful and not that expensive. UFB cable can be used in any way you need outdoors because weather and moisture have no change on penetrating the UFB jacket.
