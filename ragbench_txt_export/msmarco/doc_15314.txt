Appearance. The wood-grain appearance on vinyl windows is a popular alternative to actual wood, which is more problematic than either vinyl or aluminum. Itâ€™s also superior to the painted surface of aluminum windows. To get the look of wood on an aluminum window requires the use of a coating treatment. This is inferior to the vinyl wood grain effect, which is the same material throughout, as opposed to an external coating. Corrosion. Not a problem with vinyl windows
