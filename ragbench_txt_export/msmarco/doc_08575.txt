BSC means Basic Spacing Between Centers. This is often used if the reference lines don't refer to a physical point or edge, like in the case of the pins: the reference is in the middle of the pin, instead of one of the edges. Thus 7.00 BSC is equivalent to 7mm, with the spacing measured between centers (not really the centers of anything in the specific example of one side being 7mm between centers). share | improve this answer.
