As a general rule, most people expect that the labor for a remodel will cost roughly twice as much as the materials did. This is not a hard and fast rule, but the numbers generally support the claim. On average, a bathroom remodeling job will cost you around twice as much as the materials cost you.

This would include the labor to completely redo tile, completely install new fixtures, complete any necessary wiring and plumbing, and have everything inspected afterward
