Pectoralis major. A chest muscle that pulls the arm in towards the body. This is one of the internal rotator muscles that attach the humerus and internally rotate the arm. The pectoralis major originates along the clavicle, down the sternum, and across the ribs and inserts into the humerus. Itâ€™s the largest and the most outermost of the three flat muscles of the outside front of the abdomen. It has limited actions in both flexion and rotation of the vertebral column. One side of the obliques contracting can create lateral flexion.
