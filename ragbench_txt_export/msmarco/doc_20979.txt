For example, you might charge a flat rate of $9 per 500-word page for transcription, regardless of editing or content. Break your flat rates by service categories, such as resumes, essays, dictations or transcription. Offer flat rate add-on features as well, such as $15 per page for fact-checking. To see if you're charging similar to the competition and to make sure you're not overpriced, call or browse the website of other home-based typing services and see what they charge for their services.
