A: HCTZ is a commonly used abbreviation for the medication, hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic or water pill that can be used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (fluid retention). Hydrochlorothiazide may also be prescribed to treat calcium-containing kidney stones because it decreases the amount of calcium excreted by the kidneys in the urine, thus reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones.
