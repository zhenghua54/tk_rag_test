A cognate is a word derived from the same root as another word. Cognates are words that have a common origin (source). They may occur in a language or in a group of languages. The word 'cognate' is derived from the Latin word 'cognatus' meaning 'to be born with'. In reading Churchill 's History of the English Speaking Peoples, it would be well to keep in mind (remember) what George Bernard Shaw says:  England and America are two countries divided by a common language..
