The Hajj must be made between the eighth and the 13th days of the 12th month (called Dhu al-Hijjah) of the Muslim lunar year. In a general sense, the Pilgrimage begins with the donning of the Ihram, a white seamless garment. For the duration of the Hajj, Mecca and the Sanctuary that surrounds it have a special status. To cross the frontiers of the Haram--which lie outside Mecca between three and 18 miles from the Ka'bah--pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia must now have a special Hajj visa in their passports.
