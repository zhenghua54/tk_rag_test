A pork picnic shoulder, also called a pork arm shoulder, is cut from the lower portion of the pig's shoulder. If left fresh, the cut of meat may be called a pork picnic shoulder roast or a fresh pork picnic ham. Adding smoke creates a smoked picnic shoulder ham that may be boneless or bone in. Place the ham in your preheated oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. A meat thermometer inserted into the picnic shoulder will help you to determine when the meat is done. Allow about 30 minutes per pound cooking time
