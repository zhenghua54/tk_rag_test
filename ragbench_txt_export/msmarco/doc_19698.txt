Customer Service. A property claims representative must interact with claimants who may or may not be customers of the carrier he represents. It is the job of the representative to make contact with claimants and schedule a time to inspect the property damage. Communicating with customers throughout the claims process is a routine aspect of a property claims representative's job.
