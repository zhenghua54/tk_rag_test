Safflower oil is a colorless, flavorless, and odorless edible oil extracted from the safflower plant. Safflower’s history dates back to the ancient times, with the crop cultivated for its use in fabric dyes. Today, safflower is mainly farmed for its seeds which is the source of this plant’s edible oil. So unless safflower oil is taken alongside edible oils like olive oil, which by the way are high in monounsaturated fats and therefore will not lower the HDL levels, then steering clear of safflower oil would then be prudent.
