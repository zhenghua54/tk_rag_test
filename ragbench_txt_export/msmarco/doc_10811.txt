For a person consuming 2000 calories, this is about 200 calories per day (or 50 grams and about 12 teaspoons a day). Here's how to translate from calories to grams to teaspoons. Use the divide by 4 rule of simple sugar math. Take the calories and divide by 4 to get the grams of added sugar. When it comes to added sugars in the diet, here's the bottom line: For 2000 calories per day, 50 grams of added sugars, about 12 teaspoons. Start with your calories, and use the first 3 numbers for the 10 percent added sugar goal (1,500 daily calories is 150; 2,400 daily calories is 240).
