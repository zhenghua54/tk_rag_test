Family daycare is usually less expensive than daycare centers, preschools, and in-home childcare options like nannies and au pairs. Parents choosing to utilize family daycare can expect to pay on average $300 to $800 per month per child. According to the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA), there are slight differences in price with age. Full-time care for an infant family daycare can range from $3,900 to $9,630 per year, while the same care for a 4 year old fulltime may cost from $3,380 to $9,146. Your rates will increase if you enroll more than one child in family daycare. {Continued: Geographic Location }. Geographic Location
