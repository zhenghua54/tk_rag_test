Consider the ingredients -- flour, yeast, water, sauce, cheese and toppings. None of these are expensive -- think about the cost at the grocery store. To build a medium pizza the cheese is the most expensive ingredient at $2.00, with the dough adding about $0.25 and the sauce $0.35. That adds up to $2.60 for a basic pizza that could be sold for twice that amount. There are, of course, other expenses to be factored into the cost.
