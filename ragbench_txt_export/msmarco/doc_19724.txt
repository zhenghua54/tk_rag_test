(Petaurus Breviceps). A Sugar Glider is a small marsupial possum found in the tree tops of Australia, Tasmania, Indonesia, and Papua-New Guinea. They are so named because they have a preference for sweet foods and a patagium (gliding membrane). The gliding membrane is connected from the wrist to the ankle.
