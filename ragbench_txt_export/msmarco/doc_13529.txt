0. It is called a rain forest because at the end of the day you will find that it will always rain. The sun heats the earth and warms the air above it. As it rises it cools and forms clouds. By the time this has happened it is the end of the day and it starts to pour down. The sun only heats the earth to a temperature high enough near the equator because that part is nearest the sun. You won't find this happening anywhere else except the equator and so you don't find tropical rainforests anywhere esle
