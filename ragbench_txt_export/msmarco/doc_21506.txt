Trimethoprim is an antibiotic that is used for bladder infections, marketed under the brand names Proloprim, Monotrim and Triprim. It is the most widely prescribed drug for bladder infections because few infection strains are resistant to it. You should not take trimethoprim if you are also taking dofetilide, methotrexate or cyclosporine because it can cause dangerous interactions. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic used to treat bladder infections and is sold under the names Macrobid and Macrodantin. It prevents bacteria from forming cell walls and limits their ability to survive and reproduce.
