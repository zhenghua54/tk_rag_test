Loan origination fees come in two flavors. Some lenders use the term for closing costs such as appraisal fees, title fees, legal expenses and prepaid property taxes, none of which is deductible. You only get a deduction when the fees -- also called maximum loan charges or discount points -- represent prepaid interest. Your lender may charge you for both deductible and non-deductible loan origination fees. The settlement statement you get at closing should clearly identify the prepaid interest so you can sort out the two types of fees.
