Even if there’s a hearing, the court can still decide to issue a possession order. If the judge makes a possession order, you’ll normally have 14 or 28 days to leave the property. If this will cause you exceptional hardship, the judge may give you up to 42 days to leave. If you don’t leave at this point, your landlord can use bailiffs to evict you.
