At 13 months, your baby may be walking on his own, but probably a bit unsteadily. If your baby still hasn't stopped cruising, it just means walking on his own is going to take a little longer. Some children don't walk until they are 17 months or 18 months old. Most babies take their first steps by their first birthday. By the time they're 15 months old, most toddlers are walking unaided, though often with uneven steps (Harding 2014, Sheridan 2008) . Try not to worry if your baby takes a little longer. Some children don't walk until they are 17 months or 18 months old (NHS 2013a) . Babies who bottom-shuffle tend to walk later than babies who crawl (Sheridan 2008)
