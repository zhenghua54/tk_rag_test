Usually ketosteril will be prescribed by the doctors if the patients progress from the third stage to the 4th stage of renal failure when their GFR is lower than 25. The main components of ketosteril are amino acids and calcium amino acid compounds. As has been mentioned above, ketosteril treatment needs to be combined with low-protein diets to consolidate the curative effects of ketosteril. Adult kidney failure patients should have no more than 40g protein everyday and it can be taken as long term treatment because ketosteril has very low toxicity to the kidneys.
