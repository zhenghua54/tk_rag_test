GAA requires that you check out how many minutes the goalie has played. GAA = (Goals allowed * 60)/ minutes played For example. If a goalie has given up 3 goals and then gets pulled for the final minute, his GAA is not 3.00. It would actually be 3.05. Same thing for if a goalie gets pulled at intermission. For the save percentage you divide the number of saves by the number of shots. For EX. 24/25 = 96% For goals against Average you divide the number of goals against by the number of games played. For EX. 80/46=1.74 GAA. Jophis23 Â· 7 years ago.
