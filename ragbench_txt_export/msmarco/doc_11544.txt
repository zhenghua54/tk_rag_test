Treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) depends on the severity of the condition and how long you have had it. In some cases, CTS will improve after a few months without treatment. Moving your hand or shaking your wrist can often help relieve the symptoms. During surgery the roof of the carpal tunnel, known as the carpal ligament, is cut to reduce pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. A local anaesthetic is used to numb your hand and wrist, but you will remain awake throughout the operation.
