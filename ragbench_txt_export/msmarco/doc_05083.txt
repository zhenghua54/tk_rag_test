Well this is a pretty simply question for a very complex topic. Mitochondria can vary within a cell type depending on environmental and life history variables. Some cell types â€¦ have high mitochondria density, but are quite small (sperm) and some have lower mitochondrial density but are much larger (muscle cells). Other cells, like intestinal wall lining for example, also contain a lot of mitochondria.
