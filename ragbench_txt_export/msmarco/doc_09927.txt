Review 1 for Not Eggshell Overall Rating 1 out of 5 ByKRH. 12 October 2013. Keep away! Dulux Eggshell should be called Dulux Semi-Gloss, it has a high shine and it is NOT what I would call Eggshell. I have been a painter for over 40 years, this paint has caused me a lot of problems with my customers.
