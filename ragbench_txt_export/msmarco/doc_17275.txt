Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a Turk as anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship; therefore, the legal use of the term Turkish as a citizen of Turkey is different from the ethnic definition. The Turks today are a nation in the meaning of an ethnos, defined by possessing Turkish culture and having a Turkish mother tongue, rather than by citizenship, race, religion or by being subjects of any particular state.
