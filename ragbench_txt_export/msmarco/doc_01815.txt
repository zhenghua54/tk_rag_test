The bearded dragon will lay about 20-30 eggs. The eggs should be incubated at 82 to 84Â° F for a period of 65-75 days. About 24 hours before the eggs are due to hatch they will start to collapse. Newly hatched dragons should be left in the incubator for a period of 24 hours to allow the yolk sac to be absorbed. When first born, baby bearded dragons are just under 4 inches in length and weigh about 1/10 of an ounce (2 1/2-3 grams). Adults typically are 19-23 inches and weight at least 3/4 of a pound (250 grams). The German giant morphn type can reach up to 26 inches in length.
