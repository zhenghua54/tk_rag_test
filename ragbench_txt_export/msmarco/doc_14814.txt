Cook over medium heat for 20 minutes. Add 1-cup water and continue cooking until tender, 25 to 40 minutes. In a skillet, heat oil, then add remaining ingredients, except potato, to make the sofrito. Turn down heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add sofrito mixture and diced potato to beans. Turn on heat again to medium and cook additional 20 minutes or until mixture thickens and potatoes are fork-tender.
