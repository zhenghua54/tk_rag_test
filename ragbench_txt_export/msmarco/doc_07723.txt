During inhalation the diaphragm muscle contracts and this causes it to (effectively) move downwards, its previously upwardly curving shape becomes a flatter one, and this decreases the pressure in the thorax region (the region in which the lungs reside) because there is more air space. When the volume of the lungs increases, the pressure within the lungs decreases and so air flows in. When the diaphragm relaxes it resumes its dome shaped and compresses the lungs increasing the pressure inside them and so air flows out. That's the extended version. The function of the diaphragm is to help you breathe.
