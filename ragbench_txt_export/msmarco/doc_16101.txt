Almost all dyes typically used for clothing, especially commercially-made clothing, are synthetic, not made from natural sources. They are made from chemicals that ultimately derive from either coal or petroleum. Indigo, a very popular dye used for blue denim, can be derived from plants such as the indigo plant or woad—there are some fifty species of plants around the world that produce this popular dye—but in actual practice, these days, it is produced synthetically.
