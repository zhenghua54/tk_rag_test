How much is PMI? Conventional Mortgage insurance rates vary — usually, the lower your down payment and/or the lower your credit score, the higher the premiums — but typically the premiums can range from $30-70 per month for every $100,000 borrowed. So, if you bought a $300,000 home, you might pay about $150 per month for mortgage insurance. On FHA loans, there is an up-front MIP (mortgage insurance premium) and annual premium which is collected monthly. VA loans have an up-front fee(funding fee) and no annual or monthly premiums.
