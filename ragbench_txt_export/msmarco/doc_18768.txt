Best Answer: The price varies depending on dealers. I'm a former cocaine user (not proud of it) so I'll try my best to help you. a gram is usually between 20-60 dollars depending on quality of cocaine. an ounce is usually around 1,000-1,400 bucks. If you buy 1/8 of a gram, usually called 8ball, it is usually around 120-150 bucks. If you buy 1/4 of a gram, it is usually 250-350 bucks. Obviously, a pound would cost a lot of money
