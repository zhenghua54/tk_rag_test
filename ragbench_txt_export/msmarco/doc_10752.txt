Bewley is a surname originating in England around the 13th century. It is said to come from France from the spelling Beaulieu. The story of the family has been told by one of his distinguished descendants, Sir Edmund Thomas Bewley (1837-1908) Q.C., J.P., of Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, Ireland, in his book The Bewleys of Cumberland, published in 1904 (Download Bewleys of Cumberland).
