For example, if your car requires stripping the old layer, removing dents and then repainting the car, then the cost of repainting will be between $1,500-$4,500. In general, it can cost anywhere from $3,000 to as much as $10,000 or more to repaint a vehicle from a garage. If your entire vehicle needs only a simple tire removal, masking and spray paint, you will find that the job will cost between $400- $500, plus tax, if your state charges a service tax. The cost to repaint a car depends on other factors, such as repair work. If your car is in a condition where the mechanic needs to work on the body to bring it back to good condition, it could raise the cost of the repainting significantly
