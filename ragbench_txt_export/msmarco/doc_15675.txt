Reply. When we bought ours the house was empty, we weren't in a chain, neither were they and it took 5 weeks from offer accepted to the keys being in our hands. I think that's reasonably quick though, plus I was on holiday for the summer so spent the time phoning solicitors/mortgage company etc. Put an offer in, accepted and mortgage talks are underway.... we are not in a chain, neither are the other end....so roughly when would one be ready to move into their new place?? magicbeans3y, 9m agoPosted 3 years, 9 months ago.
