A Doctor of Chiropractic degree is required to work as chiropractor. However, candidates usually must first complete at least 90 credits of undergraduate coursework. Some states do not require a bachelor's degree to become licensed as a chiropractor, so individuals should check with the state board they wish to practice in.
