It is a huge and very powerful beast. The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). Thus, the liger has parents of the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid tigon. While the Siberian tiger is the largest pure sub-species, ligers are believed to be the largest of all known extant felines. Ligers exist only in captivity or zoos because the habitats of the parental species do not overlap in the wild. Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching 363 kg (800 lb).
