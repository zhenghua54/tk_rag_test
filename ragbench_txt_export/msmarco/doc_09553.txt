The Kelvin scale begins at absolute zero (-459.67 °F), but because the Kelvin/Celsius degree intervals are larger, eventually the two scales will intersect. This occurs at 574.5875 K or 574.5875 °F, a temperature equal to 301.4375 °C. Calculation The formula T(K) = T(F) as expressed in C(Celsius). The size of a degree on the Kelvin scale is identical to the size of a Celsius degree. So a change (up or down) of 1°C is the same as a change of 1 Kelvin. The size of a Fa … hrenheit degree is much smaller. A change of 1°C (up or down) is the same as a change of 1.8° on the Fahrenheit scale.
