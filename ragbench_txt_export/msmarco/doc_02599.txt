Yesterday I had my 3rd CT Scan in 6 months...a solitary lung nodule grew from 10.9 mm to 11.7 mm to, now, 12.9 mm. This scan showed something new about the nodule, it now has spiculation. My regular doctor, who is not a lung or cancer specialist, is adamant that this is malignant cancer...and the internet says spiculations are almost always a sign of malignancy but so far I've found very little information on it. The nodule is small and the report says no adneopathy, I believe that means it hasn't spread, and it's the only nodule there (other than a 30 year old TB scar). It has irregular boarders and low density.
