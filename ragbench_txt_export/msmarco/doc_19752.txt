Windows. Prep-Just as you did with the doors, make sure the window sashes and trim have been properly prepared before applying any paint. Use a paintable wood filler to fill any dings, dents, or holes in the surface, then sand smooth. If the doors are bare wood then you should first apply an oil-based or latex-based primer made specifically for bare wood prior to painting. Be sure that the gap where any trim touches the walls is caulked with a high quality paintable caulking.
