HABITAT: While black-handed spider monkeys live in Central America from southeast Mexico (Veracruz) to western Panama, Geoffroy’s subspecies is restricted to the mainland of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Spider monkeys make their homes in emergent trees, in the upper levels of tropical and subtropical rain forests. STATUS: Geoffroy’s black-handed spider monkey is currently listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List; mainly due to habitat loss. The L.A. Zoo’s black-handed spider monkeys are part of a Species Survival Plan breeding program to help conserve the species.
