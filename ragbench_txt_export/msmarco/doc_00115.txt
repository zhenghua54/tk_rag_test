In-person interviews should usually be an absolute minimum of 45 minutes and ideally 60 minutes or more, to ensure that you can truly talk in-depth and that the candidate has time to ask their own questions. And that’s assuming that it’s one of multiple meetings in the process. Last week I had a two hour interview – four 30 minute one on ones, one right after the other. It was a little disconcerting, especially in terms of understanding the role of each person that I spoke to, but if I had a question that I forgot to ask I always had another chance and that was nice.
