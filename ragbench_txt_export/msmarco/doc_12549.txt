ANSWER:Unless frozen, shrimp breaks down rather rapidly. If you peel and de-vein, and soak in salted water, you can keep shrimp in a 34.5 degree refrigerator for up to 4 days. â€¦ After that the shrimp will spoil. Making the world better, one answer at a time. Most things frozen can last awhile, but....once you start to see lots of ice crystals on your frozen food, or places on the shrimp that might have dried out with some discoloration then it's probably freezer burnt and been in there too long. A couple months....
