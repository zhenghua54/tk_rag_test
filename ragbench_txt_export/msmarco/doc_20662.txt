One theory behind the correlation between whey protein and weight loss is that protein encourages you to eat less. According to research published in “The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition” in 2008, protein is a more satiating nutrient than either fat or carbohydrate. Since many bodybuilders and weight trainers use whey protein in an effort to add muscle mass, it might come as a surprise that it can also encourage weight loss.
