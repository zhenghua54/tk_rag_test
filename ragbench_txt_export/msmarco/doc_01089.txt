Your minimum monthly payment is based on the type of loan, the amount you owe, the length of your repayment plan and your interest rate. Youâ€™ll typically have 10 to 25 years to repay federal loans entirely. Shorter lengths of time or larger loans will result in higher monthly payments. If you have this type of loan, check with your school to find out when you must begin repayment. The grace period on a private student loan depends on the lender and your loan contract. Most private student loans have a short grace period, but you must check with your lender to make sure. You may also choose to consolidate your student loans during the grace period
