I have rheumatoid arthritis and it has effected my breastbone too. It hurts to breath is because as your lungs expands it puts pressure on your breastbone area. You can also get arthritis in the bones by your collar bone. I started mine when I was 30. What I found the worse was lying down on one of my sides.
