Many of the organs and cavities throughout the body have a lining or membrane surrounding the tissue. The membrane surrounding the lungs is known as the pleura and its job is to support and protect the lung tissue. Pleural thickening of this lining leads to a problem in the functionality of the protective membrane. Even though pleural thickening affects only the lining of the lungs, it can lead to more severe problems. The signs and symptoms associated with the thickening can be from damage to the lining itself or any number of other complications which may have arisen.
