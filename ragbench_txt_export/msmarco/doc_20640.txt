Skeletal muscle is muscle that is used for moving the body. The major skeletal muscle groups forming the upper body are the abdominal, pectoral, deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, biceps, and triceps. The major skeletal muscle groups of the lower body are the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, and gluteus. The first of these groups is collectively known as the abdominal muscles. Abdominal muscles, or abs, are found overtop your stomach. In the diagram below, you'll notice these muscles forming the midsection of the body's front side.
