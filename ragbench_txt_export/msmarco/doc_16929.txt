Best Answer: Per HIPAA, it is 63 days. Depending on the laws in your state, and the type of plan you are going into, HIPAA entitles you to receive credit for prior health coverage as long as the time in between the two policies is not more than 63 days. Update: Yes, health insurance is what I'm referring too. Technically I won't be completely without a way to be covered because you have 60 days to elect cobra coverage which is retroactive if anything happens during May.
