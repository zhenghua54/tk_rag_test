Safflower oil has three qualities that make it a good ingredient for healthy eating: itâ€™s an unsaturated fat, it has little taste, and it can be heated to higher temperatures than many other less healthy cooking oils (in its monounsaturated form). While research is still in its early stages, safflower oil shows a lot of potential when it comes to health benefits. Its healthy fatty acid content may be able to help with cholesterol.
