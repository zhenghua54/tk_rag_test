A Tree's Cambium. The cambium and its zone is a cell generator (reproductive tissue called growth meristem) that produces both the inner bark cells of the phloem and new living wood cells in the xylem. The phloem transports sugars from leaves to roots. The xylem is a transport tissue and both stores starch and conducts water and substances dissolved in water to leaves. A Tree's Inner Bark.
