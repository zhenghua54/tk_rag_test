Boils may take from 1 to 3 weeks to heal. In most cases, a boil will not heal until it opens and drains. This can take up to a week. A carbuncle often requires treatment by your healthcare provider. Depending on the severity of the problem and its treatment, the carbuncle should heal in 2 to 3 weeks after treatment. Your healthcare provider may want to see you for a follow-up visit if he or she prescribes medicine to treat the infection, such as antibiotics, or treats it by opening the boil. 1 Wash your hands and then put a warm, moist cloth on the boil or carbuncle for 10 to 15 minutes at least 3 times a day. 2  This helps the boil come to a head and drain on its own--the safe way to drain.
