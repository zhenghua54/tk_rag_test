The style of Salvador Dali was the most famous and most creative of the twenty-first century because he developed and nourished a style that was insignificant before his time. The dominant themes in his career revolved around his childhood sexual desires and on the study of the unconscious mind. He tried to improve many different styles of art, such as Impressionism, Pointillism, Futurism, Cubism, and Neo-Cubism (Secrest 15). Nevertheless, he sought to fulfill the needs of his mental and social life through a new form of art.
