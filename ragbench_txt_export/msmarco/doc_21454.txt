So what are the average costs of bathroom remodeling? This is a hard question to answer as prices range anywhere from $5,000 up to $30,000 depending on the amount of work and change you want to implement into your bathroom remodeling project. Even with your basic small bathroom, a full bathroom remodel can run to up to $8000 in expenses-this is usually the cost estimated if you're hiring a contractor to do the work for you, which may seem like a lot but in the end it does save you a lot of time and frustration.
