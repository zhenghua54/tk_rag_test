4. PLASTER IS LONG LASTING: The secret to long life of any pool surface is properly maintained water balance. Improper water balance will destroy any pool surface and in many cases, void the warranty of that surface. A plaster surface, in a properly maintained pool, can last 15 to 25 years. The pool plaster industry has come a long way from the white only. Although white plaster is still the most popular, we offer 6 different swimming pool plaster finishes in over 50 different colors. We can also do custom colors, to match other popular pool plaster finishes.
