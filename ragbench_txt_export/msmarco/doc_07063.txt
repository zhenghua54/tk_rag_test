What is Physiotherapy. Physiotherapy is a clinical health science and profession that aims to rehabilitate and improve a personâ€™s ability to move and function. Physiotherapists utilise their expertise in anatomy and physiology to assess and treat people with a variety of health conditions. Paediatric Physiotherapists assess each child individually and develop programmes with a child and family-centred focus. They provide treatment, management and education to enhance the health and wellbeing of children and maximise their participation in everyday activities.
