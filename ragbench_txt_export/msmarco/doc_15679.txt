It's usually the searches that cause it to take about 3 months. jomifl. six weeks shouldn't be a problem, my wife once bought a house in 1 month but the solicitor was a friend of hers. What takes time is finding out if the vendor is the real owner and if there are any debts attached to it. Bought one for cash towards the end of last year, no chain cos they were renting. Told 4 weeks but that was in October and we didn't move in till January. Eve. It can be done very quickly depending on how cautious you want to be (searches etc...).
