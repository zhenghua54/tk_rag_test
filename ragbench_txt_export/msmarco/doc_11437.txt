The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and is widely recognized as the jewel of Muslim art in India. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his favorite wife of three, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for an additional ten years.
