Physical therapist assistants work with physical therapists to help patients with exercises and other therapeutic treatments, such as bathing, applying hot and cold packs, and massaging. Working as a physical therapist assistant is not a stepping-stone on the way to becoming a physical therapist. To become a PT, you’ll need at least a master’s degree.
