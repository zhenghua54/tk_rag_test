No, praying mantis may spit a brown substance around their mouths as a defensive regurgitation like some other insects do, but this secretion is not dangerous to humans. It â€¦ is a myth that they can be harmful to or even kill humans. The Praying Mantis is a carnivorous insect that primarily feeds on other insects, such as Fruit flies, crickets, beetles, moths, or bees. It is not uncommon for larger Mantids to consume small reptiles, birds, and even small mammals.
