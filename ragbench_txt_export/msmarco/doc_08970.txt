As a general rule, arrive at the airport no later than two hours before your domestic flight is scheduled to depart. This is somewhat later than the typical suggestion of three hours for an international flight. Reasons to Arrive Earlier. Consider arriving at the airport more than two hours in advance in some cases. If you do not travel by air frequently and are nervous about the procedures involved, arriving earlier can help ease your mind and give you extra time.
