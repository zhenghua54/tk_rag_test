Passive fire protection materials insulate steel structures from the effects of the high temperatures that may be generated in fire. They can be divided into two types, non-reactive, of which the most common types are boards and sprays, and reactive, of which thin film intumescent coatings are the most common example. [top] Partial protection. Standard fire tests have shown that structural members which are designed to not be fully exposed to fire can exhibit substantial levels of fire resistance without applied protection. Methods have been developed using this effect to achieve 30 and 60 minutes fire resistance.
