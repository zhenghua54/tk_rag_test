Mosquitoes are members of the insect order Diptera along with flies and gnats. In fact, the name mosquito comes from the Spanish word that means small fly. Most people recognize how bothersome mosquitoes can be when they are buzzing and biting. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus from birds to people and horses. Adult mosquitoes are slender, long-legged insects. They have round heads and long, slender wings. When they are resting, the wings lie flat on the insectâ€™s back. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on honeydew, nectar, and plant juices.
