Some marble also forms by contact metamorphism when a hot magma body heats adjacent limestone or dolostone. Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris. During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes. In the early stages of the limestone-to-marble transformation the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.
