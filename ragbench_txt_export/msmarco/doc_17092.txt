Hypocalcemia is an electrolyte imbalance and is indicated by a low level of calcium in the blood. The normal adult value for calcium is 4.5-5.5 mEq/L. Calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth, as well as for normal muscle and nerve function. Normal blood calcium levels are maintained through the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH), your kidneys and intestines. If your blood test results show hypocalcemia, your doctor may check your albumin level as well.
