1. Move tassels from right to left in a traditional ceremony. In most traditional graduation ceremonies, all students begin with their tassel on the right side of the cap. After the student receives a diploma, he or she moves the tassel onto the left side. 1  Many schools ask the students to move the tassels in unison, so everyone shares in the moment.
