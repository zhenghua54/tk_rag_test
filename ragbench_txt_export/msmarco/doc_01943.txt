For existing Foxtel customers, the IQ3 costs $125. If you choose to install it yourself, there’s a $25 fee; if a Foxtel technician installs it, that’s $75. (In some locations, you might not have the option of self-installation; Foxtel should advise you of this when you order.) Your existing plan pricing will remain. As ever, what you’ll pay depends on what channels you’ve signed up for, and whether you’ve included additional options such as home broadband, phone calls, or non-cable services like Foxtel Play or Presto. The absolute cheapest new plan you can score that includes IQ3 will cost $450 over 12 months.
