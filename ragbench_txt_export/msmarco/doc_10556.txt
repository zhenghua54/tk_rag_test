The Janjaweed are people descended from ancient nomads and camel herders who moved to the Darfur region of Sudan from Chad. They are of Arab decent unlike the rest of the people from Darfur who are Christian. The Christians are referred to as Africans. Darfur has been Arab since the 13th century. The Africans and the Arabs would always have clashes most of the clashes being in the 1970s and 80s.
