AST is an enzyme found mostly in the liver, red blood cells, heart and other muscles. When liver, red blood cells, heart or muscle cells are injured, they release AST into the blood. In the slowly developing variety of liver disease, chronic hepatitis, AST levels are usually not as high, often less than 4 times the highest normal level. In chronic hepatitis, AST often varies between normal and slightly increased, so doctors might request the test regularly to determine the pattern of change.
