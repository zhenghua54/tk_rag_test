Report Abuse. Getting your wisdom teeth out is actually not a big deal at all. I got mine removed last year and they give you painkillers so you're not in too much pain. You are also not out for that long, I left the doctor's office about an hour and a half after I came in. Before your wisdom tooth is extracted, the tooth and the surrounding tissue will be numbed with a local anesthetic â€“ the same injection with the same medication you would receive to numb a tooth prior to having a cavity filled.
