This epithelium is found in certain locations within the body. These include the linings of the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities. Other places simple squamous epithelium can be found include; the glomerulus of the kidney, the walls of capillaries, and the alveoli of the lungs. Here they are forming a thin sheet-like layer which allows for minimal resistance to diffusion. They allow the lungs to diffuse oxygen and carbon dioxide quite easily.
