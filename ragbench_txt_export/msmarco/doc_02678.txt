The body cavity search is frequently used as a joke in comedies such as the movie Beavis and Butt-head Do America and Seinfeld. This is due to its humiliating, uncomfortable, and invasive nature. Generally, it adds to the suffering of a comedic foil. In a thorough visual body cavity search, a flashlight is used to illuminate body orifices, including nostrils, ears, mouth, navel, penis (urethra and foreskin) or vagina, and rectum. Generally, the detainee is required to manipulate these body parts so that they can be examined.
