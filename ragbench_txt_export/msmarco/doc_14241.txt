Built-In Colormap Functions. To use a built-in colormap with a specific number of colors, specify map as one of the built-in colormaps functions and pass it an integer value as an input argument. For example, colormap(parula(12)) uses a map with 12 colors from the parula colormap. Return the colormap values for a specific axes by passing its axes handle to the colormap function. Create a figure with two subplots and return the axes handles, ax1 and ax2. Add a filled contour plot to each axes and use a different colormap for each axes.
