Burial insurance is a basic form of life insurance that is rapidly growing in popularity. Unlike term or whole life insurance policies which can cost thousands of dollars and have stringent qualifications, burial, or funeral, insurance is a form of financial insurance that is both easy to qualify for and affordable. Burial insurance covers the cost of your funeral or cremation once you pass. Many people do not realize that funerals can cost several thousand dollars when all the expenses are added up, and they therefore do not plan to save and leave funds for their family or loved ones to help cover the costs.
