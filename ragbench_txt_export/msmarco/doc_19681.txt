Cartilage is a connective tissue whose cells, called chondrocytes, secrete a very specialized matrix. The basophilia of the matrix is due to the GAGs in its ground substance, specifically hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. Connective tissue is the most diverse of the four tissue types with a wide variety of functions. It ranges in consistency from the gel-like softness of areolar connective tissue to the hardness of bone. Blood is also a connective tissue.
