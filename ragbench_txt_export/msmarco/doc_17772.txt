The generated light energy has a wavelength of approximately 900 nanometers, with a beam divergence of 3 milliradians-equal to a beam width of roughly 0.3 m at 100 m or likewise, 3 ft at 1000 ft. Laser Technology products calculate distance by measuring the time of flight of very short pulses of infrared light.
