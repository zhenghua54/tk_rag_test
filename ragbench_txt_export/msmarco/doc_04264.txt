If you think about a beef T-bone or even more, a porterhouse steak, the tenderloin is the small oval and the loin is the big slab. It is the same with a loin pork chop. I have not seen it referred to as pork loin filet--just boneless pork loin and then pork tenderloin. 1  Reply to Original. 2  Print this page.
