Epiglottitis is a life-threatening condition characterized by inflamed epiglottis tissue. The epiglottis is made of cartilage and is located at the base of the tongue. It helps prevent food from entering your windpipe. The tissue of the epiglottis can swell and block your airway. This requires immediate medical attention. If you suspect that you or your child has epiglottitis, call a doctor or seek emergency medical help immediately.
