Flowers are a part of the most important occasions in our lives. They are conspicuously present on birthdays, funerals, graduation, weddings, etc. forming an integral part of our lives. Some flowers have religious significance too. It is impossible for any person to be completely unaware of flower meanings. However, meanings are associated not only with roses but also with other flowers. Most people do not consider flower meanings before gifting flowers. Similarly, people who receive flowers may not know their meaning and hence miss the underlying message.
