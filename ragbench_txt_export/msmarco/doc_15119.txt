Perimysium. The muscle fibers bound together by the endomysium form a bundle called a fascicle. The fascicles are surrounded by connective tissue containing collagen and elastic fibers that supports the blood vessels and nerves that serve the fibers of the fascicles. This connective tissue is called the perimysium. 3. Epimysium. The thick filaments are linked in the center of the sarcomere by proteins that form the M line. At either end of the sarcomere, the actin filaments are attached to one another by proteins that form the Z line. The Z lines mark the boundaries of each sarcomere
