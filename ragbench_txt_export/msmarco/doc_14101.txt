After the cuts have been made to separate the backstrap from the spine, a cut is made across the backstrap all the way to the ribs near the first cut. From this point, the knife is used around the backstrap to separate it from the ribs. This is done on both sides of the deer and should provide two long cuts of meat. Butter or bacon fat are sometimes used as coatings for lean cuts of meat to prevent overcooking. There are several ways of preparing and cooking venison backstrap. As a general rule, any recipe for beef or pork tenderloin can be used for venison, as long as the cooking times are adjusted for size and fat content.
