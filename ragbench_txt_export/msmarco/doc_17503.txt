The Homestead Act was very important because it made a significant change in settling land further west. In the overpopulated eastern states, the Homestead Act encouraged people to move west and settle the land further west. The eastern states that were overpopulated became less populated because the pioneers left those states so they could have their own land. The Homestead Act was a way for the pioneers to get land. The government said that any U.S. citizen who did not fight against the government could file an application to receive land. A citizen could get up to 160 acres of land, as long as they were 21 years old or older
