Lack of Authority. Clan-culture leaders assume a mentoring role toward employees -- some even compare it to the role of a parent inside a family. The lines of authority are not clearly defined inside a clan-culture business, since decisions are often made independently by employees or by common agreement. Potential for Abuse. A clan culture is open, friendly and arguably more appreciative of its employees than any other. However, this comfortable culture is vulnerable to abuse if employees use its tolerance as an opportunity to relax rather than an opportunity to contribute.
