Included are descriptions, functions, and problems of the major structures of the human eye: conjunctiva, cornea, iris, lens, macula, retina, optic nerve, vitreous, and extraocular muscles. A glossary is included. There also is a test for color deficiency and two short quizzes. The light continues through the vitreous humor, the clear gel that makes up about 80% of the eye s volume, and then, ideally, back to a clear focus on the retina, behind the vitreous. The small central area of the retina is the macula, which provides the best vision of any location in the retina.
