IOP (intraocular pressure): The pressure created by the continual renewal of fluids within the eye. The normal IOP varies among individuals. The intraocular pressure is increased in glaucoma. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, the intraocular pressure rises rapidly because the iris blocks the angle in the front of the eye where the anterior chamber fluid normally drains out.
