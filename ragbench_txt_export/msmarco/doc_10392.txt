Radionuclides used in PET scanning are isotopes with short half–lives, such as carbon-11 (~20 min), nitrogen-13 (~10 min), oxygen-15 (~2 min) and fluorine-18 (~110 min). These radionuclides are added into compounds normally used by the body such as glucose (or variations of glucose), water or ammonia. Such labelled compounds are known as radiotracers. In some situations, the patient is required to breath oxygen gas labelled with oxygen-15. Radioactive isotopes and radioactively labelled molecules are used as tracers to identify abnormal bodily processes. This is possible because some elements tend to concentrate (in compound form) in certain parts of the body – iodine in the thyroid, phosphorus in the bones and potassium in the muscles.
