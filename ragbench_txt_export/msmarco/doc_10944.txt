What to do if your baby doesn't roll over. If your baby hasn't figured out how to flip one way or the other by the time he's about 6 months old, and hasn't moved on to sit and try to scoot and crawl instead, bring it up the next time you talk to his doctor. When do babies roll over? Your baby may be able to kick himself over, from his tummy to his back, as early as age 4 months. It may take him until he's about 5 or 6 months to flip from back to front, though, because he needs stronger neck and arm muscles for that maneuver.
