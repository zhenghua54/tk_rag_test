To qualify for the Earned Income Credit, you also must meet a number of other requirements: You, your spouse if married filing jointly, and any Qualifying Children you claim must each have a valid Social Security Number. You must have earned income (from employment or self-employment). In general, your credit is more valuable if you have one or more Qualifying Children. For 2014, the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit per taxpayer is: 1  $496 with no Qualifying Children. 2  $3,305 with one Qualifying Child.
