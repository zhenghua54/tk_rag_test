1 The price range can jump to $850-$1,125 (around $3.75-$5/square foot) or more for a refinishing specialist to do a customized job on a 225-square-foot vintage wood floor, using multiple coats of chemicals, stains and other finishes to create just the right look. 1 Typically this takes about a day or two, and restores a floor that's in relatively good condition. 2  Expect to pay $340-$900 (about $1.50-$4 a square foot) to completely refinish a 15x15 foot room. 3  That generally includes sanding down to the bare wood and applying at least 2 and sometimes 3 coats of finish.
