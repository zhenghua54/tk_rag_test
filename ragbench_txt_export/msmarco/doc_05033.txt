Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi. 1  Sporangiospores: spores produced by a sporangium in many fungi such as zygomycetes. 2  Zygospores: spores produced by a zygosporangium, characteristic of
