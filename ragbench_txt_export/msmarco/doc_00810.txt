Opt for a surgical path in neuroscience. Neurosurgeons, who perform surgical procedures on the nervous system, earned more than neurologists. A survey by Allied Physicians found that salaries start out at $354,000 a year. With just three years of experience, salaries jumped to $541,000 a year, while the highest reported salary for this occupation was $936,000. Doctors and physicians who study diseases of the nervous system arenâ€™t as well paid as neurologists, neurosurgeons or psychiatrists. Salaries for a neuropathologist can range anywhere from $128,500 to $168,500 a year, but the average was closer to $148,500 as of 2012.
