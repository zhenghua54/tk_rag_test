Cyprus (Greek κύπρος, Turkish Kıbrıs,) is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey. After Sicily and Sardinia, Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. Although the island is geographically in Asia it is politically a European country and is a member of the European Union. Cyprus' main airport is Larnaca International Airport (LCA) and is on the outskirts of Larnaka. The previous main international airport located SW of Nicosia is now located on the Green Line separating the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus-it has been out of use since 1974.
