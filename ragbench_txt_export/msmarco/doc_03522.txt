Tews Falls is in the Spencer Gorge/Webster's Falls Conservation Area. This is another of the many waterfalls found along the Niagara Escarpment, and is one of the highest. Tews Falls is the runner up for The Most Improved Falls of 2003. In July of 2002 it was a thin trickle, barely even worth a picture. But in June of 2003, it was a beauty. Tews Falls can be reached from Webster's falls via a 30 minute hike along the Bruce Trail, or by a 5 minute drive down Harvest Road to the Tews Falls parking area. See Webster Falls for directions. There is a view area at the top of the falls that can be easily reached from the parking area
