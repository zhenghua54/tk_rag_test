(UN/DPI Photo #187250C by Evan Schneider) The Tropical Wet/Dry climate is the driest of the tropical wet climates. Like the monsoon climate, it has a distinct seasonality to its precipitation. However, its wet season is much shorter and receives far less precipitation than the monsoon climate. However, the average annual temperature is similar to that of the other tropical wet climates. Mean monthly temperatures in the Tropical Wet/Dry climate range from 18 o C (64.4 o F) to above 25 o C (77 o F).
