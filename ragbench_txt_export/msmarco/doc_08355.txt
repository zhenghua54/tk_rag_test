Pregnancy and Delayed Menopause. In 2007, six out of every 10,000 live births in the United States were to women age 50 to 54, a 5 percent increase from 2006, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. One group of women are at particular risk from late menopause. These ladies have cumulative risks started with an early start of menstruation, before age 12. They never had a full-term pregnancy despite repeated attempts to conceive using fertility medications, and then they went into menopause late.
