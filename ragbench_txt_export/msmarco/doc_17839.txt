Arthrotomy is a traditional, open surgery in which the doctor has a full view of the elbow joint. Anesthesia is required for this procedure and may be either general or regional. Most people achieve a full recovery in three to six months after the arthrotomy. Physical therapy is a vital component to a complete recovery, helping to strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and regain a normal range of motion for the joint.
