Mouth: This is the first organ that begins the digestion process and it is here that mastication or breaking down of food takes place. The mouth further contains three basic organs-the salivary glands, tongue and the teeth. Liver: The liver is one of the most important organs of the human body. The liver basically performs the task of producing digestive juices, biochemicals and also helps in protein synthesis. Pancreas: The pancreas secretes enzymes into the duodenum which breaks down the fats, carbohydrates and protein.
