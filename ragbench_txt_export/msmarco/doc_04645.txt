A: Atenolol (Tenormin) belongs to a class of medications called beta-blockers. Atenolol is a beta-adrenergic (beta-1 selective) agent that blocks beta receptors on the heart. This action primarily affects the heart by slowing it down and decreasing blood pressure. Atenolol, sold under the brand name Tenormin, is a prescription drug used to treat high blood pressure. It is also used to treat angina and chest pain, and has been shown to improve survival rates after a heart attack by decreasing the severity of the heart attack.
