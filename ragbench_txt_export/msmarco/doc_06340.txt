To become an LPN, you need to complete a training program in practical nursing and pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). The LPN program generally takes around a year to complete. Although most schools won't let you shorten the time you'll need to complete an LPN program, you can use your LPN training as a foundation for registered nurse (RN) training. Generally, you will take courses during the summer that act as a bridge between LPN and RN programs before starting the second year of an RN program in the fall. Some schools will require you to complete up to a year of clinical experience as an LPN before you may enter an accelerated program.
