Yield: 1-2/3 cups. I have a recipe for lemon cream cake that calls for lemon curd filling. Popular in England, lemon curd is a soft custard that's often used as a tart filling. It's made from lemon juice, sugar, eggs and butter. The flavor and texture are similar to lemon meringue pie filling. The simple ingredients are cooked together until they become thickened.
