Education. If you enroll in a full-time licensed practical nurse (LPN) training program, you may be prepared and qualified to take your licensing exam in as little as 9-12 months. These programs are available from many community colleges, vocational schools, and universities, and they may range from 43-78 credit hours. Requirements for admission to an LPN training program vary by state and by school, but you typically must hold a high school diploma or have passed the General Educational Development (GED) exam. State requirements often include a drug test, up-to-date immunizations, and a tuberculosis (TB) screening.
