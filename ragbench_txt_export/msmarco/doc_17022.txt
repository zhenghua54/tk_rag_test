PETG / SpectarÂ® Co-polyester sheet is a thermoplastic sheet used in engineering applications. PETG offers the capability to produce complex shapes, precise details, deep draws and compound curves without worrying about durability. It's easily formed, die-cut and punched. PETG sheet has high stiffness, hardness, and toughness as well as good impact strength. Unstressed PETG exhibits good resistance to dilute aqueous solutions of mineral acids, bases, salts, and soaps. PETG also has good resistance to aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, and a variety of oils.
