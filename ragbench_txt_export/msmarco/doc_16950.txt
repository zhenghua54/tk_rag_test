Adobe PDF options (Acrobat Pro DC). You can resave PDFs as optimized PDFs, using settings in the PDF Optimizer dialog box. The PDF Optimizer lets you change the compatibility version of your PDFs so they can be viewed using older versions of Acrobat DC or Acrobat Reader DC. If you want to use the same settings every time you convert PDFs to a particular format, specify those settings in the Preferences dialog box. In the Convert From PDF panel, select a file format from the list and click Edit Settings.
