How long does the this procedure take? Having served notice under section 21 I anticipate having to submit forms N5B to the court on 18th February How long do they take to grant possession order and tell tenants to get out. After that, assuming the worst, how long to get court bailiffs to evict the tenants. Any advice appreciated. 12-12-2006, 22:06 PM #2.
