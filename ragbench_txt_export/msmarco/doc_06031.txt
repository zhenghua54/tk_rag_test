While Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth of retirement assets, qualified Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free, as long as you hold the Roth for at least five years and are at least age 59 1/2*. Withdrawals may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if distributions are taken prior to age 59 1/2.
