I have yet to work on a building built after 1930 that was lime and sand, all I have seen are cement stucco. Mystic secret revealed ! On most lime and sand stucco houses we work on. the sheathing an d framing lumber is still in good condition AFTER SITTING WITH GAPING HOLES FOR YEARS. Sheathing is good shape on this 1920 wood lath and lime and stucco house that had fallen into disrepair over the years.
