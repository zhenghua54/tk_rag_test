With it being an HOA, you might look elsewhere in the restrictions since many times they have some statement about inkeeping with the architectural character of the neighborhood, region, environment, rural feel, etc.. IMHO, hardiplank is not masonry. Of course that and 75 cents will buy you one crappy cup of coffee! Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. I ask because it is a cementatious fiber board, so it contains cement (masonry), but it looks like wood. And while it lasts longer than wood, especially in humid climates, it doesn't have the longevity of masonry, nor the look, which is the whole purpose of the deed restriction in the first place.
