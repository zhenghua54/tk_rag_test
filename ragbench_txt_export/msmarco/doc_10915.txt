These cheese breads are made with a very flavourful bread dough and filled with a cheese called “Pafitiko” made during the Easter period for flaounes. I tend to use a mix of greek cheeses, along with Halloumi, Anari and 50-60% mild english cheddar. It’s very difficult for me to sit here and convince people to sub some greek cheese for english cheddar because Flaounes are really hard to make.
