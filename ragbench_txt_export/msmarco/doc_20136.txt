The name marble is used in a different way in the dimension stone trade. Any crystalline carbonate rock that has an ability to accept a polish is called marble. The name is sometimes used for other soft rocks such as travertine, verd antique, serpentine and some limestones. Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris. During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes. In the early stages of the limestone-to-marble transformation the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.
