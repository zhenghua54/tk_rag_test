The McDonald brothers opened their first restaurant adjacent to the Monrovia Airport in 1937. It was a tiny octagonal building informally called The Airdrome. That octagonal building was later moved to the San Bernardino location at 1398 North E Street in San Bernardino, California, in 1940. It was the second restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, prior to the involvement of Ray Kroc in the company, and it still has the two original 30-foot (9.1 m)  Golden Arches  and a 60-foot (18 m) animated neon  Speedee  sign that was added in 1959.
