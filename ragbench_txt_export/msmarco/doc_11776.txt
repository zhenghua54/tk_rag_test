A rectal temperature is generally considered to be the most accurate, and the standard for monitoring the core body temperature, but it is generally not recommended for use in patients, due to the risk of rectal perforation and tears with this method. Have a separate thermometer to use for oral than for rectal. Also, if you get a high or low reading, re-take the temperature! It may be correct, but it is best to confirm the temperature if it is unusual, and the doctor will ask you if you did take it again, as sometimes there are errors with thermometers, or technique in taking the temperature.
