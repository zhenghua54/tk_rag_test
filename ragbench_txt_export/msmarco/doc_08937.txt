Plant your germinated seeds in seed cell trays within 12-24 hours of sprouting. Be careful to not allow the seedâ€™s root to grow too long while still in the paper towel, or the root will penetrate the paper and be difficult to manipulate without breakage. Once the root is broken, your seed will no longer be viable.
