N.B. An Air Hostess can EARN MUCH MORE when she is in the Horizontal Position (approx. £1,000+ hour upwards) than she can IF she was in the Vertical Position (approx. £30,000 per annum / per year) ! So it pays much more for an Air Hostess to be FLAT ON HER BACK than it does for her to be STANDING UPRIGHT !
