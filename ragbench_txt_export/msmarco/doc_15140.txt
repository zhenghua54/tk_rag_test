Many bacteria live in your intestines in a parasitic relationship that benefits both you and them. Lactobacillus bacteria belong to a class of bacteria known as lactic acid bacteria. Bifidobacterium produce lactic acid as an end product of fermentation. Lactic acid bacteria ferment foods, which lowers the pH level and prevents harmful bacterial growth. In some cases, such as certain types of yogurt, fermented foods contain live bacteria cultures that might have beneficial intestinal effects.
