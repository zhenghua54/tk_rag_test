The lymphatic system consists of two parts, the primary and secondary organs. The thymus gland (located beneath the breast bone, and functioning at its peak during adolescence) and the bone marrow produce specialized lymphocytesâ€”T-cells and B-cells and dispatching them through the lymph vessels to the secondary organs. So, the bone marrow creates the stem cells which become the cells of the immune system. Lymphocytes are sent from the bone marrow to the thymus gland to mature and are then stored in the secondary organs of the lymph system and in the blood stream.
