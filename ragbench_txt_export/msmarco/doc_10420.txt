Raita is the most commonly used Indian word for savory yogurt-based side dishes. Raitas are made by combining yogurt all kinds of grated, pureed and chopped vegetables. Ingredients other than vegetables-like Boondi (made from gram flour) or chutneys-can also be used to make Raita. Avocado Raita is the Indian version of guacamole and tastes yummy with just about anything you serve it with. Turn up the heat by adding more red chilli powder and chopped green chillies!
