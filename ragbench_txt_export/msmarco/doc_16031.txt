Bauxite is a rock made from laterite soil filtered of solvable content such as silica in wet humid or subtropical environments that include West Indies, Africa, Australia and America. There are little deposits in Europe. An estimated 85percent of bauxite produced globally is used to generate alumina. Alumina is used to refine aluminum metal. An additional 10 percent is used to generate alumina that is used in abrasives, chemicals and refractory items. The other 5 percent is used for making aluminum compounds.
