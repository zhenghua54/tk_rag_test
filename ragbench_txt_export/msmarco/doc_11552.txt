Batiste -- a very soft opaque fabric, plainly woven and lightweight -- most often has fibers of cotton, wool, linen, polyester or a synthetic blend. When batiste is manufactured, it gets no acid wash, so the material is not transparent like voiles or organdy, explains the NY Fashion Center. It has a bit of substance, and may be washed and delicately dried by machine. Delicate but Durable. Batiste is featherweight and it breathes, making it comfortable for baby and children's clothing; it smocks beautifully but is sturdy enough to hold up to a little wear and tear. The fabric has a soft sheen, yet it will hold embroidery and is a good choice for decorative samplers.
