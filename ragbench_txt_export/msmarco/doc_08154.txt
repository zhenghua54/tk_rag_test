Your baby needs lots of sleep. The average newborn sleeps for up to 16 hours a day, although it may not feel like this much to you! At first your baby will need to wake up frequently for feeds, probably every three hours to four hours in the day, with longer spells at night. Find out more about how much sleep your baby needs. If possible, your baby should sleep in the same room as you (Lullaby Trust 2013) for the first six months.
