People who are in love are very fortunate to know the feeling. You know if someone’s in love when they always have a smile on their face when they’re with that one person they truly adore. They forgive and forget things that have happened and are grateful just to have that person in their life. When you know that someone is in love, is when they day dream. They also drop there grades because they pay more attention to some one else in stead of there work. They also stare at the person they like. Or sometimes they miss a lesson for going to sleep during class.
