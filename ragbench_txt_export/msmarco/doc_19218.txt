In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. Jaundice is common in newborns. It occurs when the level of bilirubin (a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood rises. Breastfeeding jaundice is common. It develops in 1 of 6 breastfed infants a few days after birth. It occurs in newborns who do not consume enough breast milk (often because the mother's milk has not yet come in well). Newborns who consume less breast milk have fewer bowel movements and thus eliminate less bilirubin.
