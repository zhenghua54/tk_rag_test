-- Osteoblasts are the immature cells of bone which are responsible for the production and mineralization of bone matrix or osteoid. As new bone is formed, a few of the active osteoblast become trapped in the matrix and eventually become osteocytes. -- Osteocytes are the mature cells of bone. They are found in open spaces in bone called lacunae.
