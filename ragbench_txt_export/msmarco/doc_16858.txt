'Steam' is formed when water Vaporises at its boiling temperature. This is 100Â°C at standard atmospheric pressure (1.0atm). Water will also boil at higher and lower temperatures depending on the surrounding pressure. (Increased pressure, increases boiling point and decreased pressure decreases boiling point). Report Abuse. Tricky question. Water will obviously boil and turn to vapor (steam) at 100 degrees celcius (212 F). But if you heat water to a point below boiling, you can see it giving off steam. The temperature at which that happens is not fixed;it varies with the ambient temperature and humidity.
