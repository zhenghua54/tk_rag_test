Those are drain flies. (Sometimes called moth flies) They look like little brown fruit flies. They're not from your septic, they fly down your drains and breed in the damp mushy gunk that collects inside your pipes. The way to get rid of them is to use a foaming type drain cleaner on any drains you find them around.
