Collagen makes up 75% of our skin. Thus the smooth plump appearance of young healthy skin is due, in large part, to the presence of healthy collagen levels. The breakdown of healthy collagen and the decline in collagen production leads to the development of unwanted wrinkles and the appearance of aged skin. Collagen is the bodyâ€™s major structural protein composed of three protein chains wound together in a tight triple helix. This protein supports tissues and organs and connects these structures to bones.
