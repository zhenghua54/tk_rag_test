Specifically, voltage pertains to an electrical driving force between two points. Voltage has something to do with the electrical paths. In other words, the full amount of energy necessary to cause a minor electrical charge to move to the length of a path is the voltage between the end points of that same path. From the hydraulic analogy, voltage can be also be defined as the measure of an ability to do work. It can also be concluded that the more potential difference the larger the voltage or the ability to do a work will result. Voltage is measured using a device known as voltmeter.
