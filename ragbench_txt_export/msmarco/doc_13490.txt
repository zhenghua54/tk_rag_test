The scale of mineral hardness is referred to as the Mohs scale. They run from 1 which is Talc to 10, which is diamond. The other units are 2: Gypsum, 3: Calcite, 4: Fluorite, 5: Apatite, 6: Feldspar, 7: Quartz, 8: Topaz, and 9: Corundum. The most familiar to most pe â€¦ ople would be the Mohs' scale. It is used to measure the hardness of stone on a non-linear scale from 1 to ten. Talc, the softest, is 1 and the hardest, diamond, is 10. It isn't linear because diamond is actually 42 times harder than talc, not 10 times.
