Data accuracy is one of the components of data quality. It refers to whether the data values stored for an object are the correct values. To be correct, a data values must be the right value and must be represented in a consistent and unambiguous form. For example, my birth date is December 13, 1941. Object-level inaccuracies consist of objects that are missing, have missing parts, or that exist but should not. For example, if a repair is done to a piece of capital equipment and the repair person just failed to complete and submit a record of the action, there would be a missing row or rows in the database.
