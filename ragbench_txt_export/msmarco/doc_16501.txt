If I were to sell them they would have sale prices from a low of $900,000 to a high of $1,5000,000. I am constantly barraged by real estate agents that want to sell these properties for me. The rates they quote me are generally from a low of 4% to a high of 7% On a $900,000 house that is from $36,000 to $42,000. An agent lists a property for sale and the listing contracts stipulates how much commission will be paid when a sale takes place. If the listing agent sells the property, he earns the commission. If another agent sells it, the commission is split between the selling agent and the listing agent.
