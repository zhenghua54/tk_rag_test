Keep in mind that this is a credit, not a deduction, so it lowers your tax bill dollar for dollar. Does the cost of kindergarten count toward the credit? No. The cost of kindergarten and higher grades is considered to be an educational expense, not a child-care expense, so it doesn't qualify for the child-care credit. The cost of day care, preschool, before-and after-school care, day camp, or a nanny or other babysitter can count toward the credit.
