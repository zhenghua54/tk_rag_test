A period T is the time needed for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point. As the frequency of a wave increases, the period of the wave decreases. Frequency and Period are in a reciprocal relationship that can be expressed mathematically as: Period equals the Total time divided by the Number of cycles. 1  Orbital period is the time for something to go round (orbit) something else.
