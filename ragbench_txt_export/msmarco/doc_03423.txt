If you filed a tax return by mail, your refund will be issued within six weeks from the date the return was received by the IRS, whether or not you opted for a paper check or an electronic deposit. All taxpayers can check the status of their refund money via the Internet or by calling a toll-free hotline. Taxpayers must wait at least 72 hours after an electronic tax filing before they can check their refund status. Individuals who have filed via mail will need to wait at least 3 weeks after making in the form.
