Most people who report for jury service are finished in one day, but we cannot predict in advance how long the trials will be for any particular day, so you should be prepared for anything. In addition, the judge may vary daily working hours to accommodate witnesses who have special travel or schedule problems. I've been selected to be a jury for a trial (lucky me) and i want to know how long it usually last for.
