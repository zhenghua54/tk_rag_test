Best Answer: Actually manifold pressure is the Difference between the air pressure (or vacuum) inside the intake manifold and the relative atmospheric pressure of the air around the engine. Without a supercharger or turbocharger, both of which force more air into the intake manifold, the maximum manifold pressure is the ambient pressure around the airplane, with a slight loss due to the throttle plate.
