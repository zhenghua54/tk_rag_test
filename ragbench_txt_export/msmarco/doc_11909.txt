There are 4 valves in the heart: tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic. Regurgitation is also called insufficiency or incompetence. Regurgitation happens when a valve doesn't close properly and blood leaks backward instead of moving in the proper one-way flow. Every time your heart beats, blood flows into, through, and out of your heart. In fact, your heart moves about 100 gallons (379 liters) of blood through your body every hour. Two types of problems can disrupt blood flow though the valves: regurgitation or stenosis.
