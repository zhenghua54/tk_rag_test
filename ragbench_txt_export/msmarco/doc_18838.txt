Infection is infrequent in dogs. Signs of lungworm infection range from moderate, dry coughing with slightly increased respiratory rates to severe, persistent coughing and respiratory distress or even failure. Infections with no visible signs can also occur. Diagnosis of lungworm infection is based on signs, known transmission patterns, and presence of larvae in feces. Examination of the airways with an endoscope (bronchoscopy) and x-rays can be helpful tools.
