It will take 8 weeks for the majority of the injuery to heal but it will take up to a full year to get 100% function back with therapy. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

I sufferered from a dislocated elbow few weeks ago when a long 40 ft, 2 tonne pipe hit my arm. A surgery was required to reduce the elbow and repair the ligaments, I am wondering how long healing takes. Thank you all in advance
