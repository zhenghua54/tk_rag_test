Thornless honey-locust. The light, dappled shade cast by the lacy foliage of this attractive tree is only one of its virtues. It also is durable and adaptable, tolerating a wide range of soil conditions as well as drought, and road salt, and has a lovely yellow fall color. As a result, honey locust is overused in city and suburban landscapes.
