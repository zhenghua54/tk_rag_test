Roasting chicken drumsticks in a convection oven isn't any more difficult than cooking them in a traditional oven, though you will need to use a lower temperature and expect a shorter cooking time. A convection oven is a handy cooking tool to have because it cooks food more quickly than a conventional oven and yields more golden brown and juicy meat, according to the Fine Cooking website.
