Hi i have a 3 year old and I am thinking of putting him into the Montessori school .So couple of questions 1) if the fees is $6500 for half day program at Rotherglen(Mississauga) how much is tax deductible. 2) Can anyone guide me to a good pre school montessori or Co-Op in mississauga. My son is also in a Montessori 5 days a week in the casa program and I did receive a tax receipt from the school. My question is, do I file the receipt under child care expense or under tuition? My understanding is there is a difference in the amount of credit right? Please advise.
