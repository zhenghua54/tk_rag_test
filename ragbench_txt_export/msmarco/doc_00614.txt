If the Borrower is bankrupt or a trustee in bankruptcy has been appointed, you should use Standard document, Contract for the sale of residential freehold property by trustee in bankruptcy (www.practicallaw.com/6-422-4461) . Where title to the Property (or part of it) is unregistered, it may be convenient to annex the epitome of title to the contract (see Annex 3). For a form of epitome that may be used for this purpose, see Standard document, Epitome of title (www.practicallaw.com/5-383-5260) .
