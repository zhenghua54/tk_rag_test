The actual cost of an advertising campaign on Twitter has always been somewhat shrouded in mystery with large campaigns run without direct figures revealed. Well now they have and it’s a huge $120,000 per day to run a Promote Trend on the site. Which, according to Business Insider, is up from the $30,000 per day they cost last year. $5,000 per month on advertising via a relatively new and unproven platform is too much for many small businesses. While the chief of revenue states the minimum ad spend is $15,000 over 3 months, this could change as Twitter has just announced it’s introducing a self-serve ad system by the end of the year.
