In the fall, I buy extraordinary kabocha squash from a farmer at my farmer's market. At his stand he has samples with a big sign advising consumers if you aren't going to eat the skin, keep your hands off the samples. As an aside, you would be amazed by the differences in Kabocha flavor. And you know--he is right. Plus when I make long cooked winter stews of grain and squash, leaving the skin on helps keep more structure in the squash. Now I'm making something with butternut squash. The squashes in my possession are also fully organic.
