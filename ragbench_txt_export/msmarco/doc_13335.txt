Kalocsa. Paprika Day of Kalocsa. Kalocsa is a one thousand-year-old town on the left bank of River Danube. Our first king, Saint Stephen founded the Archbishopric of Kalocsa here. From that time the town became an economic, administrational, ecclesiastic and cultural centre. Nowadays it is famous for its Baroque buildings and monuments, its folk art and red pepper (paprika). The Paprika Days is not only the holiday of visitors coming to Kalocsa but also the holiday of all local families producing it and processors as well as companies that try to do their best to make a reputation of red gold both in Hungary and abroad. The Hungarians sit to the table whenever they are happy or sad.
