DNA is deoxyribose. The four nitrogen bases are the same for all organisms. The. sequence and number of bases is what creates diversity. DNA does not. actually make the organism, it only makes proteins. The DNA is transcribed. into mRNA and mRNA is translated into protein, and the protein then forms the. organism.
