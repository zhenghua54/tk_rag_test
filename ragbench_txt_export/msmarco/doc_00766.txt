ScienceDirect is the search interface for journals and books from Elsevier, one of the world's premier publishers in science, technology, and medicine. We have many current journals in ScienceDirect (back to 1995), a few back files (up to 1995), and a few books. An advanced search, with more search options is available from the Search button. In the All Sources tab, you can search within journals, books, and databases, whether or not we have full text access. The default search will search all journals and books in the database (see the check boxes under the search boxes).
