Pleural thickening can cause shortness of breath and adversely affect the lungs' ability to function properly. It is not malignant and is not necessarily a sign of asbestos lung disease; in this sense, pleural thickening is not as serious as asbestosis or malignant mesothelioma. Pleural thickening can occur as a result of any inflammation occurring in the lungs. In addition to asbestos exposure, this may stem from any of the following: 1  Bacterial pneumonia. 2  Pleural effusion (excessive fluid in the pleural space). 3  Infection. 4  Tuberculosis. 5  Tumors (both benign and malignant). 6  Rheumatoid lung disease
