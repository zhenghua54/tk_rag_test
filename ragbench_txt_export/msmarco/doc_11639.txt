As a result, the plants release water vapor which condenses and falls as precipitation. On average, a tropical rainforest is about 80°F (26°C) and has little daily or seasonal variation in temperature. In addition, tropical rainforests have an average of 100 inches (254 cm) of precipitation annually. The majority are found in Central and South America, but tropical rainforests also exist in Southeast Asia, eastern Australia, and central Africa (map of locations) . The largest in tact tropical rainforest in the world is in the Amazon River Basin. Tropical rainforests form in these locations because they are within the ITCZ, which provides the warm temperatures common in the forests. Due to the temperatures and plant growth, transpiration rates are high
