But the average age of a vehicle on the road is 10.8 years (up from 8.4 in 1995), which means the vast majority of cars and trucks don't have this feature. If you plan to keep your older car but still want the peace of mind that comes with a backup camera, it's not too difficult to install one yourself. Backup cameras are a nearly universal option on new cars and will likely be mandated for all cars by 2014. And for good reason: The compact cameras provide a view of what's behind the car, reducing the chance of backing over a bicycle or, worse, the kid riding it.
