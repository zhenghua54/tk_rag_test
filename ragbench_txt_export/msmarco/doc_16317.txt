If you win, the court can order the losing side to pay your court fees and costs BUT if you filed a limited civil case when you could have filed in small claims court, the judge can decide not to order the losing side to pay for fees and costs. 1 For example, in a dispute over whether or not you owe someone money, you can sue in small claims to recover money you paid under protest (which means you have to pay the amount and then go to court to ask for it back). 2  But you cannot sue to get the court to decide whether or not you owe money before you pay it.
