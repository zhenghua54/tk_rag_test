Dielectric grease is a special type of grease which is most commonly used for lubricating purposes. Dielectric grease is neutral in nature. It resists corrosion to a certain extent. It acts by restricting the entry of water and other agents into the electrical connector. It resembles the petroleum jelly Vaseline in general appearance. It acts as a block between the surfaces. Dielectric grease also prevents condensation. The use of dielectric grease should be avoided in heavy bearings. The advantage of using this grease is that it provides lubrication without conducting electricity. Dielectric grease is grey in color and insoluble in water.
