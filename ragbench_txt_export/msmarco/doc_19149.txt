Asker's rating. Report Abuse. Marginalization is the social process of becoming or being made marginal (to relegate or confine to a lower social standing or outer limit or edge, as of social standing); the marginalization of the underclass; marginalization of literature and many other are some examples. Marginalization involves people being denied degrees of power. Marginalization has the potential to result in severe material deprivation, and in its most extreme form can exterminate groups.. To dumb it down, marginalization is basically being treated like a 3rd class citizen.
