The TCM also compares the input speed signal and the engine speed signal to determine the following: Sensor failure: Failure of the Transmission Input Shaft Speed Sensor and/or the Output Shaft Speed Sensors are somewhat common on early model WJ Grand Cherokees. The 45RFE / 545RFE transmissions use two sensors, an input speed sensor and an output speed sensor. Both are the same part number. Operation: The Input Speed Sensor provides information on how fast the input shaft is rotating.
