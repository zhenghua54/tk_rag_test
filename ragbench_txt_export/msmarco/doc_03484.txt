Every road transport undertaking must hold an Operator Licence in order to operate for hire or reward, and one of the conditions of the licence is that the operator must have a qualified transport manager, i.e. a person who holds a CPC. Operator Licences are issued by Road Transport Operator Licensing Unit. You will need to make an application for a new licence in the name of the limited company or partnership and return the sole trader licence documents to Road Transport Operator Licensing Unit. The same requirements apply when changing from a limited company or partnership to a sole trader.
