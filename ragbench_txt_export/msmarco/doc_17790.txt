Patience Pays Off. Your lawnmower, especially if it's equipped with a grass catcher, acts like a vacuum and sucks up the fertilizer before it can dissolve into the soil if you mow too soon. Waiting 24 to 48 hours allows most of the nutrients to soak into the soil. Mowing before you fertilize removes excessive growth and debris, like fallen leaves, so the fertilizer can reach the soil more quickly. Lawn fertilizers are usually applied to dry grass, unless the fertilizer also contains an herbicide.
