Marketing managers made salaries ranging from about $58,000 to $166,000 per year in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This wide range reflects the pay earned by all marketing managers, regardless of education level. Those with a master's degree are more likely to make the median salary or higher.

Factors such as where the marketing MBA graduate received his education can have an influence on how much he is paid.
