Nausea. Nausea can be another early indicator of pregnancy. The majority of pregnant women do not complain of morning sickness until the 6th week of pregnancy, 2 weeks after a missed period. But for some women, that nagging feeling can start as early as one week after conception, a full week before a missed period. But some women experience pregnancy symptoms days before their period is due. As a result of the shift in hormones, tiny changes take place in the body that alert the woman that she may be pregnant even before a positive pregnancy test.
