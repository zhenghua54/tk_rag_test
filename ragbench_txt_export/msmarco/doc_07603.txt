1 On average, a money order will cost anywhere from $0.70 to as much as $10 if you choose to go to a bank. 2  If you bypass the banks, however, you should only have to budget anywhere from $1 to $3. 3  For example, Walmart.com claims that a standard money order can cost $0.70. 1 Single money orders will have a maximum limit that is usually around $1,000. 2  So if you had to purchase $1,500 worth of money orders, you would have to purchase two separate money orders, which means you will have to pay for each one. 3  International money orders can cost $3 to $6.
