The shape of the pulse wave is defined by its duty cycle D, which is the ratio between the pulse duration () and the period (T). A pulse wave or pulse train is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform that is similar to a square wave, but does not have the symmetrical shape associated with a perfect square wave. It is a term common to synthesizer programming, and is a typical waveform available on many synthesizers.
