Sport psychology is an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from many related fields including biomechanics, physiology, kinesiology and psychology. It involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affect psychological and physical factors. In its formation, sport psychology was primarily the domain of physical educators, not researchers, which can explain the lack of a consistent history.
