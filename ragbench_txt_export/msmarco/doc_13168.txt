A deliverable is an outcome that a project team must produce and present to the customer in accordance with the terms of a contract for a project to be complete. Project leadership can present one or more deliverables to the customer during the term of the project or just prior to its completion. The project scope statement describes each deliverable and the related acceptance criteria.
