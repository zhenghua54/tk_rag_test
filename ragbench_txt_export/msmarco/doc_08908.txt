In short, the term “good governance” has become a catchy shorthand way to describe a variety of political and economic institutions and outcomes. While it thus is likely to remain in common public usage, as is, it is not a useful concept for development analysts and policymakers. Good governance as a concept. In general, work by the World Bank and other multilateral development banks on good governance addresses economic institutions and public sector management, including transparency and accountability, regulatory reform, and public sector skills and leadership.
