See vaccine information statements (VIS). The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccine is highly effective in preventing tetanus in young children. DTaP shots are recommended for babies at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, and again at 15 through 18 months of age. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for all 11 through 18 year olds, preferably at age 11 or 12 years. After getting the Tdap vaccine as a preteen or teen, adults need to get a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to stay protected.
