Snail Habitat. Snails are quite plentiful in the world so it shouldn’t come as a surprise to learn they are found in very diverse habitats. Some of them are comfortable in the desert while others live in ditches and cooler climates. These include the mountain areas and even in marshes. Of course a snail can’t move very far in a day but they do continually move most of the time to new locations. Snails are loners but they often come into contact with each other due to the feeding grounds where they find plenty for all of them to share. This is also where they find each other for mating to occur
