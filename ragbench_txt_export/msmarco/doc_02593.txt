A spiculated mass is any lump of tissue with spikes or points on the surface. I don't think it's necessarily a type a cancer. Even non-cancerous lumps can be spiculated. I believe the word just refers to the shape of the tissue mass. Spiculated masses are star shaped, as opposed to round and smooth. In cancer, a spiculated mass is a lump of tissue with spikes or points on the surface. Spiculation measures is an important strategy in the detection of breast cancer with CAD (computer aided detection) http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/db_alpha... http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/conten...
