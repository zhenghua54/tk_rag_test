The theory An acid is an electron pair acceptor. A base is an electron pair donor. The relationship between the Lewis theory and the Bronsted-Lowry theory Lewis bases It is easiest to see the relationship by looking at exactly what Bronsted-Lowry bases do when they accept hydrogen ions. The Bronsted-Lowry theory says that they are acting as bases because they are combining with hydrogen ions. The reason they are combining with hydrogen ions is that they have lone pairs of electrons-which is what the Lewis theory says. The two are entirely consistent.
