The history of sourdough is as old as the history of leavened bread itself. Way back in ancient days (around 6,000 years ago, some say) humans first figured out how to promote the fermentation and leavening of grains to first be brewed into beverages and then, later, to be baked into bread. Sourdough Bread: Bread which has been leavened with a sourdough starter. It may or may not be a sour bread, depending on the characteristics of the starter. Sourdough: An American term for a natural leaven of wild or natural yeast and lactobacilli. Also the process of leavening bread with a natural leaven.
