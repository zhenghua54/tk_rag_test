1 When a different artist records a new version of a song it is called a cover. 2  It is possible (and not uncommon) for a song to be both a cover and a crossover. 3  This phenomenon was less common in the years from 1950 to 1953. 4  Only about 10% of songs crossed over from one chart to another chart.
