Functional Properties of Sugar. It is common for individuals to associate sugar (sucrose) with its inherent taste properties. Aside from providing a sweet taste and flavour, sugar imparts numerous functional properties that make it an important ingredient in many foods. Specific functional properties of sugar can be classified into four broad categories: sensory, physical, microbial and chemical. Solubility-Sugar is very soluble in water. The ability to produce solutions of varying sugar concentrations is important in many food applications. A high level of solubility, for example, is essential in beverages to provide sweetness and to increase viscosity to create a desirable â€˜mouthfeel'.
