Kingdom Plantae consist of living multicellular organisms and are also known as green plants. They form a group that includes plants of different varieties like the flowering plants, confers, gymnosperms, ferns, mosses, liverworts, and also green algae etc. Plants are present on land, in fresh and marine waters. Plantae is the group where living organisms other than animals are traditionally divided into. This division dates back to Aristotle who distinguished plants to be organisms which do not move. Later, Linnaeus proposed the the basis of modern classification, the division was of two groups Plantae and Animalia.
