Edwards syndrome (also known as trisomy 18 [ T18 ]) is a chromosomal abnormality caused by the presence of all, or part of, an extra 18th chromosome. This genetic condition almost always results from nondisjunction during meiosis. It is the second-most common autosomal trisomy, after Down syndrome, that carries to term. Edwards syndrome occurs in around one in 6,000 live births, and around 80% of those affected are female. The majority of fetuses with the syndrome die before birth. The incidence increases as the mother's age increases.
