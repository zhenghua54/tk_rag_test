Here are some numbers you can use for your pond or lake project. To move or excavate dirt to build or dig a pond, you can expect to pay roughly $2.50 per cubic yard of material dug out of the pond. Figure $1.50 - 3.50 per yard of material depending on the difficulty of excavation and costs specific to local market conditions. A pond is very much more than a hole in the ground that collects water. After calculating a rough pond excavation budget, now double the pond construction budget due to the cost of dredging and re-digging the pond in ten to twenty years or sooner due to a poor pond design.
