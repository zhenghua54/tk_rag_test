Understand the different ways you can find out how much you owe the IRS if you are unsure. Many people who haven't paid attention to IRS CP Letters, or have moved, may be unsure. The first step to find the right tax resolution is to know how much you owe before you can begin to resolve major tax problems. Finding out how much you owe can be done in a few ways: 1) You can show up at your local IRS office or you can give the IRS a call. You can use IRS.gov to find out where your closest IRS office is or just call the national 1-800 number which is 1-800-829-1040.
