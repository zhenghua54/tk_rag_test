Seed plants or seed-bearing plants, also called spermatophytes or Spermatophyta, are vascular plants with numerous members belonging to the lignophytes or woody plants. They have the natural ability to produce seeds, a characteristic which likewise distinguishes them from earlier plants. Similar to bryophytes and the ferns and allies, the gymnosperms have no flowers. They are also described as plants with naked seeds because during pollination the ovule is not enclosed by the carpel except some kind of scales during development.
