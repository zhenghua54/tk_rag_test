Yes, mortgage loan origination fees are tax deductible in most cases. There are some rules, though, in applying tax deduction. To itemize deductions, it is recommended you use the services of a certified accountant. If loan origination points were high but you didn't pay other closing costs (e.g. escrow account setup fee, home appraisal and attorney fees, etc.), the loan origination fee is not tax deductible.
