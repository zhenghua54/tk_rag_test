The manifold pressure gauge is an engine instrument typically used in piston aircraft engines to measure the pressure inside the induction system of an engine. In other words, it literally reads the pressure inside the induction system. In normally aspirated engines (non turbo-charged), the manifold pressure gauge has a range of anwhere between 10 â€“ 40 in. hg (or inches of mercury). In a turbocharged engine, the manifold pressure is allowed to go as high as the engine manufacturer allows.
