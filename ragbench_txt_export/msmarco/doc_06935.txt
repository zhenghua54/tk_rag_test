Antibodies Defined. Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system to help stop harm from occurring. They are also called immunoglobulins. When an intruder, such as a virus, bacteria, or other chemical, enters the body, the immune system springs into action. These invaders, antigens, are met by the B cells (a type of white blood cell from the immune system). These B cells will begin to create Y-shaped proteins called antibodies that begin the process to destroy the antigen and to protect the body from harm and infection.
