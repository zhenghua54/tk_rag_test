Char Wallah shop is situated at Unit 14, The Pavilions, High Street, Birmingham. The shop has been designed and refurbished by Andrew and Julie and has a lovely ambience. You can have a 'taster' of any tea before purchasing or you go, sit back, and relax with a pot of tea and soak up the atmosphere. Accessories are available in the shop to purchase to enable you to enjoy the experience of drinking loose leaf tea at home or at work.
