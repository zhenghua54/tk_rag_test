Chapter 1 Theoretical Introduction † Factor analysis is a collection of methods used to examine how underlying constructs in°uence theresponses on a number of measured variables. † There are basically two types of factor analysis: exploratory and conﬂrmatory. – Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) attempts to discover the nature of the constructs in°uencinga set of responses. – Conﬂrmatory factor analysis (CFA) tests whether a speciﬂed set of constructs is in°uencing re-sponses in a predicted way. 2.3 Factor Analysis vs. Principal Component Analysis † Exploratory factor analysis is often confused with principal component analysis (PCA), a similarstatistical procedure. However, there are signiﬂcant diﬁerences between the two: EFA and PCAwill provide somewhat diﬁerent results when applied to the same data.
