Oral (by mouth) is the most common method of taking a temperature. For you to get an accurate reading, the person must be able to breathe through his or her nose. If this is not possible, use the rectum, ear, or armpit to take the temperature. 1  Place the thermometer under the tongue, just to one side of the center.
