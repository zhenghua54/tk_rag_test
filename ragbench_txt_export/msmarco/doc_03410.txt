In recent years another solution has appeared. Medical tourism has people living in one country and traveling to another to seek medical, dental and surgical care. With the globalization of factories, farming and finance, it is inevitable that yet another major industry like healthcare would join the ranks. There is now even a trade association – The Medical Tourism Association – with its own website. There are success stories, ads for guide books, and an upcoming industry events listing. Separate sections offer material for healthcare providers, governments, insurers, and patients.
