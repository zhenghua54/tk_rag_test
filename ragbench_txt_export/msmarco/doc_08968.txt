All air travelers must arrive at the airport well in advance of their international flights. They'll need time to check baggage and might need to check in for the flight. Each airport's wait times at the check-in counter, baggage check and TSA checkpoint vary, which affects the recommended arrival time. International airports, such as the Orlando International Airport, suggest arriving three hours before flight departure for international travel.
