What's important in evaluating healing time (and thoroughness of healing) is that wounds heal across the gap. They don't heal length-wise. A 1-inch wound whose edges are separated by a 2mm gap will heal no faster than a 5-inch wound separated by a 2mm gap. Thus, if your gums are cut but the wound edges are approximated fairly well, you can expect them to heal rapidly. Generally by 2 weeks time you won't even know that a cut was made there. If it is a surgically created clean cut then it will heal very fast and nicely. It it is a tear it will take some time to heal and will leave a scar. Generally speaking oral mucosa heals very fast, rinsing with warm saline aids healing. m_a_fouda Â· 9 years ago. Thumbs up.
