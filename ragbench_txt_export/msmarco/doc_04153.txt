Freud calls this translation of latent dream-thoughts into the manifest dream the dream work.. The two main ways that repression re-works the primitive impulses of the latent dream-thoughts is by way of condensation (1) or displacement (2). The job of dream interpretation is to translate the manifest dream back into its constituent, if buried, dream-thoughts. The interpretation of symptomsfollows a similar path; the goal is to determine the repressed sexual desires or traumatic events that are causing the abnormal behavior to occur.
