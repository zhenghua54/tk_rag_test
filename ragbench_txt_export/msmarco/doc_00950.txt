Some simpler plants, like m â€¦ oss and ferns, are nonvascular. In plants, a vascular system is analogous to the heart, veins and arteries of an animal (which is why it's called a cardiovascular system). It is a system of tubes that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. Phloem tissue carries sugar from the leaves to other cells of the plants. Non vascular plants are plants that lack tissues that transport water, nutrients, and sugar. Some example of non vascular plants are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
