Typography was the art of designing, setting and arranging type whereas typesetting was the process (or craft) of actually setting the type. Note the class difference: typography wore a beret and twirled a designerâ€™s pen, typesetting wore an apron, punched type and had ink on its fingers. In essence, then, when laying out your book, your typesetter will be concerned to: 1  Fit your text and illustrations into the agreed page extent. 2  Place text and illustrations in an effective and appropriate combination.
