Chios Mastic Mastiha (Greek: μαστίχα) is a resin obtained from the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus). In pharmacies and nature shops, it is called Arabic gum (not to be confused with gum arabic) and  Yemen gum . The rarity of mastic and the difficulty of its production make it expensive. As a result, imitations in the form of other resins appear in the market, sold as mastic, such as Boswellia or gum arabic. Other trees, such as Pistacia palaestina, can also produce a resin similar to mastic.
