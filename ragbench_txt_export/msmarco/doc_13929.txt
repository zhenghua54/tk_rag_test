Nitrobenzene to phenylamine The conversion is done in two main stages: Stage 1: conversion of nitrobenzene into phenylammonium ions Nitrobenzene is reduced to phenylammonium ions using a mixture of tin and concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is heated under reflux in a boiling water bath for about half an hour. The benzene is first converted to nitrobenzene which is in turn reduced to phenylamine. Benzene to nitrobenzene Benzene is nitrated by replacing one of the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring by a nitro group, NO2.
