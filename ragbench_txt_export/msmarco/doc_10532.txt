The River Shannon (Irish: Abha na Sionainne / an tSionainn / an tSionna) is the longest river in Ireland at 360.5 km (224 miles). The River Shannon drains the Shannon River Basin which has an area of 16,865 km 2 (6,512 ml 2), one fifth of the area of Ireland. Limerick is the end point of the river, where it flows into the Shannon Estuary. Though the Shannon has always been important for navigation in Ireland, there is a fall of only 18 m (60 ft) in the first 250 Km (140 miles).
