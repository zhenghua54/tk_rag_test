The National Pork Board suggests cooking to a final internal temperature of 160F degrees, which can be achieved by cooking to 155F degrees and removing the tenderloin from the oven to rest 10 minutes (the temperature will rise several degrees). If youâ€™re using a glaze, apply it now. Place skillet in the oven and roast 15 to 20 minutes, until internal temperature is 145F degrees. Remove from the oven, tent the pork with foil and let it rest about 5 minutes before serving.
