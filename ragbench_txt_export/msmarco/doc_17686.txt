In anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis antibodies are generated against NMDA receptors and go on to attack these receptors where they are found in their highest concentration: within the brain. The reasons why anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are formed is not yet fully understood. What is known is that most tumours associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis contain neural tissue (tissue containing cells identical to that found in the brain), and NMDA receptors.
