The sciatic nerve is actually made up of five nerves. It is formed on the right and left hand side of the lower spine by the combination of the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves and the first three nerves in the sacral spine. 1  See also Spinal Anatomy and Back Pain. In the lower thigh/above the back of the knee, the sciatic nerve divides into two nerves, the tibial and peroneal nerves, which innervate different parts of the lower leg: 1  Peroneal nerves. 2  Tibial nerves.
