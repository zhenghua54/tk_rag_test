This all started when a reader from northern Michigan asked what herbs were perennial in her climate. She already had chives, lavender and parsley (which I grow like an annual even though it is a biennial). OK, Janice from northern Michigan here is a list, not the list, just a list. I think you are in Zone 4a or b or you can pinpoint it better with an e-mail to me. This list is in no particular order.
