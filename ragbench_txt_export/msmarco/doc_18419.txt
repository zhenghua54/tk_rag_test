Lumber (American English; timber in Australian English, British English, Hiberno-English, and New Zealand English) is wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber may be supplied either rough-sawn, or surfaced on one or more of its faces. In the United Kingdom, the word lumber is rarely used in relation to wood, and timber is almost universally used in its place; but lumber has several other meanings in Britain, including unused or unwanted items.
