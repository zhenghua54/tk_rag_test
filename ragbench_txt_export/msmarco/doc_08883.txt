A Dr. Akash Bajaj, MD, Anesthesiology, answered. Finding the cause of knee and hip pain can be a difficult task. Your doctor will use information about your symptoms, examination, imaging studies and other tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. The knee joint is the connection between the thigh and the leg. It is important to make an accurate diagnosis of the cause of your symptoms so that appropriate treatment can be directed at the underlying problem. If you have hip pain, some common causes include: arthritis and bursitis.
