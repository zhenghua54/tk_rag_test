One of the three nutrients essential to healthy plant growth, phosphate can be applied in a high concentration with a superphosphate fertilizer to plants ranging from houseplants to agricultural crops. Several different types of this fertilizer have been created for different needs. All three types of superphosphate are usually made with a naturally occurring substance called rock phosphate.
