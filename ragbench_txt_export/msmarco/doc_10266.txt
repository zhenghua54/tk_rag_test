The Puritans left England in order to worship God in the way they believed was right. They founded three colonies in the New England, Plymouth in 1620 and Massachusetts Bay Co â€¦ lony in 1630, both located in Massachusetts, and the Connecticut Colony in 1636. Some people say they came because they wanted religious freedom, but that's not really correct, because they believed their way of worship was the only right way and did not allow people who believed something different to worship as they saw fit. The Puritans settled only in the New England region.
