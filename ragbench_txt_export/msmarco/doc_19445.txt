I use frozen chicken breast. Cook them on low for about 5 hours... sometimes more, depending on work. I make a sauce that is flavorful and delicious. I take about 1 c. of orange juice, 1/2 can of chipotle chili (whole then puree it with all the ingredients.), about 1-3 T. of lemon or lime juice. pour 1/4 cup of Chicken broth over the breasts In a seperate bowl combine 1 box of Chicken Stuffing mix with 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup. Pour this mixture over chicken breasts. Put the lid on and cook for 6-8 hours on low. The stuffing comes out awesome and the chicken stays moist!
