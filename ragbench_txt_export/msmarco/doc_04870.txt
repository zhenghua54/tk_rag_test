And, of course, you might be keen to find out if that creepy guy in the lunch queue at work is cyber-stalking you. Bad news, I'm afraid. There is *no* way that you can find out who has been looking at your Facebook profile. The only people who might have the data is Facebook itself, and it doesn't seem interested in providing the functionality. So anything which claims to offer you a way to find out who has been peeking at your profile, is almost certainly a scam. Proceed with caution and be careful not to be duped into clicking on any links, or completing any surveys to get some magic Facebook power.
