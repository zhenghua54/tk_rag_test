11Chapter 1 Characteristics of chemical messengers Hormones are chemical messengers Hormones are signalling molecules synthesized within the body that regulate andcoordinate physiological and metabolic functions by acting on receptors located on or intarget cells.

Sometimes the signalling moleculesare released by the cell into the interstitial fluid space to act on the receptors of the cellthat produced them.
