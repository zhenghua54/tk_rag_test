Breaking a complex or long-duration project down into individual Contract Deliverables protects the Customer by allowing quick identification of problem areas as the project advances, and allows follow-on initiatives to be linked to the accomplishment of prerequisite Deliverables. The deliverables are the specific items that must be delivered to the client, at a specified date, meeting the criteria defined in the contract. The details of the deliverables are usually very carefully spelled out in the contract. If they are not-get specific definitions before you get involved. Jim Â· 10 years ago.
