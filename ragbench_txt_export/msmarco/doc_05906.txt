Most strawberry lovers know that a serving contains a lot of vitamin C. In fact, one cup of strawberries (about eight medium-sized berries) yields 150 percent daily value (DV) of vitamin C. Talk about nutrient density! Thatâ€™s a lot of vitamin C for only 50 calories. Strawberries are also relatively high in fiber.
