A cDNA sequence is derived from the transcript by reverse transcription and will, therefore, also contain the 5' and 3' UTRs. For example, see this schematic diagram of an unspliced transcript: The CDS of the gene depicted in image above will only contain the ATG, the STOP and the two green regions (exons). The cDNA will contain all that and, in addition, the two UTRs. Of course, both the cDNA and the CDS will not contain the introns.
