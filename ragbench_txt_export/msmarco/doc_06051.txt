If the payer pays $70 in cash (or has an equivalent amount credited as a non-agency payment under s71 or s71A) by the due date for August 2013 (7 September 2013) then $30 from the $2,000 uncredited amount is credited. The arrears of $3,000 remain. The uncredited amount is reduced to $1,970. F and M agree to have the payment applied at the rate of 50% of the ongoing liability, and payer F will pay the other 50% of the ongoing liability, so that M will still receive 50% of her child support as periodic payments.
