In a food chain, they are called the “ primary consumers ”. This is because they are the first animals that eat the plants. Energy stored in the plant moves into the herbivore when it eats the plant. This energy is then used by that herbivore. Yuck!! The scavengers and decomposers help move energy through the food chain. Bacteria and fungi return it to the soil where plants can once again use it. (See the picture below.) Consumers use it as they eat the plants or the scavengers and decomposers. Many food chains are created and these food chains become a food web with living things all dependent upon each other for survival
