In someone who is being treated for HIV/AIDS, it means that the treatment is not effective. During treatment and monitoring, a high viral load can be anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 copies/mL. A low viral load is usually between 40 to 500 copies/mL, depending on the type and sensitivity of the test used. This result indicates that HIV is not actively reproducing and that the risk of disease progression is low. An undetectable viral load in someone who has a diagnosed HIV infection does not mean that the person is cured; it means only that the level of HIV RNA is currently below the threshold needed for detection. Changes in viral load can often be more important during HIV monitoring than a single test result.
