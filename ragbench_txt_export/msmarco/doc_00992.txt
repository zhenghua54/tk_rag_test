What is average in your area might not be so average in another area. Attorney fees vary by district and can even vary widely from state to state. A recent study using data from 2005 to 2009 shows that the average fee for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, nationally, is between $1,080 and $1,200. But when it was broken down by state, the average fee was as low as $700 in Idaho and as high as $1,530 in Arizona.
