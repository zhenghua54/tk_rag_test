Radiometric dating (often called radioactive dating) is a technique used to date materials such as rocks or carbon, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated when they formed. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in micas, feldspars, and hornblendes, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350 °C (mica) to 500 °C (hornblende).
