Principal scientists work full-time, and they often work more than 40 hours per week in a combination of desk work and lab work. Principal scientists must be analytically minded, with a strong commitment to the scientific process, sound research methodology, and mathematically based reasoning. They must be capable decision-makers, as they guide the efforts of the research team. Principal scientists must also have detailed knowledge of relevant technology and equipment. For instance, principal scientists working in manufacturing often must be able to test materials with centrifuges, radiological equipment, lasers, and related equipment.
