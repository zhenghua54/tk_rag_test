HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness, and is also often called HLS. HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value, and is also often called HSB (B for brightness). A third model, common in computer vision applications, is HSI, for hue, saturation, and intensity. If we plot hue and (a) HSL lightness or (b) HSV value against chroma rather than saturation, the resulting solid is a bicone or cone, respectively, not a cylinder. Such diagrams often claim to represent HSL or HSV directly, with the chroma dimension deceptively labeled saturation.
