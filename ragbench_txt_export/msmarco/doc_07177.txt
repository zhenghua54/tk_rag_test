The most common cause of laryngitis is a viral infection, often similar to those that cause the common cold or flu. Overusing the voice-cheering at an event, for example-can also cause inflammation of the larynx. In very rare instances, acute laryngitis can be caused by diphtheria, a bacterial infection. Not all hoarseness occurs as a result of an infection or laryngitis. Chronic hoarseness may be unrelated to laryngitis, with the cause varying in severity. Some causes of hoarseness include: 1  Cancer. 2  Age-related changes to the vocal cords. 3  Paralysis of the vocal cords as a result of another condition.
