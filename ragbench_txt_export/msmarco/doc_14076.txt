Herpes Simplex. The herpes simplex virus is responsible for the occurrence of both oral herpes, or cold sores, and genital herpes. Lysine may hold the virus in check and decrease the number of cold sores or genital herpes outbreaks you experience, and it may also make the sores heal more quickly. L-lysine may help reduce the occurrence of cold sores. Although more than 300 different amino acids exist in nature, only 20 serve as building blocks for proteins, and lysine is one of them.
