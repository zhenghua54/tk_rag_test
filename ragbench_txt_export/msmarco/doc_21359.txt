The short answer is that for a formal check it usually takes at least one to three days, but often up to a week. However keep in mind that many positions require an FBI background check which takes approximately thirty days and be aware that each situation varies because certain factors can hold this process up. Different employers mean different things when they say they’re going to do a background check. For some this simply means calling references to confirm that names and dates match the references’ records. Many factors can slow down a formal background check. One is that an applicant’s carelessness in filling out an application can cause delays when the information provided does not match the information on record with reporting agencies.
