WLAN adhoc mode vs infrastructure mode-Difference between adhoc mode and infrastructure mode. In Wireless LAN (WLAN) there are two system entities viz. Access Point(AP) and Stations(STAs). Stations are nothing but simple NICs(network interface cards). In infrastructure mode, wlan network is composed of stations as well as one or more access points(APs). The device Access Point is like base station used in cellular system. All the communications between stations will go through AP.
