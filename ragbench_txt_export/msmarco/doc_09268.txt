Disability as a socially constructed concept. Disability, like race, ethnicity, and culture, is a term whose definitions are culturally derived, even though its meaning in the U.S. has been given what Harry (1992, p. 113) calls transcendent status.. Moreover, because culture is a learned phenomenon, individuals and groups can and do change their ethnic or cultural identities and interests through such processes as migration, conversion, and assimilation or through exposure to modifying influences (Smedley, 1993, quoted in Carter & Qureshi, 1995, p. 241).
