About 100km southwest of Tokyo, rising to a height of 3,776 meters straight up in an almost perfect cone, unique in every respect from the surrounding countryside, it is hard not to admire Mt. Fuji's beauty, and for some, to wonder about how it got there and what is in store for its future. We brought you news that on June 22, Mt. Fuji finally received World Heritage site status by UNESCO. The mountain's symbolism for the country and natural beauty cannot be denied, and it is something of a pilgrimage destination for people, not only from Japan, but from around the world.
