Scheme is a dialect of Lisp that stresses conceptual elegance and simplicity. It is specified in R4RS and IEEE standard P1178. (See the Scheme FAQ for details on standards for Scheme.) Scheme is much smaller than Common Lisp; the specification is about 50 pages, compared to Common Lisp's 1300 page draft standard. The Scheme expression ((f)) is in Common Lisp either (funcall (f)) - if f is a function-or (funcall (funcall f)) - if f is a variable with a function as a value. In above example f is a variable.
