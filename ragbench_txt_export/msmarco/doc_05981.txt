A blood pregnancy test will show a positive result about 3-4 days after implantation and a urine test will show a positive result about 4-5 days after implantation. Just remember that the pregnancy hormone hCG will double every other day-so if you get a negative result don't be afraid to retest in a few days. If you are choosing to take a urine test before you actually miss your period, remember to test with first morning urine so that hormone levels are the most concentrated. When getting pregnant is just about all you can think about, you may wait for any sign that things are going well-that a pregnancy has occurred. Unfortunately, if you are waiting on implantation bleeding to boost your hopes it can be very difficult to determine what's going on.
