As either temperature or voltage is increased, the succession of colors on titanium will always be the same. The exact voltage, or time with the torch, will depend on the size and thickness of the piece of titanium. The correspondence between voltage and color, at least in studio conditions, is somewhat approximate. This causes the oxide layer to appear colored. The mechanism is the same as for the colors on an oil slick or a soap bubble, but with two important differences. First, it is permanent. Second, the thickness of the layer changes in increments, causing it to produce some colors, and only those colors.
