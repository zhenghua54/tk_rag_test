Electrophoresis. There two main techniques by which electrophoresis is achieved today: gel and capillary electrophoresis, both of which are based on the same principle of size and charge based fragment separation. Capillaries are made of fused silica and have an internal diameter of only 50-100Î¼m and can be 25-100cm in length. Similarly to gel electrophoresis, size separation is achieved via use of buffer solutions and application of positive and negative charges at either end of the capillary.
