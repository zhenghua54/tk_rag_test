Types of Chiari Malformations. There are four types of Chiari malformations: Type I. This is by far the most commonly observed type in children. In this type, the lower part of the cerebellum -- but not the brain stem -- extends into an opening at the base of the skull. The opening is called the foramen magnum. Type I is the only type of Chiari malformation that can be acquired. Type II. This is usually only seen in children born with spina bifida. Spina bifida is the incomplete development of the spinal cord and/or its protective covering. Type II is also known as classic Chiari malformation or Arnold-Chiari malformation
