This is driven by the error level on the range measurements. (See Accuracy Factors .) For standalone users, the extent use of phase is a major factor. The noise on the phase is typically 1 mm, that on the range 10 cm to 1 m. Therefore the use of phase data in any one of several ways can improve the solution. The graph shows the accuracy levels of all currently available systems. The vertical axis is the expected accuracy or error level, shown both in centimeters and meters. The horizontal axis is the distance along the earth's surface between the reference station and the remote user.
