Technically, the sister chromatids are connected in the center, but after reading this article and from what I know, I think chiasma is only used to refer to the joining of centromeres when crossing over happens. Obviously, crossing over is only part of meiosis, hence the term chiasma only being used in that context. At the chiasma, the chromatids can exchange genetic information, resulting in new combinations of genetic material. When the chromatids separate and become sister chromosomes, they will contain a different mix of genetic material than their parent chromosomes.
