Senior: 7 to 10 Years and Older. Vets suggest twice-yearly checkups for older pets. Your cat or dog will get vaccines when needed and will get a thorough physical, along with tests to follow up on any problems. Blood and urine tests can give your vet the scoop on your pet's kidney health, thyroid hormone levels, and more.
