The racking strength and shear modulus values of the wall sheathed with 3-mm thick fancy plywood were only60% and 40% of those evaluated from the walls sheathed with 12-mm thick gypsum wall, respectively. While the sheardeformation was increased up to 56% as compared to that of gypsum wall. Asindicated in Table 2, the values of racking strength for the wood-framed wall sheathed with calcium silicate panel aretwice of those wall sheathed with 12-mm thick gypsum boards, in which are commonly used for noise insulation.
