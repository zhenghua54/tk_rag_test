Creep feeding can add 11-22 kg (25-50 lb.) of weight to a calf at weaning. It takes 7-10 kg (15-22 lb.) of calf starter or creep feed for each additional kilogram (2.2 lb.) of weight gain. Creep feeding is most effective when the calf is 3-4 months old, particularly if the calves are eating poor quality forage. Grass-fed cattle grow more slowly than grain-fed cattle, and are often marketed when 2-4 years old. Grain supplements can increase the growth rate, allowing cattle to be marketed earlier. Nevertheless, organic beef producers focus on forage and use grain sparingly.
