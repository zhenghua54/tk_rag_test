Throat mucus, also known as phlegm, can be described as that uncomfortable feeling that you experience when mucus clogs up your throat or drips from the back of your nose. The glands of your throat and nose produce about 1 to 2 liters of mucus per day. Clearing your throat will help the phlegm loosen or break up in the back of the throat, giving way to the uncomfortable feeling. Mucus problems can be a nuisance, but there are some simple ways to remedy it.
