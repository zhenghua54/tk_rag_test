(a) Compare the total mass of these asteroids to the mass of Earth. (b) Assuming a spherical shape and a density of rho, estimate the diameter of an asteroid ANSWER: The total mass of all asteroids would be 20,000 10 17 21kg = 2 10 kg. As we see them today, the asteroids would not make up much of a planet! A single body would have the following size. Use the formula for density: 317 (4/3)5103000  R = 20,000 m or 20 km, so the diameter would be 40 km.
