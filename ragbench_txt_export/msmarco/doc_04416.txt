Using these elements can make an effective ad, but here are a few additional guidelines to follow: 1  Hierarchy of information – Choose the information from the above list that’s most important and make it your main element of the ad. 2  Every piece of information in your ad should be weighted according to its importance. But first, here’s what you should include in every advertisement: 1  Your logo or business name – If your business’s logo/name doesn’t contain what you do, make sure to clarify that in the ad. 2  For example saying “Klimisch’s Inc Collision Repair” instead of just “Klimisch’s Inc.”
