SALT LAKE CITY Legalizing marijuana may decrease the amount of crime, according to new studies recently released. In a study published in PLOS ONE, researchers focused on the crime rates of Part I crimes, which consists of homicide, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny and auto theft, in relation to marijuana use. Researchers found that marijuana did not increase violent crimes. We believe that medical marijuana legalization poses no threat of increased violent crime, Robert Morris, the study's lead author, said to the Huffington Post.
