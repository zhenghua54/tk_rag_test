Lime plaster is type of plaster composed of sand, water, and lime, usually non-hydraulic hydrated lime (also known as slaked lime, high calcium lime or air lime). Ancient lime plaster often contained horse hair for reinforcement and pozzolan additives to reduce the working time. The most commonly-used type of lime for lime plaster—non-hydraulic hydrated lime—only sets through carbonatation of CO 2 in the air, and will not set until dry. The water added to the mix is purely to improve workability and stickiness
