Myocardial perfusion scan with exercise. A myocardial perfusion scan with exercise is used to determine what areas of the heart muscle (myocardium) demonstrate decreased blood flow during exercise. This is done by injecting a radionuclide (thallium or technetium) into a vein in the arm or hand during exercise. There are two types of stress myocardial perfusion scans, one that is used in conjunction with exercise (myocardial perfusion scan with exercise) and one that is used in conjunction with medication (pharmacologic myocardial perfusion scan).
