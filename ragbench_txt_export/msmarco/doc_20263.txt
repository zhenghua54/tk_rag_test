Most states require drivers to carry some type of auto insurance on their vehicles. In those cases, the minimum requirement is usually basic liability protection that covers personal injury and property damage. Lenders can also require insurance to protect their financial interest in a vehicle while money is owed on it. Even though several parties can have insurable interest, it’s not necessary for each interested party to carry his own policy on the car. In fact, doing so could create significant problems when it comes time to collect. Insurance companies are like any other business in that they’re in it to make money.
