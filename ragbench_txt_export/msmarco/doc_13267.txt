It causes the ligaments that hold your shoulder in place to stretch. A common risk in many sports, a dislocated shoulder can leave you on the sidelines for three months. Following a shoulder dislocation, expect that your arm may be immobilized for about four weeks to allow the joint time to heal properly. A sling or a shoulder immobilizer will prevent you from using your shoulder. In general, dislocated shoulders fully heal within four to 12 weeks depending on your age, the amount and severity of structural damage that was done to the muscles and ligaments at the time of dislocation, and your physical therapy regimen.
