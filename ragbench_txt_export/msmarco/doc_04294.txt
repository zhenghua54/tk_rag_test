DEFINITION of 'Trade'. A basic economic concept that involves multiple parties participating in the voluntary negotiation and then the exchange of one's goods and services for desired goods and services that someone else possesses. The advent of money as a medium of exchange has allowed trade to be conducted in a manner that is much simpler and effective compared to earlier forms of trade, such as bartering. In financial markets, trading also can mean performing a transaction that involves the selling and purchasing of a security.
