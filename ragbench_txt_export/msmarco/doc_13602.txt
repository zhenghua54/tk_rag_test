You might be familiar with the testing procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . In this test, radio waves, a magnetic field, and a computer create a scan of your body parts to look for health problems. Magnetic resonance angiography – also called a magnetic resonance angiogram or MRA – is a type of MRI that looks specifically at the body’s blood vessels.
