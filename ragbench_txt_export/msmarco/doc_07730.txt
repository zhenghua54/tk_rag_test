Although most metal-bearing mineral compositions comprise several elements, there are a few exceptions such as gold, which is found in its elemental form as a mineral called native gold. Metals can form, or be part of, many different minerals. The number of metals (over 70 in the periodic table) and their compounds results in an enormous array of minerals. Iron, for instance, which is very abundant in nature, is found in over 1100 minerals*. The brilliant colours frequently associated with gems such as emerald, ruby and sapphire reflect the variety of metal-containing minerals.
