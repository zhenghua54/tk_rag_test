The Treaty of Versailles, which the Allies signed with Germany at the end of the First World War, has had a bad reputation ever since. John Maynard Keynes, the great economist, thought it was stupid, vindictive and short-sighted and most writers of history and the public have followed his lead ever since. Due to the fact that it basically eliminated Germany's army, that country grew hungry for power, and eventually came the rise of the Nazis, and World War II. The Treaty of Versailles, while it may have seemed like a good idea at first, led to the rise of fascism.
