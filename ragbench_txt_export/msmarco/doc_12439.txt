Gout most commonly affects the joints of the big toe, but can occur elsewhere in the body, including the joints and surrounding areas of the foot, ankle, or knee. Gout is caused by an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. Crystals can form when abnormally high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) are present in the body over an extended period of time.Mild hyperuricemia usually does no harm, and most people with hyperuricemia never develop gout.
