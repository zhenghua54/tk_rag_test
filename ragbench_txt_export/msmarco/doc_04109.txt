On the other hand, depression and other mental illnesses are extremely complex, and I remain suspicious of any theory that tries to tell one simple story about them. Better perhaps to treat the dark room as just one of many contributing factors, or even just a useful metaphor. It also fits well with predictive processing and the dark room problem. Predictive processing has already been applied to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and other delusions (in the form of false error signals), and similarly I think we could say that in some cases the dark room problem simply isn't a problem.
