3. Measure out the mass of NaOH needed to prepare 100 mL of a 0.10 M solution and add it to the flask of distilled water. Swirl the flask to dissolve the solid. CAUTION: Sodium hydroxide solution is caustic. The process of determining the unknownâ€™s concentration is called standardization. Solutions of sodium hydroxide are virtually impossible to prepare to a precise molar concentration because the substance is hygroscopic.
