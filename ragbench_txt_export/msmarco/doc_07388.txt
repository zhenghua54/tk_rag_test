Ambiguity Edit. The Necker Cube is an ambiguous line drawing. It is a wire-frame drawing of a cube in isometric perspective, which means that parallel edges of the cube are drawn as parallel lines in the picture. When two lines cross, the picture does not show which is in front and which is behind. Epistemology Edit. The Necker Cube is used in epistemology (the study of knowledge) and provides a counter-attack against naive na√Øve. Realism naive (realism aka direct or-common sense) realism states that the way we perceive the world is the way the world actually. is
