The heart is invested in a parietal and visceral layer of pericardium with the pericardial space separating the two membranes. Cranially, the costal and mediastinal pleura adjoin to form a 'dome' of pleura which extends to the thoracic inlet. This is known as the cupulae pleurae. The visceral pleura which coats the outer surface of the lung is derived from the splanchnic mesoderm. The parietal pleura lining the thoracic cavity is derived from somatic mesoderm. The pleural cavity is a potential space between the two areas of pleural membrane, which normally are adhesed to each other.
