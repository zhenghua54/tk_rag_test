Yersinia is implicated as one of the causes of reactive arthritis worldwide. Also, the genus is associated with pseudoappendicitis, which is an incorrect diagnosis of appendicitis due to a similar presentation. An interesting feature peculiar to some of the Yersinia bacteria is the ability to not only survive, but also to actively proliferate at temperatures as low as 1-4Â°C (e.g., on cut salads and other food products in a refrigerator).
