Geographical Setting of the Silk Roads. Silk Road in Sumur, India today (sanjoyg/flickr). by John Major. The term Silk Road denotes a network of trails and trading posts, oases and emporia connecting East Asia to the Mediterranean. Trade along the Silk Road waxed or waned according to conditions in China, Byzantium, Persia, and other regions and countries along the way. There were always competing or alternative routes, by land and sea, to absorb long distance Eurasian trade when conditions along the Silk Road were unfavorable.
