Most babies take their first steps by their first birthday. By the time they're 15 months old most toddlers are walking unaided, though often with uneven steps. Try not to worry if your baby takes a little longer. Some children don't walk until they are 17 or 18 months old. Babies who bottom-shuffle tend to walk later than babies who crawl.
