Publisert 2. feb. 2015. Our word of the day is “Multinational Corporation”. A multinational corporation is a business that has its facilities and other assets in at least one country other than its home country. Such companies have offices and/or factories in different countries and usually have a centralized head office where they co-ordinate global management. Generally, any company or group that derives a quarter of its revenue from operations outside of its home country is considered a multinational corporation.
