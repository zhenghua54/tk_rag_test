Spread 1/4 cup of the shrimp mixture onto each slice of bread, spreading to the edges and smoothing the top. Heat the vegetable oil to 360 degrees F in large deep skillet. Add the shrimp toast in batches, coated sides down, and fry until golden on the first side, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Turn and cook until golden on the second side, about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. To serve, cut each toast diagonally into quarters. Directions. Combine the shrimp, egg, egg white, green onions, parsley, garlic, salt, and white pepper in a food processor and process until blended but still slightly chunky. Add the cream cheese and pulse until smooth and thick.
