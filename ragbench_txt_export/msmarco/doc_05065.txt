The stratosphere, mesosphere and lowest part of the thermosphere are collectively referred to as the middle atmosphere, which spans heights from approximately 10 kilometres (33,000 ft) to 100 kilometres (62 mi). Within the mesosphere, temperature decreases with increasing height. This is due to decreasing solar heating and increasing cooling by CO 2 radiative emission. The top of the mesosphere, called the mesopause, is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.
