Ketel One is produced by the Nolet Distillery in Schiedam, Holland. The Nolet Distillery was founded in 1691, and has remained in the Nolet family ever since. Ketel One is so named for the original coal-fired copper still that was used to distill it, Distilleerketel #1. Ketel One Vodka is distilled from 100% wheat in copper pot stills, filtered over loose charcoal, and rests in tile lined tanks until ready.
