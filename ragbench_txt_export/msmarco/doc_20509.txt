Broiling is a fast and easy way to cook foods without extra oils or fats. Broiling works by applying a heat source directly above the food. This high heat cooks the food quickly from the top down. Both meat and vegetables can be broiled; the use of seasonings, liquids or oils is entirely optional. Turn over thin cuts of meat or thicker cuts you are broiling to rare or medium rare after 7 to 10 minutes, depending on how far away the food is from the burners. Turn over thicker cuts of meat you are broiling to well done after 15 minutes. Replace the broiler pan and close the oven.
