Kuroudou Dr. Jackal Akabane works as a Transporter (hakobiya in Japanese), a person paid to escort things to a certain location. With his formal attire, consisting of a dress shirt, black tie, fedora hat and suit coat, polite manners and ever-present smile, he could be mistaken for a harmless person. Kyoji Kagami refers to Akabane as Babylon City's Kuroudou Akabane, so it is safe to assume he was, at one point, a resident of the upper towers. His reason for leaving is never revealed but it may be that he was bored.
