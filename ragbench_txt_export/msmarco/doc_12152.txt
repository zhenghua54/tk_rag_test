A: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that is used to treat edema (fluid retention) from various causes such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney disorders, or medication-induced (from estrogen or steroids). Hydrochlorothiazide may also be prescribed to treat calcium-containing kidney stones because it decreases the amount of calcium excreted by the kidneys in the urine, thus reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones.
