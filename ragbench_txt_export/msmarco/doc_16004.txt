There is no mandatory manner in which to perform spoken word, however, certain aspects of the artistry indicate that it is, indeed, spoken word. Spoken word usually tends to focus on the performance of the words themselves, the dynamics of tone, gestures, facial expressions, and more. Modern North American spoken-word poetry originated from the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance and blues music as well as the 1960s beatniks. Modern-day spoken-word poetry became popular in the underground Black community in the 1960s with The Last Poets.
