Veins are blood vessels carrying blood towards the heart, whereas arteries bring blood away from heart. Mostly, arteries contain oxygenated blood, and veins contain carbon d â€¦ ioxide-rich and oxygen-poor blood; however, there is one exception. When the arteries deposit the oxygen and other nutrients through the capillaries, the blood then moves to the veins, which will carry the blood back to the heart. The veins are made from all the capillary branches moving back to gether.
