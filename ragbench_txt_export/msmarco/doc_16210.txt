Ceiling Fans for Small Rooms. Not surprisingly, smaller rooms need smaller ceiling fans. Ceiling fan size can be determined by measuring the height and width of your room. If you are installing a fan in a patio, bathroom, den, or small bedroom, it is important to measure the height of the ceiling. If you have a low hanging ceiling you may want to purchase a flush mount ceiling fan. The blade span of vaulted ceiling fans can vary. If your vaulted ceiling is low and your slope is small, you should determine the fan size based on the room size. If you have a higher ceiling and need a longer downrod, itâ€™s best to purchase a fan with a larger blade span that can fully circulate the air.
