A parent, guardian or the student may take out a student loan. In the United States, the federal government subsidizes or guarantees some student loans to enable more people to attend college. Interest on student loans is also tax deductible in the United States. However, because universities in the United States are often so expensive, many students spend a significant portion of their income on student debt service.
