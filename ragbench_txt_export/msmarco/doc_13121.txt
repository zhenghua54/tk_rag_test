Although some manufacturers set water heater thermostats at 140ºF, most households usually only require them to be set at 120ºF, which also slows mineral buildup and corrosion in your water heater and pipes. Water heated at 140ºF also poses a safety hazard—scalding. 2.) Mark the setting, then turn down the thermostat. Mark the beginning temperature on your water heater thermostat with a marker, and then turn the thermostat down.
