Superheated steam is steam at a temperature higher than its vaporization (boiling) point at the absolute pressure where the temperature is measured. If saturated steam is reduced in temperature (whilst retaining its pressure) it will condense to produce water droplets, even if it is still considerably above the boiling point of 100 Â°C at standard pressure.
