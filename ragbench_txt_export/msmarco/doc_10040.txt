Isla de la Juventud, or Isle of Youth is the second-largest Cuban island and the seventh-largest island in the West Indies. Overall Cuba's land is relatively flat, flowing gradually into hills, including a few hills of limestone shown to the right. Cuba's coastal areas are the most mountainous. In the Sierra de los Organos of the far-northwest the landscape is hilly with a few lower mountains. In the southwest the Sierra Maestra is a mountain range that rises sharply from the coast.
