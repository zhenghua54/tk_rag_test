A eukaryotic cell contains many organelles, for example, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and chloroplast (plastid). However, not all these organelles are found in only one cell or in an organism. The chloroplast, for instance, is abundant in plant cells but not in animal cells. Definition. noun, plural of organelle. Literally, the term means little organs. As the body is composed of various organs, the cell, too, has little organs that perform special functions.
