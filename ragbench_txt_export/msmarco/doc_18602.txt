The spinal nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Location: Each spinal nerve is formed by the combination of nerve fibers from the dorsaland ventral roots of the spinal cord (Figure 0). The dorsal roots carry afferent sensory axons, while the ventral roots carry efferent motor axons. ï‚· Mixed Spinal Nerve: The term spinal nerve generally refers to a mixed spinal nerve, which carries motor, sensory, and autonomic signals between the spinal cord and the body. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord.
