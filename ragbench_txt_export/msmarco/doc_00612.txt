A standard document for the sale of residential freehold land by a mortgagee. This standard document incorporates the Standard Conditions of Sale (Fifth Edition) (SCS). A number of the provisions in the contract modify and exclude the SCS. Where title to the Property (or part of it) is unregistered, it may be convenient to annex the epitome of title to the contract (see Annex 3). For a form of epitome that may be used for this purpose, see Standard document, Epitome of title (www.practicallaw.com/5-383-5260) .
