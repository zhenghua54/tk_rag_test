Dollar for dollar. Only one of these two dollar stores is a true dollar store, for now, and that's Dollar Tree. While Family Dollar Stores has many items priced at $1 or less, it also has many more priced higher than $1 and even higher than $5. Slashing over 1,000 items, Family Dollar Stores intends to move more in the direction of Dollar Tree. If these estimates are realized, this represents earnings-per-share growth in the 15-something percentage range for each fiscal year. Family Dollar Stores meanwhile trades with a P/E of 21 and 19.5 based on analyst estimates of $3.15 and $3.43 for the fiscal years ending August 2014 and August 2015 respectively.
