Almost without exception, a new professor is hired at the 'assistant professor' level. For the next few years, that professor goes through the 'tenure' process-establishing a track record for teaching and research in their field. The professor makes up exams, and usually does the lectures. The associate professor is a backup in case the professor is sick, etc. Usually the associate does the grading with help of assistants. Associate professors have just as much power as professors. An assistant professor does what the professors don't do, like grading homeworks and helping specific students with work in a larger class.
