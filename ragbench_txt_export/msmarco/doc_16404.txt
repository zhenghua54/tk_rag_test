Reclamation Safety and Health Standards C-2 October 2009 grounding conductor is the same conductor. This is permitted only on the line side of the service disconnect. On the load side of the service disconnect, the neutral cannot be used as the equipment grounding conductor. For example, if you do not have an equipment grounding conductor, but you do have a good ground rod (NEC 250-84 indicates that a good ground rod is 25 ohms), Ohms law (I = V/R) gives the current flow.
