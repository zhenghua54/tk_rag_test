If an employee is subject to this law (non-exempt), when they reach more than 40 hours in a given work week, they have to be paid at time and a half for any additional hours. If they are not subject to the law (exempt), they aren't eligible for overtime, but there are other rules that come with, like no docking pay. This means that no matter how much it annoys you, if you have an exempt employee who takes off two hours early to do anything--doctor's appointment, soccer tournament, just plain bored and wanted to go home--you cannot dock her pay. It's helpful to think of this in terms of a touch the wall rule.
