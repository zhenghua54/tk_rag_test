The three major salivary glands are the parotid gland, submandibular gland (also called the submaxillary gland), and sublingual glands. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts. 1  The parotid gland makes 25% of the saliva and drains into the mouth near the upper teeth. 1 The parotid gland makes 25% of the saliva and drains into the mouth near the upper teeth. 2  The submandibular gland makes 70% of the salvia and drains into the mouth from under the tongue. 3  The sublingual gland makes 5% of the saliva and drains into the floor of the mouth.
