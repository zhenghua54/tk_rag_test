3. weenis. Lot's of opinions that it's the skin on your elbow--when I was a kid 30 years ago, however, it quite clearly was used as a combo-word in between Wussy and Penis.. So if you weren't quite a Wussy (Weiner/Pussy), and you were kind of acting like a dick, you were a Weenis/Weenus. An excuse for 12-17 year old guys to say a word that sounds like penis but isn't penis. Most claim that the weenis is the flap of skin under your elbow, but we all know that.
