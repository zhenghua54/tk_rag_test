Escobar is cool, but he's not the godly side of Nas that makes him a living legend. Hate Me Now is a classic, but it ain't even close to as dope or important as One Love. Anyone who doesn't agree with that must like rap music for a different reason than I do. I'll leave it at that. There's a song on Nas' dad Olu Dara's album From Natchez to New York called Jungle Jay that I never hear anyone talk about. It features Nas flipping a straight-up street, almost Def Poetry Jam style that is ridiculously dope. And it was released during that late '90s Escobar era
