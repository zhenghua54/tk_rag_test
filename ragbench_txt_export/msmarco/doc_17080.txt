The answers below are correct. Mobile homes that are not on owned land are almost impossible to be financed. The interest rate on mobile homes that are on their own lot can be financed with about 25% down and the interest rate is typically 1 percent higher than the frame built home. You can purchase the land and the mobile home together in one loan which is very common.
