You do need hoof oil to paint on inside and outside the horse's hoof to maintain flexibility and prevent them drying out and cracking and splitting, and also to maintain the frogs and prevent them from becoming waterlogged in damp conditions. It is a necessity for good hoof maintenance. Hoof oil moisturizes the hooves, giving them their natural flex back and helps prevent cracking and chipping. Hoof oil is not a replacement for proper diet and nutrition which is what could be causing the problems with the horse's feet.
