This type of respiration in which oxygen is not used as a final electron acceptor is referred to as anaerobic. In anaerobic respiration (respiration in absence of oxygen), pyruvate is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. (1) Glycolysis. (2) Citric Acid cycle or Krebs Cycle. (3) Oxidative phosphorylation. The cell seems to respire in a way that it takes in molecular oxygen (as an electron acceptor) and releases carbon dioxide (as an end product), hence, the process is described to be aerobic.
