As an opportunistic pathogen, C. freundii is responsible for a number of significant infections. It is known to be the cause of a number of nosocomial infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood, and many other normally sterile sites in patients. C. freundii is responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite in the environment. This conversion is an important and crucial stage in the nitrogen cycle. These bacteria also help in recycling nitrogen. C. freundii has also been investigated for biodegradation of tannic acid used in tanneries.
