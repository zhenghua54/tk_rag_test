Subtract the calculated tax deductions for Medicare, Social Security, federal and state taxes from your pay period salary. For example, a $600.00 salary minus $8.70 for Medicare, $25.20 for Social Security, $57.00 for federal and $21.97 for state taxes is a weekly salary of $487.13 per week after taxes. Multiply the pay period salary after taxes by the pay period frequency to calculate your annual salary after taxes. For example, if your weekly salary after taxes is $487.13 and your pay period frequency is weekly (or 52 times per year), your annual salary after taxes is $25,330.76
