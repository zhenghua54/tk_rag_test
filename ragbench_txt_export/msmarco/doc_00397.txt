All multipolar neurons have two characteristics: -- more than two processes emanate from the cell body, and -- the cell body receives synaptic input just like the dendrites. Fig. 3. Schematic drawing of a ventral horn SE multipolar neuron. A number of dendrites and one axon emanate from the cell body. The axon has few if any branches until its termination in a profusion of branches. The axon is specialized for conducting excitation from the input region to the output region of the neuron.
