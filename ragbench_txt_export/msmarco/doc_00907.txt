If you try to create a new Facebook account with same e-mail id, you will get an error “ There is an existing account associated with this email address.” However if you are using Gmail, you can tweak to create two or more Facebook accounts with same e-mail. Here’s how it works: Personally, I think its easier to just create multiple free email accounts and create FB accounts with those individually. FB doesn’t seem to worry about multiple accounts unless there’s spamming involved. They have no way to prove its the same person or several people using the same computer.
