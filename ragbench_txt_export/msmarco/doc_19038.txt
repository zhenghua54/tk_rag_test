For centuries, ingredients have served useful functions in a variety of foods. Our ancestors used salt to preserve meats and fish, added herbs and spices to improve the flavor of foods, preserved fruit with sugar, and pickled cucumbers in a vinegar solution. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains a list of over 3000 ingredients in its data base Everything Added to Food in the United States, many of which we use at home every day (e.g., sugar, baking soda, salt, vanilla, yeast, spices and colors).
