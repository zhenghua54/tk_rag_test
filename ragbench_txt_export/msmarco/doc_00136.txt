A genus is a scientific way of showing that species are very closed related to each other. In fact the first word of the species' scientific name is its genus. So for lions (Panthera leo), Panthera is the genus and tells us that they are closely related to tigers (Panthera tigris), because they share the name. 1  Bottlenose dolphins.
