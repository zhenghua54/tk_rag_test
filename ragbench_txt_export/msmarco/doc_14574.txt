Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells that starts in the bone marrow, causing the marrow to produce abnormal white blood cells. Like the blobby looking cells in this photo, the leukemia cells eventually crowd out healthy white cells, sapping the body's infection-fighting capabilties. Over time, leukemia cells also crowd out red blood cells and platelets, impairing the blood's ability to carry oxygen and clot.
