What is the difference between AF-A, AF-S, AF-C and MF focus modes on Nikon camera's. When you set your camera lens to AF (auto focus), digital SLR cameras offer the photographer a choice between interchangeable modes. Auto focus modes can vary between different digital camera brands. This is also the default camera focus mode, unless you change the setting to AF-C or AF-S. MF is the manual focus mode. It's unclear why this focus mode is included, because nowadays there is usually an option to switch between auto and manual focus on the side of the actual lens.
