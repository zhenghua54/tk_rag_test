My life again. One Day I'll fly away. Leave your love to yesterday. What more can your love do for me. When will love be through with me. Why live life from dream to dream. And dread the day that dreaming ends. One day i'll fly away, fly away, fly away (repeat to fade). Lyrics taken from http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/randy_crawford/one_day_ill_fly_away.html.
