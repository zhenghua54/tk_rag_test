Stone tile countertops are less expensive than solid stone counters. The tile is real stone but can range from 3/8 to 1/2 inch in thickness. The tile is mortared over a cement board or membrane covered plywood adding an additional 7/8 to 1 1/8 inch. This brings the thickness of the countertop to 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inch.
