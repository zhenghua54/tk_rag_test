Definition. Monoclonal antibodies are complex proteins derived from a single B cell made by the body's immunological defence system to recognise and fight foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Each monoclonal antibody is designed to recognise and bind to specific cell-surface receptors. Monoclonal antibodies are made from natural antibodies made by the body to fight foreign invaders. Their production involves several steps. In the first instance a laboratory animal is injected with a desired target to stimulate their immune system to produce antibodies.
