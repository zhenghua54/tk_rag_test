I have just demolished my house (Perth). It was built in the 1950's and had the deadly blue asbestos as eaves linings and was also used as packing in various locations. $17.00 was the total cost for disposal for 300kg's (included some deep 6 abestos fence sheets) at an official disposal site. There is only 2 sites in Melbourne, one out near Eltham and one in Altona Nth. $35 handling fee and then $0.80/kg from memory. I had the faux brick asbestos cladding removed from a 12 square cal bungalow-cost $3,500....
