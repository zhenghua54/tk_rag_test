The new MCI Worldcom Internet service is available to MCI Worldcom long-distance subscribers for $16.95 a month for the first 150 hours of local access. The new service allows MCI Worldcom to re-enter the consumer Internet business that the MCI Communications Corporation exited last year. MCI sold its Internet operations to gain regulatory approval for its $40 billion acquisition by Worldcom Inc. last September.
