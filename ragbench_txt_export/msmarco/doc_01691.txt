Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar). Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by a glucose (blood sugar) level that is too low to effectively fuel the body's blood cells. To treat low blood sugar immediately, you should eat or drink something that has sugar in it, such as orange juice, milk, or a hard candy. For people who do not have diabetes, treatment (as directed by a doctor) depends on the cause of hypoglycemia.
