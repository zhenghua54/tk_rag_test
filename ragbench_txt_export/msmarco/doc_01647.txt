If your dentist thinks you may need your wisdom teeth removed, they'll usually carry out an X-ray of your mouth. This gives them a clearer view of the position of your teeth. As with any teeth problems, it's important to see your dentist as soon as possible, rather than waiting for your regular dental check-up. The time it takes to remove the tooth will vary. Some procedures only take a few minutes, whereas others can take 20 minutes or longer. After your wisdom teeth have been removed, you may experience swelling and discomfort, both on the inside and outside of your mouth. This is usually worse for the first three days, but it can last for up to two weeks. Read more about how a wisdom tooth is removed and recovering from wisdom tooth removal
