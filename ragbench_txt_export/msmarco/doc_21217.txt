Alternate methods of direct arthrography examinations may also use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) following contrast material injection into the joint. An x-ray (radiograph) is a noninvasive medical test that helps physicians diagnose and treat medical conditions. 1 Direct arthrography is particularly effective for detecting disease of the structures within the joints such as ligaments, tendons and cartilage. 2  This is particularly true for the shoulder in the setting of shoulder dislocation and in the hip, wrist and elbow.
