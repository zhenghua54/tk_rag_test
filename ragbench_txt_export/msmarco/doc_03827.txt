1 Voltage is a measure of the energy carried by the charge. 2  Strictly: voltage is the 'energy per unit charge'. 3  The proper name for voltage is potential difference or p.d. for short, but this term is rarely used in electronics. 4  Voltage is supplied by the battery (or power supply). Voltage attempts to make a current flow, and current will flow if the circuit is complete. Voltage is sometimes described as the 'push' or 'force' of the electricity, it isn't really a force but this may help you to imagine what is happening.
