Most women's first prenatal visit occurs between 6 and 8 weeks after the first day of their last menstrual period. As long as your pregnancy is considered low risk and is progressing normally, you will visit your doctor monthly for the first 28 weeks, then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, and weekly thereafter. Ideally, you should have a pre-conceptual visit with your provider to make sure you are in optimal health before becoming pregnant. But don't worry if you discover you are pregnant before having a chance to meet with your doctor or midwife; these conversations and tests will occur during your first prenatal visit.
