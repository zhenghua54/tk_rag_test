When i finish the job, i send in my invoice with a copy of the time tracking record sheet. I charge for transcription per hour and for translation per word. Fanurio can be downloaded for a fee. It works very well with jobs that require proof of how much time was spent. elham James (Jim) Davis wrote: I remember doing this years ago. If it is a specific job you want to quote for, you have to define what the job entails. It sounds that there is only transcription, no time cueing or translation involved. I don't think that you can afford to spend much more that ten minutes transcribing one minute of the spoken word.
