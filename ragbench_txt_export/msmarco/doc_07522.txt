Factor Analysis. Exploratory factor analysis is a statistical approach that can be used to analyze interrelationships among a large number of variables and to explain these variables in terms of a smaller number of common underlying dimensions. Factor analysis is based on a correlation table. If there are k items in the study (e.g. k questions in the above example) then the correlation table has k Ã— k entries of form rij where each rij is the correlation coefficient between item i and item j.
