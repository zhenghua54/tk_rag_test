Do a backup of the old phone with the new name, and then connect your new phone, and back it up under its current name. Level 1 (0 points). I JUST did this exact process-upgraded from an iPhone 4 to a 5s, and then turned the 4 into an iPod for my daughter. 1. Leave the old SIM in the old phone. 2. Change the name of the old phone in iTunes (click on the name of the old phone on the summary page). 4. On the same Message settings screen, Add another email (my daughter's in this case). I had to go in and verify it with Apple-it sends an email to facilitate this. Make sure the new email is checked.
