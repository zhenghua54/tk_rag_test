Wild rodents (chipmunks, squirrels, mice, rats, muskrats) and rabbits can be found throughout Ohio and are well-adapted to living in urban, suburban and rural environments. In addition, many types of rodents have become popular pocket pets (hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs) along with domestic rabbits and hedgehogs. T. mentagrophytes causes scaly white lesions around the head of mice and rabbits, although some animals may be inapparent carriers without signs of disease. People can develop dermatophytosis after contact with infected rodents or rabbits.
