I don’t mind if the sleepers are slightly big but don’t waste too much money on newborn size sleepers that may only fit for the first 1-2 weeks of my baby’s life. Another thing you should consider is the weather when your baby is born. If you don’t mind doing laundry every other day, then you may only need 5-6 sleepers in each size. This would give you enough sleepers to plan for changes throughout the day due to diaper blowouts and spit ups.
