1 Saying I love you in the heat of passion for the first time might not be a good idea, as the person may question the sincerity of your pledge. 2  Follow them up with actions of kindness. 3  If your interest is not in the other person, but rather in how that person can enhance your experience of life, then it is not love. Whether or not your family is comfortable expressing their love for each other, be the icebreaker and tell them. 1  You can tell them during an eventâ€”a wedding dinner, Thanksgiving, or just a family dinner. 2  You can tell them in private, in an unguarded moment.
