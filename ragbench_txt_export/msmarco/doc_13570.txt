It take approximately 5 seconds for a strong laser to hit the moon and return to earth.   __________________   It's less than that. The Moon's orbit averages 384,400 km … from Earth, and the speed of light is 300,000 KM/sec. So the round-trip is closer to 2.4 seconds. Let's do the math: The average distance between the moon's surface and the earth's surface is 380,500 kilometers(km). Light is an electromagnetic wave an … d travels at a speed roughly 3 x 10^8 meters/second(m/s) in a vacuum.
