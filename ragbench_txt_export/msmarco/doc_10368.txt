For example, if you were 8 years old when you were last treated in the hospital, the hospital must keep your records 20 years (28-8=20). It is recommended that doctors must keep your medical records for a minimum of 7 years after your last visit. In the case of a minor, your doctor should keep your record at least 7 years after the last visit or until you reach the age of 25, whichever occurs later. Health care providers may charge for copying your medical record for you. Under Colorado law, your provider is allowed to charge you no more than the following fees: $14 for the first ten or fewer pages; 50¢ per page for pages 11-40; and 33¢ per page for pages 41 and up.
