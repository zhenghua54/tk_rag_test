Up to Top of Page. Incubation lasts about 14-16 days--perhaps as long as 21 days in cool weather--during which time the female Ruby-throated Hummingbird is on the nest for about 50-55 minutes out of each hour. When the chicks hatch, they are about 2cm long, altricial (naked), and with very short bills. After spending the winter months in Mexico or Central America, male Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) typically arrive in the United States and Canada beginning in late March--earlier along the Gulf Coast, later in New England and Canada.
