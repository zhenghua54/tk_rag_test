Report Abuse. The soonest you'll ever become a physician is 7 years after college (4 years of medical school and 3 years residency). The residency for an orthopedic surgeon is quite long. I'd expect it to be 5 or 6 years. Best Answer: 4 years undergrad 4 years med school 3+ years residency (thats where you learn the skills required to be a orthopedic surgeon).
