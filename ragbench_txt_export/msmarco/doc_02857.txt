The reported normal range for this bilayer endometrial thickness is up to 5 mm in asymptomatic postmenopausal women not receiving hormones and up to 8 mm in asymptomatic postmenopausal women on HRT. Some advocate calling all measurements greater than 5 mm abnormal with or without HRT. In 24 patients with primary endometrial malignancy reported by Walsh and Goplerud, CT showed normal uterine attenuation findings in 50% of patients and 1- to 5-cm low-attenuation tumor areas in the uterus in the other 50% of patients.
