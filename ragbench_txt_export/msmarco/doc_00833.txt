Monosaccharides consist of a carbon chain of three or more carbon atoms containing a hydroxyl group attached to every carbon except one. The lone carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom, and this carbonyl group may be in any position along the carbon chain. Plants synthesize two types of polysaccharides, starch and cellulose. The glycosidic bonds between glucose units in plant starch are similar to those in animal glycogen. Accordingly, starch molecules are structurally similar, forming compact coils, and play a similar role in energy storage for plants.
