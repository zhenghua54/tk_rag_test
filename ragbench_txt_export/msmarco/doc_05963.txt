A hydrocarbon is a molecule that consists primarily of hydrogen and carbon. Other atoms may be present in place of the hydrogen atoms in some places. Examples of hydrocarbo â€¦ ns include Methane (CH4), toluene. A hydrocarbon contains only hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms. There are a large number of hydrocarbons, but the simplest is CH4 (methane). One important thing about hydrocarbons is that they are all flammable. When combined with oxygen (combustion), a hydrocarbon ALWAYS produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O)
