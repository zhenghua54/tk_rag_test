Tissue fluid is collected by the afferent lymphatic vessels which drain into the lymph node where trapping of foreign material occurs to prevent spread around the body. The filtered lymph leaves the lymph node via the efferent lymphatic vessel. The smaller vessels generally travel with blood vessels and nerves. Valves in the vessels prevent back flow and keep the flow of lymph unidirectional. As there is no central pump the movement of lymph is largely dependant on skeletal muscular activity.
