Carefully add 1 or 2 pieces of shrimp toast into the oil, shrimp side down. The bread should float on top of the oil and begin bubbling immediately. Cook for about 1 1/2 minutes, then turn over and cook for about 15 more seconds. Remove the shrimp toast with a slotted toast and drain on paper towels. This is the popular dim sum appetizer, with a shrimp mixture spread on slices of toast and deep-fried. To add something extra to the taste and appearance, feel free to use a good crusty bread such as a French baguette.
