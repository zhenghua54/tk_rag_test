U.S.-ITALY RELATIONS. The United States established diplomatic relations with Italy in 1861 following the unification of most of the peninsula into one state. In 1941, Italy -- with the other World War II Axis powers Germany and Japan -- declared war on the United States. U.S. relations with Italy were reestablished in 1944. Italy maintains an embassy in the United States at 3000 Whitehaven Street, NW, Washington, DC 20008 (tel. 202-612-4400). More information about Italy is available from the Department of State and other sources, some of which are listed here: Department of State Italy Page
