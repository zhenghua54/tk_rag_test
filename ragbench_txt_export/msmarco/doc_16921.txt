Those 45 days do not count as a significant break in coverage. Also, since you have more than 12 months of continuous coverage in a prior health plan, it can be used to fully offset and eliminate the maximum preexisting condition exclusion period under a new plan. 1 For example, if you expect to have a 6-month interruption between jobs and health plans, you can purchase COBRA coverage during that time. 2  COBRA coverage can be counted as creditable coverage as long as there is no significant break after your COBRA coverage ends.
