This tutorial will show you how to unlink OneDrive on your Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 PC to sign out of the OneDrive desktop app, stop syncing files in the OneDrive folder on your PC, and no longer fetch files on your PC from OneDrive.com until you setup the OneDrive desktop again. Note. Note When you unlink OneDrive, it will not remove the PC from OneDrive.com. If you are signed in to Windows 8 with a Microsoft account that is the same one used to sign in to OneDrive.com when setting up the OneDrive desktop app, then you will not be able to unlink OneDrive.
