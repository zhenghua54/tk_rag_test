Why It Is Done. An MRI of the spine is done to: 1  Find problems of the spinal discs, such as a ruptured disc. 2  The test may also show if a disc is pressing on a nerve, causing symptoms such as sciatica. 3  Find areas of the spine where the canal is abnormally narrowed (spinal stenosis) and may need surgery. In some cases, a contrast material may be used during the MRI to show certain parts of the body more clearly. The MRI can find changes in the spine and in other tissues. It also can find problems such as infection or a tumor.
