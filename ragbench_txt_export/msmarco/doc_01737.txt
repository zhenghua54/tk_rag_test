Biostimulation vs. Bioaugmentation Bioremediation uses naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade various types of wastes. Like all living creatures, microbes need nutrients, carbon, and energy to survive and multiply. Biostimulation refers to the addition of specific nutrients to a waste situation with the hope that the correct, naturally occurring microbes are present in sufficient numbers and types to break down the waste effectively.
