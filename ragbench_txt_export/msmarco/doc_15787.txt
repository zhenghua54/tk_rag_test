The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated. This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses. The genome of E. coli consists of a single circular DNA molecule of approximately 4.6 x 10 6 nucleotide pairs. DNA replication typically begins at a single origin of replication. In E. coli, the origin of replication — oriC — consists of three A–T rich 13- mer repeats and four 9-mer repeat
