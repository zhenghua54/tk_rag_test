Assuming each pair of shoes is about a $27 value (half the cost of the average buy-one-give-one TOMS shoe), you can give each child a pair for $27,000, a fix that would likely prevent any continued hookworm incidence for the next two years until the shoes inevitably wear out (that’s a generous time frame). Assuming their margin is 75%, a pair of shoes costs them $7, and the latrine is the equivalent cost of 286 pairs of shoes which could serve 3 communities of the size in your example. I get your argument – solve the underlying problem – but they still need shoes either way.
