Last Update On: 2015-03-23. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein secreted by the placenta during pregnancy that consists of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is structurally similar to the alpha subunits of FSH, LH and TSH. The beta subunit is distinct for hCG. Current pregnancy tests is available that can test either serum or urine. Once a specimen is applied to the device, results are available in 3 minutes for urine and 5 minutes for serum. Sensitivity is 10 IU/mL for serum and 20 mIU/mL for urine. hCG concentrations reach 10 to 25 mIU/mL by 7 to10 days after conception.
