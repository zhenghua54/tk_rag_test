One of the most common misconceptions about pork is that it needs to be cooked well-done. For many years, that meant cooking it to an internal temperature of 160Â°F. Any sign of pink in a grilled pork chop or roasted pork loin was cause for alarm. Unfortunately, that means that generations of people have grown up accustomed to eating overcooked pork.
