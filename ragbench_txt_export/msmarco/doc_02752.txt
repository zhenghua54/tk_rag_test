The cost of engraving a tombstone will widely vary depending on who is performing the procedure, the size of the tombstone, the amount of engraving that has to be done, and other various factors. 1  On average, plan on spending anywhere from $200 to as much as $1,500 for an engraving. 1 Most companies will mainly charge based on the number of letters that will be on the tombstone. 2  Some people may charge per word. 3  For example, a 25-word engraving job on a granite tombstone could cost $200 to $350 while a larger job that has inscriptions on both the front and back could cost upwards of $1,000.
