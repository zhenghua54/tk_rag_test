For this frittata recipe we cook everything in a cast-iron skillet because it can be heated on the stovetop and then transferred to the oven where the cooking is finished. 1 Cook the bacon in a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. 2  When bacon is crispy, remove it from the pan, drain on paper towels and set aside. 3  When it's cool, roughly chop it into ¼ inch pieces — or just crumble it up.
