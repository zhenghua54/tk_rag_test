Energy is obtained more efficiently in the presence of oxygen via the process called aerobic respiration. When there is no oxygen available to break the sugar molecules, some cells are still able to produce energy by the process called fermentation or anaerobic cellular respiration or anaerobic glycolysis. Certain organisms do not need molecular oxygen to produce the energy molecules called ATP. In the process of Yeast fermentation or anaerobic respiration, the most sugars are broken to yield ethanol and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration on the other hand, almost all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic organisms are solely dependent upon a continuous supply of oxygen molecules to sustain life.
