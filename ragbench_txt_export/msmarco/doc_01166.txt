You must have eligible compensation in order to be eligible to contribute to an IRA. For IRA purposes, eligible compensation includes wages, salaries, tips, commissions received as a percentage of sales, taxable alimony and separate maintenance payment you receive under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance. You may contribute up to $5,500 to your IRA for 2013. If you are at least age 50 by the end of the year to which the contribution applies, you may contribute an additional $1,000. This additional amount is referred to as a catch-up contribution
