1 All-porcelain crowns are the most delicate, most lifelike and most expensive and the cost reflects this. 2  These types of crowns cost from $800 to over $3,000. 3  Insurance copays for all-porcelain crowns range from $530 â€“ $1,875, with an average out of pocket cost of $950 per crown. They are less expensive than all-porcelain crowns, but more than the porcelain-over-metal crowns. The average cost of a gold crown is $900, but the prices vary if the patient has insurance.
