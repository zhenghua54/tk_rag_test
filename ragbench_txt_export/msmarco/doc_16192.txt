Baste the turkey every 45 minutes: Every 45 minutes, remove the turkey from the oven, close the oven door (don't let that heat out!), and baste the turkey all over. To baste, tilt the pan and use a turkey baster or spoon to scoop up the pan liquids and drizzle them on top of the turkey. Add liquid to the roasting pan: When ready to roast, pour two cups of broth or water into the roasting pan. Place the turkey in the oven and turn down the heat: Place the turkey in the oven and turn down the heat to 350Â°F. We recommend roasting turkeys breast-side up.
