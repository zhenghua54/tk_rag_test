A manifold absolute pressure sensor, commonly abbreviated to MAP sensor, is used in some fuel injection engines to determine the pressure in the intake manifold, and then provides a signal on engine load to the vehicleâ€™s engine control unit (ECU). In vehicles that are turbocharged or supercharged, the MAP sensor also reads the amount of boost pressure. The MAP sensor has a vacuum tube attached to the intake manifold and a vacuum or calibrated pressure area. Between them is a silicon chip that flexes due to the pressure difference between the two areas.
