Cerebrospinal fluid is formed in the choroid plexu which is a network of capillaries that project from the pia mater. Cerebrospinal fluid AKA CSF is produced in the brain by ependymal cells in the chorid plexus, though some of the CSF is produced around blood vessels and ventricle walls in th â€¦ e brain. It's not produced by the cerebellum, which controls a person's motor control functions. 4 people found this useful
