The cleaner, known as gun wash, is sprayed through the jets, much like water in a dishwasher. You can place the individual pieces of the gun directly on the jets for a faster cleaning. If you have access to a paint gun cleaning cabinet, this is the easiest method. You simply take the gun apart, place the pieces into the cabinet, and the jets spray cleaner at the parts until they are clean. It's kind of like a dishwasher for paint guns, but instead of spraying water, it sprays gun wash. After all my years of painting, there is no excuse for it, other than occasional laziness. I know cleaning your paint gun is a necessary evil, and there are a few different methods for cleaning it. The first thing to remember is to clean it right away after each use.
