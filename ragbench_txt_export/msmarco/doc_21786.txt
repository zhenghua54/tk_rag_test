Pregnyl is a preparation of human chorionic gonadotrophin obtained from the urine of pregnant women. It stimulates the steroidogenesis in the gonads by virtue of a biological effect similar to that of LH (Luteinizing hormone, which is the same as interstitial cell stimulating hormone). Pregnyl consists of a freeze-dried powder for injection. The active ingredient [human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)] which is obtained from the urine of pregnant women, has luteinizing hormone (LH) activity.
