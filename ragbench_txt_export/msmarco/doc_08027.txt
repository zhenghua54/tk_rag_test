The Indian numbering system is used in India as well as in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is based on the Vedic numbering system in which numbers over 9,999 are written in two-digit groups (or a mix of two-and three-digit groups) rather than the three-digit groups used in most other parts of the world. 1 In Telugu, a lakh is called లక్ష laksha and a crore is called కోటి koti. 2  In Urdu, a lakh is called لاکھ lākh and a crore is called کروڑ karoṛ. 3  Lakh has entered the Swahili language as  laki  and is in common use.
