Testing for AST is usually done to detect liver damage. AST levels can be examined alongside other levels of liver enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine transaminase (ALT) , to determine which form of liver disease is present. In the slowly developing variety of liver disease, chronic hepatitis, AST levels are usually not as high, often less than 4 times the highest normal level. In chronic hepatitis, AST often varies between normal and slightly increased, so doctors might request the test regularly to determine the pattern of change.
