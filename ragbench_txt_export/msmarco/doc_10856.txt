We provide personal attention to each of our customers. Our goal is to understand your needs and anticipate your requirements in advance. Many of our customers look at Gaddis Engineered Materials as a resource and extension of their own businesses. If you have a need for a part custom machined from carbon-graphite, alumina ceramic, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide or other technical ceramics, Gaddis is your source! Our products are used primarily in rotating applications such as pumps, compressors, industrial mixers and mechanical seals. You will also find Gaddis materials and components in a broad range of other applications, such as Diamond Tooling Processes, Glass & Fiberglass Manufacturing, and Specialty Textile Applications. Anywhere there is a requirement for any technical ceramic material for mechanical or thermal service, we can meet the need!
