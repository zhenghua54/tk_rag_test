The term “working memory” is often used in place of the term short-term memory because information is typically held at this level to fulfill a work function and then either forgotten or further consolidated into long-term memory. Working memory (which could also be called “memory for now”) contains all that we are conscious of and working on right now. Information is held long enough to make a decision and then either is lost or sent on to storage for later use. If it’s transferred to form a memory for later use, it becomes long-term memory.
