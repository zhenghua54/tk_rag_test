Data types apply to other things besides variables. When you assign a value to a property, that value has a data type; arguments to functions also have data types. In fact, just about anything in Visual Basic that involves data also involves data types. All variables have a data type that determines what kind of data they can store. By default, if you don't supply a data type, the variable is given the Variant data type. The Variant data type is like a chameleon â€” it can represent many different data types in different situations.
