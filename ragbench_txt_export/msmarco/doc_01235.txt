Binding Process. Library binding is a process outsourced by libraries to binding companies. The most common method used to library-bind books is called oversewing. In oversewing, the cover of the paperback's spine is removed, leaving a bundle of loose pages. Library Binding Alternatives. A cheaper way to preserve paperback books for library use in-house is known as stiffening. To stiffen a paperback book, a strip of cloth or durable material such as Tyvek is glued to the book's inside joints to reinforce the cover's attachment to the pages.
