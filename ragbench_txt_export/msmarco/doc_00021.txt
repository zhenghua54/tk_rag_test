Workers in some the world's most powerful economies also receive surprisingly low median wages, with those in China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia receiving median incomes of $1,786, $616, $4,762, and $4,129 respectively. Liberia in Africa had the lowest median income, with the typical worker earning just $118 a year
