Thank You. Go to the Control panel and select Keyboard. Select the Key settings Tab. Scroll down to Caps lock and double click it. Uncheck the box marked Displays CAPS Lock status on screen. It sounds like one of the Accessibility options has been enabled. Open Control Panel / Ease of Access Center. Select the Make the Keyboard easier to use item. Remove the check marks from Turn on Toggle Keys and Turn on Toggle Keys by holding down the NUM LOCK key for 5 seconds. Click Apply/OK. Hope this helps
