But – IF an electron group is a LONE PAIR, there is NO ATOM VISIBLE to “ Mark that Corner” of the geometry. Remember – You can only “see” the ATOMS; you CANNOT “see” the ELECTRONS. A “ group ” of electrons can be a single bond, double bond, triple bond, or a lone pair of electrons. The table below indicates the “Molecular Geometry” of the central atom depending on whether the groups of electrons around it are covalent bonds to other atoms or simply lone pairs
