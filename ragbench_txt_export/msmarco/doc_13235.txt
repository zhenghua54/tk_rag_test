If you are considering a permanent magnet DC generator then the inductor will be found at the stator with an array of permanent magnets. But in case of an AC generator the inductor is located at the rotor with an assembly of permanent magnets. A PMG reduces loses in the rotor by 20 to 30 percent. The demand for these devices is increasing day by day. With the increasing cost of electricity people are looking for an alternate source of energy and the permanent magnet generator perfectly fits in that place. These devices do not use any environmental resources to produce energy and thus are environment friendly.
