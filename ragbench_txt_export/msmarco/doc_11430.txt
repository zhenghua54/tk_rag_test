AF-C is continuous, when you focus on an object, holding it (half-)pressed, it will continue to try to keep whatever is in the focus areas in focus, whether you move or the subject moves, or you move the focus area to another subject. AF-S is single, when you focus on one object and hold it (half-)pressed, it will keep the focus where it locked. This includes any movement of you/camera, and the movement of the subject. This is used for recomposing (once you lock focus, you can rotate the camera and the object will stay in focus).
