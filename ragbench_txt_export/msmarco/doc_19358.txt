Certification is a process by which a nongovernmental agency validates, based upon predetermined standards, an individual nurse’s qualifications for practice in a defined functional or clinical area of nursing. There is an exception in the case of advanced practice licensure (for nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, midwife, etc.) — a certification exam may be used as a proxy measure for APRN licensure or designation and therefore would not be voluntary, but a requirement for licensure.
