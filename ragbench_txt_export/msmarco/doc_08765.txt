Grantic magma is rich in silica with abundant sodium and potassium. It has an extremely high viscosity and cools to form light-colored rocks. Basaltic magma is low in silica with abundant iron and magnesium. It has the lowest viscosity among the common types of magma and cools to form dark-colored rocks. Basalt is the foundation of oceanic crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock made from visible mineral crystals, a result of cooling over a longer period of time under the surface of the Earth. Another difference between basalt and granite include their joints.
