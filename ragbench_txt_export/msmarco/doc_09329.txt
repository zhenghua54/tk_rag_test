Feeding Ferrets. The American Ferret Association recommends feeding ferrets a cat food that's low in carbohydrates and no more than 20 percent fat. The content should be, at minimum, 36 percent protein. Commercial ferret foods generally are 30 percent to 40 percent animal protein and 15 percent to 20 percent fat, with no grains. Ideally, pet ferrets should eat commercial ferret food, if not a whole-prey diet. If manufactured ferret chow isn't available or if you run out, and a whole-prey diet is too gross for your comfort, feeding cat food is safe and acceptable. Ferrets and felines are both obligate carnivores -- they must eat meat. Feed ferrets a high-quality cat food with no grains or vegetables, one designed for adults or kittens. Always provide your ferret clean, fresh water
