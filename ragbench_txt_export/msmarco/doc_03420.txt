Generally, if you complete an accurate tax return, filed electronically, and requested a EFT (electronic funds transfer) where the refund amount goes directly into your bank account, your refund should be available within three weeks of your return being acknowledged and processed by the IRS. All taxpayers can check the status of their refund money via the Internet or by calling a toll-free hotline. Taxpayers must wait at least 72 hours after an electronic tax filing before they can check their refund status. Individuals who have filed via mail will need to wait at least 3 weeks after making in the form.
