If you made your request in writing for the records to be sent directly to you, the physician must provide copies to you within 15 days. The physician can charge a reasonable fee for the cost of making the copies. If you want to insure that your new doctor receives a copy of your medical records from your previous doctor, you can write your previous doctor requesting that a copy of your medical records be sent directly to you. When you receive your records, you can provide a copy of those records to any provider you choose.
