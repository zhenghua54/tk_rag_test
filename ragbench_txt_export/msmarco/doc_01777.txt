A chemical bond is the result of an attraction between atoms or ions. The types of bonds that a molecule contains will determine its physical properties, such as melting point, hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity, and solubility. (The obvious exception is in a bond between two atoms of the same element.) We say that covalent bonds are nonpolar if the electronegativity difference between the two atoms involved falls between 0 and 0.4. We say they are polar if the electronegativity difference falls between 0.4 and 1.67.
