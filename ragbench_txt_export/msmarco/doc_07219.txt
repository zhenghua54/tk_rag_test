1 This force is greater (by 0,34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). 2  This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in our rotating frame of reference. Because the Earth completes only one rotation per day, the Coriolis force is quite small, and its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean.
