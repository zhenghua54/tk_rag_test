Ballistic nylon is a thick, tough, synthetic nylon fabric used for a variety of applications. Ballistic nylon was originally developed by the DuPont corporation as a material for flak jackets to be worn by World War II airmen. Modern applications of ballistic nylon include luggage, cave packs, tool belts, police duty belts, watchstraps, motorcycle jackets, knife sheaths, and skin-on-frame kayaks. The original specification for ballistic nylon was an 18 ounce nylon fabric made from 1050 denier high tenacity nylon yarn in a 2x2 basketweave. Today the term is often used to refer to any nylon fabric that is made with a ballistic weave, typically a 2x2 or 2x3 basketweave. It can be woven from nylon yarns of various denier such as 840 denier and 1680 denier. Denier refers to the weight, not the strength, of the fabric
