Dettol is a household name associated with cleaning and disinfecting and the very name Dettol has become synonymous with antibacterial protection. And the cleanliness freak, that I am, I have always used ‘ Dettol Original Soap ’ to keep my hands clean and germ-free. Dothese, Dont use cream ,face lotion,try to use normal soap. Drink plenty of water,try to steam bath. Excercise so that sweat itself do the cleaning of ur skin insideout. Dont use too much soap ,washingtwice a day enough. Run from oily ,fried foods,especialy fast food.
