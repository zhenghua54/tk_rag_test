Some herbs do not like the fertilized loamy soil you plant them in. Despite their possible lush growth, their flavor, aroma, and medicinal strengths will suffer. Mediterranean herbs do best when allowed to struggle a little in the dry alkaline, and rocky soil of their origins, making them well suited for xeriscaping.
