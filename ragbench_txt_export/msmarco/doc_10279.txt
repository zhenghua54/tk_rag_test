If it's a model that uses regular batteries (AA, AAA, etc.), it depends on the charger. If it's an external charger, ones that monitor the battery and its temperature do so in just a couple of hours; others are overnight (12-18 hours!) chargers. Most of the Kodak (and many other chargers, for that matter) have a charge indicator that changes or extinguishes when charging is complete.
