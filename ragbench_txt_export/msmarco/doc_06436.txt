If the principal on a loan is payable within the next year, it is classified on the balance sheet as a current liability. Any other portion of the principal that is payable in more than one year is classified as a long term liability. Definition: A loan is an arrangement under which the owner of property (usually cash) allows another party the use of the property in exchange for an interest payment and the return of the property at the end of the lending arrangement.
