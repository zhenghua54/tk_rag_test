The astronomical unit (symbol au, AU or ua) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from the Earth to the Sun. This is because the distance between the Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between 6999983289891200000♠0.9832898912 and 7011152097701010286♠1.0167103335 AU) and, when the Earth is closer to the Sun (perihelion), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and the Earth is moving faster along its orbital path.
