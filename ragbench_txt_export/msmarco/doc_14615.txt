In eukaryotes, a core promoter sequence in the DNA must be present for RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Promoters are regions of DNA that promote transcription-in eukaryotes, they are found at -30, -75, and -90 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site (abbreviated to TSS). Only one of the two DNA strands serve as a template for transcription. The antisense strand of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3' end to the 5' end during transcription (3' â†’ 5').
