Glass fiber (or glass fibre) is a material consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass. Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of glass fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass (A for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A new type, E-glass, was formed; this is an alumino-borosilicate glass that is alkali This was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation.
