Prostatitis means that you have inflammation of your prostate gland. Prostatitis can be sudden-onset (acute) or persistent (chronic). It can also be caused by infection (infective) or be non-infective. Acute prostatitis is a type of infective prostatitis. It is caused by infection of the prostate gland with a germ (a bacterial infection). Chronic prostatitis can be due to long-term infection or inflammation without infection.
