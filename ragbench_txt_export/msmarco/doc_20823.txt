To flit means to moves lightly and switly, to dart about. Bees flit fom flower to flower. In the time of Alfred Lord Tennyson, -th was often put on the end of verbs, so I am guessing that Tennyson used flitteth to mean flitted or was flitting. Something like She flitteth about like a dove in a grain store.
