Hydrangeas are an old garden favorite; they are popular due to their beautiful, large, blue, pink or white blossoms. These are showy deciduous shrubs that are used as specimen plantings in landscape design. The color of the blossoms (pink or blue), is a result of the pH of the soil, whether it is acidic or alkaline. Blue Blooms. Acidic soil will produce blue blooms (also if you want your blue blooms to be bluer). To achieve a more acidic soil add sulfur or aluminum sulfate (around the plant). Apply 2 tablespoons to the soil, work it into the soil with your hand cultivator, and water well. This should be done in early fall.
