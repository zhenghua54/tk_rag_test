The blood test for albumin measures the level of albumin in the liquid portion of the blood, also known as the blood serum. Albumin is a soluble protein that is responsible for transporting certain molecules throughout the body, including hormones, vitamins, drugs and ions. The albumin blood test requires a blood sample drawn from a vein with a needle. Certain medications can increase the level of albumin in the blood, such as anabolic steroids, growth hormone, insulin and androgens.
