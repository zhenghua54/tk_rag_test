Bauxite is not a mineral, but rather a group of aluminum oxide s. The term is generally used to describe the economically important mixture of these minerals, which form a mass of the individually classified members of Gibbsite, Boehmite, and Diaspore. Bauxite is mined extensively for its economical value as the principle ore of aluminum. NOTEWORTHY LOCALITIES. Since Bauxite specimens are not well-represented in collections due to their lack of aesthetics, this guide will not list specific localities but will rather list countries that are important producers.
