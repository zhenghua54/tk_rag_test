RE: What is the difference between Penne and Mostaccioli? Is mostaccioli a type of noodle or is penne the type of noodle used to make the dish mostaccioli? If they are two different type of noodles, what is the difference? Mostaccioli is popular in the Campagnia region of Southern Italy and is usually a little large than penne. Both penne and mostaccioli can be smooth (lisce) or ridged (rigate).
