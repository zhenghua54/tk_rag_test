The NPRM proposed to apply the requirement for a child restraint anchorage system to passenger cars, and to trucks, multipurpose passenger vehicles and buses under 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The lower anchorage points for the CAUSFIX were positioned 280 mm (11 inches) apart on the test seat structure, with the inboard anchorage approximately 610 mm (24 inches) from the inner surface of the door. An instrumented 9-month-old dummy was used in all the tests.
