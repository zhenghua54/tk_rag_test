Cotton balls can be soaked in peppermint oil, and then placed near areas known for mice activity. Cayenne pepper may be sprinkled near mice entries, and ammonia placed in plastic bottle caps can be placed in cupboards where mice are known to visit. The odor of a housecat has also been known to repel mice. Many commercial mice repellents exist.
