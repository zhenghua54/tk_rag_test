Marble is a metamorphic rock that comes from metamorphosed limestone or dolomite. Limestone is mostly calcite or calcium carbonate, CaCO 3. Dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2 is related to limestone but is rich in magnesium. Marble has a uniform texture (non-foliated). There is a lot of variation in the color and texture of marble. The two main influences are the kind of limestone that makes up the parent rock and the kind and degree of metamorphism.
