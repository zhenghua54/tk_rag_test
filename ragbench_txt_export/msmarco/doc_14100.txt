Venison backstrap is a cut of meat from a deer. On a whole deer, the backstraps run along the length of the spine. The backstrap is considered one of the most tender cuts of meat on a deer because the muscle itself is rarely used. In general, the more a muscle is used, the tougher it becomes. There are several different methods of removing the backstraps from a deer. Butter or bacon fat are sometimes used as coatings for lean cuts of meat to prevent overcooking. There are several ways of preparing and cooking venison backstrap. As a general rule, any recipe for beef or pork tenderloin can be used for venison, as long as the cooking times are adjusted for size and fat content.
