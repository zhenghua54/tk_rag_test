Most words in any language are symbols. For instance, the word apple neither looks nor sounds like an apple (how would an apple sound, anyway?). The relation between the word-symbol apple and the fruit it signifies is arbitrary, established by a convention handed down by word of mouth in a given speech community. For instance, the octagonal shape of a stop sign is a symbol, as is the white and red striped pole which signifies a barber shop. The shape of most numerical digits is arbitrary: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. (although one could argue that the shape of the digit 1 is somewhat iconic). 2.
