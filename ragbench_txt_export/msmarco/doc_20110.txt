Micturition reflex is the neurological pathways involved in urination. When your bladder fills, the detrusor muscles expand and proprioceptors within the walls of the muscle â€¦ activate. It sends signals (afferent nerves) that go to your medulla and also to the parasympathetic system in the sacral spinal cord. The terms micturition, voiding and emiction all refer to urination, the passage of urine from the bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. 2 people found this useful.
