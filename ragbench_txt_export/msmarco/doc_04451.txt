Dissolve Rust with Vinegar. Plain white vinegar can be an effective substance for cleaning rust off metal. You can pour or rub vinegar directly on metal items that have become rusty, or soak small items in a container filled with the clear liquid. When the vinegar starts to dissolve the rust, simply wipe the surface clean and rinse with cold water. Remove Rust with Baking Soda. Add water to baking soda to form a thick paste, being careful that the consistency is not runny at all. Use your fingers or a flat spreader to apply the paste to the rusty surface.
