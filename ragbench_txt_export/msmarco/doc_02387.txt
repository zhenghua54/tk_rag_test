Polybutylene (polybutene-1, poly(1-butene) , PB-1) is a polyolefin or saturated polymer with the chemical formula (C 4 H 8) n. It should not be confused with polybutene, a low molecular weight oligomer. Polybutylene is produced by polymerisation of 1-butene using supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts. PB-1 is a high molecular weight, linear, isotactic, and semi-crystalline polymer
