1. Use a light-action rod with 4 to 6 pound test line. This is the best rod to use for trout fishing and allows you to use a variety of techniques to catch your trout. The lighter line has less friction with the water, allowing you cast your line to the very bottom of the lake with ease. 1  Some lake trout can be over 35 pounds, you will need a heavier rod for these. 2. Try jigging for trout. This technique is best in areas where fish are concentrated, so you might want to try it if you're fishing a well-stocked lake. Use a spoon jig or a white buck-tail jig, and bait with a minnow or a piece of sucker meat.
