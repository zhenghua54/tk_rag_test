Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes problems primarily in the joints, but can cause symptoms throughout the body. Inflammation of the finger joints causes stretching of the ligaments and tendons. This leads to the erosion of bone and cartilage and deformity of the joints.
