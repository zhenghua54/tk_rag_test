Cellular Respiration vs Fermentation. Respiration is a vital way for the cells of plants and animals to obtain and utilize energy. Without this energy, cells in the bodies of plants and animals would fail to function and will eventually break down and die. 5. ATP production in cellular respiration is slower than in fermentation. 6. The energy produced in fermentation can be used when energy production in cellular respiration slows down due to insufficient oxygen supply. 7.
