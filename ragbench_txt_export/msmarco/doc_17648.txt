Training to Become a CRNA. Before becoming a certified registered nurse anesthetist, a nurse must have at least one year of experience in an acute care setting, such as an emergency room or critical care unit, and complete additional training in a large hospital setting. Nurse anesthetists are required to have a Bachelor's of Science degree in nursing or other appropriate undergraduate degree and a master's degree from one of the more than 100 graduate schools of nurse anesthesia.
