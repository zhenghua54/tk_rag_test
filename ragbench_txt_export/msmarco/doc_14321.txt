Post 2. I don't usually drink bottled water or tap water, because the water that we drink from tap water or bottled water is very acidic which is bad for our health. The water I drink is from a machine that takes the acid out of the water and turns it very alkaline, which is good for our health. He prefers buying distilled water in big containers and drinking that instead of tap water. To me, distilled water has a strange taste that almost reminds me of vinegar with a hint of sweetness. I feel that water should be totally flavorless, and since my tap water is, I prefer to drink it.
