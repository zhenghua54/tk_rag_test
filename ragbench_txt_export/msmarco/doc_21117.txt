Rock shrimp has a texture and flavor like lobster. Answer: Rock shrimp (Sicyonia brevirostris) have a hard, spiny shell more like a lobster rather than its shrimp cousins. The shell is hard as a rock, hence the term rock shrimp. They live and spawn in warm deep waters, 120 to 240 feet. Keep in mind that rock shrimp cook faster than shrimp, so keep an eye on them. To boil, add to boiling water, stir, and remove after 35 seconds. Immediately rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Split rock shrimp may be broiled about 2 minutes, until the flesh turns opaque.
