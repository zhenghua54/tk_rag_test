Iron(II) sulfate (British English: iron(II) sulphate) or ferrous sulfate is a salt with the formula Fe SO4. In the second half of the 1850s ferrous sulfate was used as a photographic developer for collodion process images. Ferrous sulfate is sometimes added to the cooling water flowing through the brass tubes of turbine condensers to form a corrosion-resistant protective coating.
