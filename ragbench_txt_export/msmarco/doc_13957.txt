Gastroparesis is a disorder that occurs when the stomach takes too long to empty the food inside. This disorder, also known as delayed gastric emptying, is a result of weak or abnormal muscles in the stomach. Right now thereâ€™s no cure for gastroparesis, but treatment can help you manage your symptoms. If your gastroparesis is caused by a condition like diabetes, the first step is to improve control of that underlying condition. After that, your doctor may recommend medication, diet changes, and even surgery in some cases.
