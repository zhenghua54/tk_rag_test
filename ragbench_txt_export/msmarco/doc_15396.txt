FABRICS WE USE: Our most popular fabric is 118 wide white Voile drapery sheer. This fabric is the standard for quality ceiling draping. It is flameproof rated, durable and versatile enough to create many different styles of drape design. We can also incorporate other types of fabrics as accents, or do your entire design with a custom color fabric. A good draping design will positively transform the atmosphere of your site and enhance your theme. It can help mask unsightly elements like poorly maintained ceilings and unfortunate ceiling fixtures.
