Your descriptions aren't like any Tizer, Irn Bru or Dr Pepper drinks I've ever had... Tizer and Dr Pepper are quality, Irn Bru is icky though. Quote: Originally Posted by Eye2006.

I also used to like Cream Soda, but I can't seem to find any of these (except Dr. Pepper) in a diet version-especially the Cream Soda, which is really annoying!
