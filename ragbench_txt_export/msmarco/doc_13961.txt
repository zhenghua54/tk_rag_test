Courts can eliminate potential jurors who are not willing to vote for the death penalty in a capital case (“death qualification”). Views on the death penalty correlate to some degree with race, gender, and religious beliefs. The Project also found that 44% of jurors believed the death penalty was required if the defendant's conduct was heinous, vile or depraved, even though the Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty cannot be required because specific aggravating circumstances have been established.
