Posted on. by admin. Transformation vs Transduction. Conjugation is a well-known method of DNA recombination, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Later on scientists found that DNA can transfer from one bacterial cell to another by another two mechanisms; namely, transformation and transduction. Similar to conjugation, these two mechanisms transfer DNA in one direction and recombination occur between alleles in homologous DNA regions.
