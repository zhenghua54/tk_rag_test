Both cholera and typhoid fever are transmitted via fecally contaminated drinking water. They are diarrheal diseases caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella enterica, respectively. Both cholera and typhoid can cause severe, life-threatening dehydration (CDC). Children suffering from cholera or typhoid can contaminate the water when they swim and play in the lake. When members of the community collect and drink the contaminated water, they are exposed to the bacteria that cause cholera and typhoid.
