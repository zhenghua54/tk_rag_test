The active ingredient in Dettol liquid is an aromatic chemical compound known as chloroxylenol, which makes up 4.8 percent of Dettol's total solution. The remainder is a mixture of pine oil, isopropanol, castor oil soap, caramel and water. Dettol is also commonly used in Australia to kill cane toads, which are a pest species. When toads are sprayed or wiped with the liquid, the Dettol is rapidly absorbed through the toad's skin, causing death.
