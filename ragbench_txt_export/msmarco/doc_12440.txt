High levels of triglycerides and uric acid have each been reported to be independently associated with an elevated risk for coronary heart disease. However, it is less well established whether high levels or triglycerides or uric acid, per se, represent independent cardiovascular risk factors. Rather, both hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia serve as biomarkers for increased coronary heart disease risk. Thus, although there is no direct relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and high uric acid levels, they are linked by a common denominator: a diet enriched in fructose.
