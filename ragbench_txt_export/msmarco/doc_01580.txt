1 Germ cells have only half the number of chromosomes as a diploid cell Â­ one of each pair-and are termed haploid (n) . 2  In a human egg or sperm, there are 23 chromosomes, one of which is an X or Y. 3  The number of chromosomes is reduced from 46 to 23 during the process of meiosis. Summary: At the end of meiosis, 4 daughter cells are formed = eggs or sperm. Each contains half as many chromosomes as the parent cell (n); each cell is genetically different from its parents and from its siblings. Fertilization of an egg by a sperm restores the chromosome number to 2n.
