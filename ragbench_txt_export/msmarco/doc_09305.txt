Lesotho's currency, the Loti (LSL) (plural Maloti), is fixed at a 1:1 ratio with the South African Rand (ZAR). South African currency is accepted everywhere â€” there is no need to change money. However you will get Maloti in change (unless you ask) which is very difficult to unload in South Africa.
