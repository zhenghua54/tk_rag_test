Glass Type. The amount of weight your shelf can safely hold depends on the type of glass. Typically, manufacturers use only toughened glass for shelves, casings and other architectural purposes, since decorative glass, such as cathedral or obscure glass, aren’t strong enough to support much weight. Annealed glass shelves ¼-inch thick won’t hold anything heavier than about 70 pounds, even with a lot of strong supports. Tempered glass can hold significantly more weight, but usually glass shelves this thin are completely safe only for lightweight bric-a-brac and other small decorative items.
