no comments. Ginkgo biloba is a popular herb, with a reputation for improving memory and blood flow. Lately, however, we’ve discovered that it also may have benefits in skin care products. You’ll find ginkgo in my Anti-Aging Facial Oil, Serum, and Eye Cream. Extracts from ginkgo leaves have also shown anti-inflammatory properties, which could help reduce the occurrence of acne and other skin concerns like rosacea and eczema. Taken orally, ginkgo was also shown in one study to enhance the skin’s ability to produce fibroblasts, which are responsible for collagen production.
