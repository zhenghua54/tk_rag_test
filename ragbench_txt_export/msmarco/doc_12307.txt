Antibody titer is a laboratory test that measures the level of antibodies in a blood sample. The antibody level in the blood tells your doctor whether or not you have been exposed to an antigen or something that the body thinks is foreign. The body uses antibodies to attack and remove foreign substances. The antibody titer is also used to determine: 1  The strength of an immune response to the body's own tissue in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune disorders. 2  If you need a booster immunization. 3  Whether a previous vaccine helped your immune system protect you against the specific disease.
