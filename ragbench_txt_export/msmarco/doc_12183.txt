For your pork loin you are looking for an internal temperature of no more than 145 degrees. When you take the roast out of the oven it will continue to cook for a while (that's called carry over) and after resting for 15 - 20 minutes it will reach the perfect temperature of 150 - 155 degrees. For a pork loin roast @ 275 degrees, cooking time is about. one hour and 45 minutes. My personal favorite temperature is cooking @ 225 degrees.. Think about it as the way BBQ Pit Masters ply their trade.
