According to Consumer Reports testing, annual operating costs for the most efficient 4.4-cubic-foot mini fridge can be as low as $27, while a much larger 20.6-cubic-foot refrigerator costs just $47 per year. A compact refrigerator, often referred to as a mini fridge, is commonly used for extra food cooling in home bars, kids' or bonus rooms, home offices and dorm rooms. It's easy to assume that small refrigerators equate to small energy consumption, but this is not typically the case.
