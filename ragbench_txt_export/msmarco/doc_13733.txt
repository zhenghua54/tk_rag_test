Pull out the racks and set them aside. Wipe down the interior with a damp cloth or sponge, cleaning away the grease and softened food deposits. Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda into a small bowl and add enough water to make a thick paste. Apply the paste to any areas where baked-on food or debris remains. Allow the baking soda to sit for 30 minutes and then scrub gently with an old toothbrush.
