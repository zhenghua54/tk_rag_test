Water cantaloupe seedlings until the first 1 or 2 inches of the soil feels moist. Cantaloupes typically need 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Water less when fruits start to ripen for better flavor. 3. Plan to transplant cantaloupe seedlings when they reach about 2 inches in height and have two or more true leaves. Transplant when all danger of frost has passed and daytime temperatures range between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
