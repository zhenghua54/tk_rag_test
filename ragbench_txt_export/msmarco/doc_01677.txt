1 A terrazzo floor has a high initial price, but can last for generations with no replacement costs. 2  Professionally installed poured-in-place terrazzo can cost $20-$50 a square foot ($8,000-$20,000 for a 20'x20'; $40,000-$100,000 for 2,000 square feet) but can go as high as $60-$80 or more a square foot. 1 A do-it-yourself poured terrazzo installation project is challenging but not impossible, and material costs can be minimal. 2  A Florida homeowner used white cement, fine sand, scraps from a marble wholesaler, a small rock crusher and a homemade grinder to set his own terrazzo floors for about $200.
