The Holocaust did not happen suddenly, it was the end of a long process of anti-Semitism. The Nazis had come to power in 1933, and used propaganda and terror to enforce their anti-Semitic policies. Laws were passed by the Nazis called the Nuremburg Laws. These laws took away all the human rights of Jews.
