Regenerator-Device that restores a degraded digital signal for continued transmission; also called arepeater. SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) - The ITU-T-defined world standard of transmissionwhose base transmission level is 52 Mbps (STM-0) and is equivalent to SONET's STS-1 or OC-1transmission rate. Synchronous Digital Hierarchy is a world standard, and as such, SONETcan be considered a subset of SDH.Transmission standards in the United States, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong (ANSI) and therest of the world (ITU-T, formerly CCITT) evolved from different basic-rate signals in thenon-synchronous hierarchy.
