MCI Worldcom dissolved a previous alliance with the Internet search engine Yahoo when MCI sold off its Internet business to Britain's Cable and Wireless for $1.75 billion and closed its merger with Worldcom. The new service allows MCI Worldcom to re-enter the consumer Internet business that the MCI Communications Corporation exited last year. MCI sold its Internet operations to gain regulatory approval for its $40 billion acquisition by Worldcom Inc. last September.
