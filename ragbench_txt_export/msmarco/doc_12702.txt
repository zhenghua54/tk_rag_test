Place the chicken underneath a piece of plastic wrap. Use a small mallet (metal or wood) and gently pound the chicken thighs. Make sure that each of the thighs is of equal thickness, around 1/2 inch-3/4 inch. This will not only make your chicken more tender, but will allow you to cook the chicken evenly. Get out a large enough baking pan to fit all of the chicken thighs you plan to cook. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter to the pan. Spread it out evenly, so that your chicken will not stick to the pan. This will get your chicken brown and crispy.
