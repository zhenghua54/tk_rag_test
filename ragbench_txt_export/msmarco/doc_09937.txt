Concrete construction unit cost for installation of concrete footings for a foundation or retaining wall. This cost covers the cost per volume for any size of footing. Use it in combination with the footing cost per foot. NOTE -- This is half of a two-part unit cost that covers any footing size. Goldenseal also includes one-part unit costs for footings in two common sizes, 6x16 and 8x24.
