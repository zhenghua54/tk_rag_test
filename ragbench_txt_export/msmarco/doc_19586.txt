(Fortune Small Business) -- David Neeleman, founder of Brazil's new Azul Airlines, is seated in the back of his armored Ford Fusion, stopped in a rush-hour traffic jam between the airport and his office in Sao Paulo. Azul leases two JetBlue planes, and even the name Azul-Portuguese for blue-is either a tribute to his old company or a swipe at it. Samba won a name-the-company contest that yielded 157,000 entries, but Neeleman selected the moniker that came in second.
