Common examples include oxycodone, hydrocodone and hydromorphone. Opioids are primarily used in medicine for the treatment of pain. The side effects of opioids include sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and a strong sense of euphoria. The term opioid was first used in the early 1960s. Its basic meaning is opiate-like (opiates being a set of narcotic drugs derived from opium), and many sources do not define it more explicitly than that.
