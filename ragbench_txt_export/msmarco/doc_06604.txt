It is important to understand the difference between tidal power and wave power before we continue. Tides are created by the gravity of the moon and to a lesser extent the sun. As you may know the waves can be felt beneath the water, as well as the surface. The generator uses the push of the wave, underneath the water, and turns it into electricity. One weeks worth of this energy could power the whole of the UK for 5 days. this includes all the wi-fi, electronics, TV, Sounds etcâ€¦..
