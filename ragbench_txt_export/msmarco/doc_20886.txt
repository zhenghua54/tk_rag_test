The terms Eskimo and Inuit are frequently used interchangeably, however the term Inuit does not properly include the Alutiiq, Inupiaq, Sug'piak, and Yup'ik Eskimo populations of Alaska, or the Yupik population of Eastern Russia. “Inuit” refers to Arctic Native populations in Canada. Inuit, meaning people, is used in most of Canada, and the language is called Inuktitut in eastern Canada although other local designations are used also. The Inuit people of Greenland refer to themselves as Greenlanders or Kalaallit in their language, which they call Greenlandic or Kalaallisut..
