Osteoclast functions. An osteoclast is a multinucleated cell, derived from cells in bone marrow, that breaks down bone matrix. Osteoclasts function by moving along a bone surface, channeling grooves with lysosomeal enzymes, breaking down the bone matrix. There are three types of bone cells in bone marrow. Unless you have a fracture or a disease like osteoporosis, your physician may never talk about osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes.
