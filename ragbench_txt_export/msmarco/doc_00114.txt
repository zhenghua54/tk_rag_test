If you're going to your first professional interview, or haven't been to one in a while, you might be wondering how long it will last. The person doing the interviewing will obviously guide the interview and determine how much time it will take. If you're the job candidate, you probably won't know exactly how long the interview will take, but in many cases, the interviewer may not know, either. The type of interview may affect its length.
