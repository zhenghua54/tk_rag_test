Edwards syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 18th chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 18) or in part (such as due to translocations). The additional chromosome usually occurs before conception. It is the second-most common autosomal trisomy, after Down syndrome, that carries to term. Edwards syndrome occurs in around one in 6,000 live births, and around 80% of those affected are female. The majority of fetuses with the syndrome die before birth. The incidence increases as the mother's age increases.
