A financial manager is in charge of the functions involving money in a large or small organization. While answerable to corporate management or a board of directors, he or she holds authority over decisions regarding income, costs, payroll, investments, mergers, and acquisitions. A financial manager typically works closely with other members of the management team on matters that can affect the financial health of the organization. Financial managers often lead teams of accountants.
