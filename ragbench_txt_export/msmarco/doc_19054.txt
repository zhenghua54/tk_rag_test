If your display has a DVI connection, but your laptop only has a VGA connection, you need to use a video converter that converts VGA into DVI. Newer laptops may also have a DisplayPort, which can be used to connect external display devices that utilize a DisplayPort cable. An example of a VGA connector for a computer monitor and VGA port on a laptop is shown to the right. Once connected, your laptop may automatically switch to the new external display, or you may be required to press a key or keys on the keyboard to switch to the external display.
