Published January 18, 2013 | By Larry Stephens. The beard of a turkey is a curious oddity. Actually, it is not a beard or hair at all. It is a modified feather that forms kind of a stiff bristle. Since the cluster of bristles resembles a beard of sorts, people began referring to it as a beard. By the next spring he will be a 2 year old and sport a beard up to 9-10″. Beards over 10″ are typically found on birds of 3 years or older though few toms will grow a beard longer than 11-11 1/2″. A Wide Eastern (left), Thin Osceola (right). 1  Non-Typical Turkeys!
