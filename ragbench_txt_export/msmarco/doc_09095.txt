Another possible answer to the question, 'Who invented the first steam engine and in what year ?' is Thomas Savery in 1698. That's the year in which Savery (1650 - 1715), an English military engineer, patented a device to remove water from coal mines using steam. Thomas Newcomen (1663 - 1729) is a third candidate for recognition as 'the one who invented the steam engine .' He built the first atmospheric steam engine as an improvement over Savery's device for removing water from coal mines. Newcomen's steam engine is shown in the illustration at the left.
