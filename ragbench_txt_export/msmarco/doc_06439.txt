Increase in Notes Payable. When a business takes on a new loan or note, it increases the notes payable account on the balance sheet. This boosts its cash flow because it received money from the loan. A business reports this amount as a cash inflow in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. A note payable is a debt that is established with a written agreement, such as a bank loan. The notes payable account in the liabilities section of the balance sheet represents the total amount a business owes on these particular debts.
