covalent bond, a chemical bond that forms by the sharing of two electrons between atoms. A double bond is formed when four electrons are shared between two atoms; a triple bond is formed when six electrons are shared between two atoms. n chemical bond that involves sharing of electrons between atoms of the same element to give a molecule of that element (e.g., nitrogen) or atoms of two or more elements to give a molecule of a compound (e.g., carbon dioxide); the predominant type of bonding in organic chemistry.
