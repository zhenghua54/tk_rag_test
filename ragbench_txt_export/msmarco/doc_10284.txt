The English language is heavily stressed with each word divided into syllables. English is classed as a ‘stress-based’ language, which means the meanings of words can be altered significantly by a change in stress. This is why it is important to develop an understanding of English syllables and stress patterns. When the word ‘present’ is pronounced ‘ pre sent’, with the stress on the first syllable, the word means ‘a gift’ (which is a noun) or ‘here / not absent’ (an adjective). But when the word is pronounced ‘pre sent’ , with the stress on the second syllable, the word now means ‘to present’ something or someone (a verb).
