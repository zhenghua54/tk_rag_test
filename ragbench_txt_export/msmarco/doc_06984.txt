Reduced Benefits. If your extra income is from a job, then the first $85 each month of earned income is not counted against you. After that, your monthly disability benefit will be reduced $1 for every $2 of earned income above the $85. You then divide this amount in half to get $407.50. This is the amount that your disability benefit will be reduced that month. If you are generally earning more than $700 a month or $8,400 a year, you will be earning too much to be eligible for benefits.
