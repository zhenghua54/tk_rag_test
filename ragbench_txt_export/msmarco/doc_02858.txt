The appearance, as well as the thickness of the endometrium, will depend on whether the patient is of reproductive age or post-menopausal and, if of reproductive age, at what point in the menstrual cycle they are examined. The endometrium should be measured in the long axis or sagittal plane. Endometrial thickness is a commonly measured parameter on routine gynaecological ultrasound and MR imaging.
