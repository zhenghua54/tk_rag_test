For example, if your ceiling is 10 feet in height and your ceiling fan is 12 inches in height, you will need a 1-foot downrod to mount the ceiling fan 8 feet above the floor. The wrong height can also result in an ill-fitted looking ceiling fan. A method commonly used to find the right downrod length is the ceiling height minus the height of the ceiling fan, minus the desired hanging height (usually 8 feet).
