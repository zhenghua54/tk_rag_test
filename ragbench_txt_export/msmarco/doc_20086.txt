The Differences Between a Felony and a Misdemeanor. The main difference between a felony and a misdemeanor is the severity of the crime. What is considered to be a severe crime will vary from society to society and, sometimes, from state to state. Both felonies and misdemeanors can be committed against people, property, or the state. Once again, though, the difference is the severity of the crime. Because state legislatures and Congress define what constitutes a felony and a misdemeanor, crimes that fit into each category may differ somewhat from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general, felonies are reserved for more serious crimes and entail more serious punishments.
