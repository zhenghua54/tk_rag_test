MRI can look at the spine in the neck (cervical), upper back (thoracic), or lower back (lumbosacral). The entire spine can be seen in one series of pictures to find a tumor. More detailed pictures of one area, such as the lumbar spine, may be taken. MRI may be used to check low back problems. In some cases, a contrast material may be used during the MRI to show certain parts of the body more clearly. The MRI can find changes in the spine and in other tissues. It also can find problems such as infection or a tumor.
