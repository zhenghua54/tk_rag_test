There are two basic types of compounds. They are distinguished by by the manner in which the atoms bind to one another in the compound. These two types are called molecular compounds and salts (or equivalently ionic compounds): Molecular compounds: These compounds are made up of molecules whose atoms bind to one another through covalent bonds. Salts: The atoms in salts are held together with ionic bonds. Unlike molecules, salts always form solids in a regular array called a crystalline solid.
