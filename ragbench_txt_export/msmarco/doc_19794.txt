cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a broadening of behavior therapy to include consideration of cognitive processes and use specific techniques for teaching cognitive skills that help the patient adaptively perceive, interpret, and respond to the environment. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable for some patients. Those who do not have a specific behavioral issue they wish to address and whose goals for therapy are to gain insight into the past may be better served by psychodynamic therapy.
