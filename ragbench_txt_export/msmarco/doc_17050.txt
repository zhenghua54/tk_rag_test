cherubim. Biblical cherubim (the word is the plural of cherub) were not the chubby children later Western tradition has made them. They were fearsome half-animal half-human creatures, often with lion's bodies and spread wings. They served as guards (Gen 3:24) and those on the lid of the ark were thought of as Adonai's throne.
