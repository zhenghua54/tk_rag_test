DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, while RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. DNA, thus, carries a deoxyribose sugar and RNA contains a ribose sugar. DNA is composed of several types of nitrogenous bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. RNA contains nitrogenous bases similar to DNA, but does not contain thymine. It contains uracil instead.
