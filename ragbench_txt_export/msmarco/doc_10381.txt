Hemoglobin C trait (hemoglobin C carrier) occurs when a person inherits one gene for hemoglobin C and one gene for hemoglobin A. Individuals with hemoglobin C trait are NOT at risk to develop sickle cell disease or hemoglobin C disease. They generally do NOT have any medical problems and lead normal lives.
