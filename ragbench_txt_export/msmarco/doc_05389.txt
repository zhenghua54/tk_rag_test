Occupational therapy is a health and rehabilitation profession. Occupational therapists work with people of all ages who need specialized assistance to lead independent, productive, and satisfying lives due to physical, developmental, social, or emotional problems. Occupational science studies how activities meet the needs of individuals and communities, and provide meaning and purpose to life; how activity produces changes in the individual and different patterns of occupation. This is similar to how sociology is applied in social work, and biology applied in medicine.
