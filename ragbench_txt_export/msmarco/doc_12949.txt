Concrete gets progressively harder over time its called curing. However it depends on several thing like temperature and moisture. You can typically walk on concrete the next day but it can be prone to scratching. I generally have my customers wait two days to walk on it and 7-10 days to drive. In summer time on hot days concrete can cure to fast and crack within hours.
