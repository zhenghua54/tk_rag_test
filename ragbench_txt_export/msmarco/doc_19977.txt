Kabbage gives you the security of working capital whenever you need it. Draw against your line of credit, as often as once a day, for anything you need to grow your business. Unlike traditional lenders, we approve small business loans by looking at real-life data, not just a credit score. Go to Kabbage Blog. Kabbage can approve you in minutes when we are able to automatically obtain your business data and instantly verify your bank account. In some situations errors may occur during the sign up process, or we may need to send micro-deposits to confirm your bank account for security purposes.
