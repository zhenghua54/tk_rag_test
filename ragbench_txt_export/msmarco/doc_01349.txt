North Carolina law allows a judgment creditor to try to collect on its judgment for ten years; in addition, creditors holding judgments can petition the court which entered the judgment to renew the judgment before the initial ten years expires. Let us assume for a moment the judgment-creditor has a judgment against you that was given in 1997. (In other words, for the sake of argument let us say you were a party to the lawsuit against your spouse.) The statute of limitations for judgments in North Carolina is 10 years.
