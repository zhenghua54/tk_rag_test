Comparing the European Commission (EC) to the European Union (EU) is like telling how the Presidentâ€™s office or the executive branch differs from the broader presidential/democratic form of government. This is because the EC is part of the bigger EU. The European Commission, otherwise known simply as the Commission, acts as the executive branch that can propose legislation that serves for the benefit of the entire continent. It is also responsible for the usual, day-to-day operations of the Union. It has 27 commissioners collectively known as the College.
