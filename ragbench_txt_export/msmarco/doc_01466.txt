Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas. It affects the radiation budget of Earth directly (by intercepting heat radiation) but also indirectly, by reacting with other trace gases in the atmosphere, and by delivering water molecules upon oxidation in the stratosphere. Methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere; a molecule of methane is oxidized to water and carbon dioxide within a decade or so, mainly by reaction with another trace gas, the hydroxyl radical OH-.
