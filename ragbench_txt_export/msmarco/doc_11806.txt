Mexican Mole Lizard. Mexican Mole Lizards, or Ajolotes, are reptiles that meld the comical, the creepy and maybe even the cute to create... confusion. They sort of remind me of the Turtle Frog, which turns out to be quite reasonable because they both spend their lives digging through the earth. Mexican Mole Lizards aren't really lizards at all but they are a relation, and so too are snakes. These Ajolotes have a genus to themselves called Bipes, referring to their two legs.
