Overview. The brightness temperature is a measurement of the radiance of the microwave radiation traveling upward from the top of the atmosphere to the satellite, expressed in units of the temperature of an equivalent black body. Brightness temperature (also referred to as TB) is a measure of the radiance of microwave radiation traveling upward from the top of Earth's atmosphere. The conversion from radiometer counts to top-of-the-atmosphere TB is called the calibration process
