I think that the rhubarb flower stalk or seedpod is a very beautiful sight, and I really dislike the idea of removing it, however it must be cut out. Scroll down for directions on how to remove the flower stalk. The flower head that comes up from rhubarb plants should be removed immediately when you first observe it. This flower or seedpod usually comes up in the springtime. These flower stalks do not usually grow on younger plants, but are common on more mature plants that are 3 or more years older. If you do not cut the flower stalk off as low as possible, it may begin to rot and provide a home to slugs and other insects which may in turn damage the rhubarb plants.
