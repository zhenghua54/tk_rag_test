Biogas is commonly made from animal manure, sludge settled from wastewater, and at landfills containing organic wastes. However, biogas can also be made from almost any feedstock containing organic compounds, both wastes and biomass (energy crops). Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are all readily converted to biogas. Biogas is principally a mixture of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) along with other trace gases. Biogas can be collected from landfills, covered lagoons, or enclosed tanks called anaerobic digesters.
