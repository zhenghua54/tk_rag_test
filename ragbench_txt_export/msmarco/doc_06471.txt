For example, the same 8-inch Parrott rifle was referred to as a 200-pounder by the army and a 150-pounder in the navy. The confusion existed because the original 200 pound projectile had been shortened, thus reducing the weight to 150 pounds. The navy carried the new designation while the army retained the older. The 10-inch Parrott was known as a 300-pounder, even though it actually fired a shell weighing about 250 pounds.
