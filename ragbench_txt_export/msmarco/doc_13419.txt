My name is Jena Marie. I love my name! 'Jena' also can mean 'white, fair, smooth' in Cornish, 'little bird' in English, and 'white wave' in Welsh (from Jenny/Jennifer/Gwenhwyfar). It is a variant of Jenny, which is a diminutive of Jane and Jennifer. In Scandinavian, it means 'God is gracious'. (Note that the Scandinavian name 'Jena' is for a boy)
