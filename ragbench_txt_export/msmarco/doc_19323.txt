Probably not. But using Xanax use outside of a prescription is illegal as Xanax is a Schedule IV benzodiazepine under the Controlled Substances Act. Still, Xanax is not a medical narcotic. Furthermore, if you are taking Xanax without a prescription or are using Xanax other than prescribed your risk of Xanax addiction increases. Xanax addiction risk is further increased in people with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.
