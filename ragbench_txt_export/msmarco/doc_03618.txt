Sen. John Sherman (R – OH), the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 – 7) is a landmark federal statute in the history of United States antitrust law (or  competition law ) passed by Congress in 1890. See also: United States antitrust law and Competition law. The Sherman Act has seen much controversy. One branch of the criticism focuses on whether the Act improves competition and benefits consumers, or merely aids inefficient businesses at the expense of more innovative ones.
