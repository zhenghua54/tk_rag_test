Elvis Aaron Presley (8 January 1935 â€“ 16 August 1977) was an American singer, musician, and actor. He was one of the most popular American singers of the 20th century. One of the most significant cultural icons, he is widely known by the single name Elvis. 1 A few months later, Elvis was back; this time, his voice was even stronger but he looked worse; two months later, he was dead and that's when my family and I went to see him, one last time, in a memorable trip where we and thousands of others, walked slowly through those gates to view his grave.
