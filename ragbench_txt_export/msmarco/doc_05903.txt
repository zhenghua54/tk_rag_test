California strawberries are packed with vital nutrients. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin with potent antioxidant capabilities essential for many biological functions, most notably ensuring proper wound healing and maintaining cartilage. One serving of eight medium strawberries provides 160 percent of the recommended Daily Value. Potassium is an important nutrient to balance electrolytes, aid muscle contractions, and maintain a healthy blood pressure. Diets rich in potassium can lower blood pressure by buffering the effects of sodium on blood pressure. One serving, or eight medium strawberries, provides three grams of fiber, making this fruit a good source of dietary fiber. Antioxidants are key to warding off chronic diseases and promoting optimum health. Research shows that the antioxidants in strawberries are efficiently absorbed within one hour after being eaten.
