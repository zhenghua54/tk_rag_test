The cost of labor can be a BIG factor in cost per sqft. It isn't just labor to build but labor to stock and deliver materials. I don't know how many hours ir takes to build the average house, but 1000 hours at $10/hr is $10,000. At $40/hr it would be $40,000. For a 1500 sqft house that's about $7/sqft vs $28/sqft for labor costs. If it took over 1,000 hrs, the difference would be even greater.
