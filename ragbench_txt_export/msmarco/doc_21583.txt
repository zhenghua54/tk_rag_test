1 Nose tip surgery concentrates on the soft parts of your nose, and takes approximately 1 hour under general anaesthetic. 2  The plastic surgeon modifies the cartilages inside the tip of your nose and he uses dissolvable stitches on completion, thus avoiding the need for removal after healing. After the nose surgery you are taken every 2–3 days for a free check up to the clinic. Minimum stay in Prague is 7 days after surgery, recommended 10–14 days. Our Prague rhinoplasty surgeons use dissolving stitches, which are placed inside of your nose and do not need to be removed.
