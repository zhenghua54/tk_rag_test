The aircraft powerplant. The airplane engine and propeller, often referred to as the aircraft powerplant, work in combination to produce thrust. The powerplant propels the airplane and drives the various systems that support the operation of an airplane. The fuel must be available to the engine under all conditions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and during all approved flight maneuvers. Two common classifications apply to fuel systems in small airplanes-gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems.
