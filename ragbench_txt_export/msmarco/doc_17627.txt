Arteries carry blood that contains oxygen to the parts of the body, including the brain. The flow of blood through the arteries can stop if the artery is blocked. This handout looks at what occurs when a stroke happens in the left middle cerebral artery in the brain. The middle cerebral artery divides into a right middle cerebral artery and a left middle cerebral artery.
