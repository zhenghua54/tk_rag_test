Soil Texture. Avocado trees grow best in a loose soil made up of sandy loam or decomposed granite. Excess moisture can damage plants, and as a result the best soil for avocado trees should drain well. Leaves and wood chips placed on the top of the soil protect roots against overheating and provide nutrients to the avocado tree. An excess of salt in the soil causes avocado leaves to turn brown. Salt can be cleared from the soil by watering slowly and deeply. For potted plants, irrigate the tree until water runs out the holes on the bottom of the plant for several minutes.
