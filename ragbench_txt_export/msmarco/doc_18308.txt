Overview. Bromine is a member of the halogen family. Halogens are the elements that make up Group 17 (VIIA) of the periodic table. The periodic table is a chart that shows how elements are related to one another. The halogens are also known as the salt formers. Bromine is too reactive to exist as a free element in nature. Instead, it occurs in compounds, the most common of which are sodium bromide (NaBr) and potassium bromide (KBr). These compounds are found in seawater and underground salt beds. These salt beds were formed in regions where oceans once covered the land.
