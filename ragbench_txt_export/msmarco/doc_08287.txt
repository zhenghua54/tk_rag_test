When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay the Bull of Heaven, they further insult Ishtar by throwing the Bull’s hindquarters at her face. Enkidu later dreams that the gods have decided that he must die for these transgressions. After twelve days of suffering, he dies a painful death. In it, the gods are angry with him and Gilgamesh over the death of Humbaba, and they meet to decide what should be done with them. Anu, Ishtar’s father, decrees that someone must be punished... Tablet VII introduces details regarding Enkidu's dream.
