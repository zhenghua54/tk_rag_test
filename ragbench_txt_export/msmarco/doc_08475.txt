There is a method for cooking butternut squash that will retain the most vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrition when you eat them. This way of preparing butternut squash is also quicker and simpler than any other I’ve tried. Personally I think it tastes the best too. Once it is halved, pull out the seeds with your fingers and keep them if you’d like to lightly fry them up while the squash is cooking. While raw hulless pumpkin seeds are a lot easier to eat, you can lightly fry butternut squash seeds with their hulls in a little coconut oil and seasoning for a few minutes.
