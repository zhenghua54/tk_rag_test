Since 1993, the CE Mark (with the CE originally standing for Conformite Europeenne) is a conformity mark (as opposed to a sign of quality of safety) that is used by toy manufacturers to show that their products meet all the relevant consumer safety, health or environmental requirements of the European Directive.
