The mouth of the Amazon River. The Amazon basin is the part of South America drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries. The Amazon drainage basin covers an area of about 6,915,000 km 2 (2,670,000 sq mi), or roughly 40 percent of the South American continent. The Amazon River, which rises in the Andes Mountains at the west of the basin, is usually considered to be the second longest river in the world. However, a team of Brazilian scientists claim that the Amazon is the longest river in the world. It covers about 6,400 km before draining into the Atlantic Ocean.
