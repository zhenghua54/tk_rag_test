Marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism. Before metamorphism, the calcite in the limestone is often in the form of lithified fossil material and biological debris. During metamorphism, this calcite recrystallizes and the texture of the rock changes. In the early stages of the limestone-to-marble transformation the calcite crystals in the rock are very small.
