Depending on the type of stone used, Flagstone or Flagging may be installed in dry or wet applications. Since there is such a large selection of colors, shapes and sizes we do suggest you come in and pick out the Flagging material you like for your application. Tumbled flagstone is also available in certain products. Brookshaw 1-1/2 Minus flagstone is a carmel brown stone with variations of golds, reds, and black, that comes in fairly good size pieces with some heavy natural clefting on the surface.
