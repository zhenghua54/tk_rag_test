Hepatitis C infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate hepatitis C from the body, and infection with hep C usually becomes chronic. Over decades, chronic infection with hepatitis C damages the liver and can cause liver failure. Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that can cause hepatitis. It is unrelated to the other common hepatitis viruses (for example, hepatitis A or hepatitis B).
