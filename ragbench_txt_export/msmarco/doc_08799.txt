Each time height increases by 3, by a standard deviation, the population drops off considerably. There are just about exactly 100,000,000 adult men in America. Now that we know their average height is 5'9 and the standard deviation is 3, we can predict how many of these men fall into various height categories. Out of 100 million adult males, less than 5 million are shorter than 66 inches, or 5. So about 5 million women are taller than 5 million men, while 95% of men are taller than 95% of women. This is the same Gaussian distribution, standard deviation and gender gap as almost all standardized tests.
