1. Lean is Not about Tools. Tools do not solve problem but rather people do. It is not about the tools itâ€™s how they are applied. A large number of organizations have failed to produce the desired results from the direct and prescriptive application of Lean tools. The difference must then be in how the tools were applied, their appropriateness, but not the tools themselves. 2. Lean is Not Devoid of Technology. The fundamental principle of Lean manufacturing is to design a simple manufacturing system, however, that does not mean eliminating technology.
