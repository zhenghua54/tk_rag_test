Making the world better, one answer at a time. The purpose of a titration is to find the equivalence point (stoichiometric point) of a solution. At the equivalence point, the moles of the titrant and analyte are equal to one another. At the midpoint of the solution, the pKa value is equal to the pH value. A titration is the use of carefully measured amounts of a known solution to determine the concentration of another. They often involve acid-base neutralisation or oxidat â€¦ ion-reduction reactions (examples would be sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid, or permanganate with an iron solution).
