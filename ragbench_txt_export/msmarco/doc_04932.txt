At what temperature should you cook a whole chicken in the oven? I cook mine at about 350 in a covered dish for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on size of chicken. You should cook a whole chicken for 20 minutes per pound pound  at 350⁰ F. The internal temperature should read 165 degrees F. Or  40 minutes per kilogram at 180⁰C. . + 7 others found this useful.
