Baked turkey meatballs are a neat and tidy way to make very lean meatballs, too! I use lean turkey breast, and add grated carrots and an egg to bind them and add moisture so they donâ€™t dry out. Bake for 15 minutes while you get everything else ready for dinner, and literally you have dinner in under 30 minutes.
