Here's why the invoice price is only roughly what the dealer paid for the car. It's because of the holdback amount that most manufacturers assign to a car. The holdback is a percentage of the sticker price or invoice price. Manufacturers pay it to the dealer after he sells a car. This means that a dealer could sell a car at invoice price, tell the customer that's he not making one penny on the deal and still get a check from the manufacturer a month later for $500. It's basically the price that the dealer would like you to pay for the car. Invoice Price: This is roughly what the dealer paid the carmaker for the vehicle. The roughly aspect will be discussed later. True Market Value (TMVÂ®) : This is the price at which you can probably buy the car, according to Edmunds.com.
