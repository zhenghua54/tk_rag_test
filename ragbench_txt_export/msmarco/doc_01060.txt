Bring a pot (2 - 3 gallons) of water to a boil. Stir in one pound of non-iodized salt and return to boil. This may seem like an excessive amount of salt, but crayfish are not in the water very long and it's not easy for the salt/seasoning to seep around the shell into the meat.Boil crayfish for 3 or 4 minutes.
