Shea butter, which comes from the African shea tree, has been used for many centuries as a skin moisturizer and hair conditioner. It is also commonly used in Africa for cooking food, making candles, and even coating wood products. Refined shea butter has undergone some form of processing in order to remove its odor and/or change its properties. It is also common for refined shea butter to have additives, such as perfumes or preservatives. Refined shea butter is generally very smooth and has a white color instead of yellow color.
