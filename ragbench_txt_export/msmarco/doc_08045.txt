Weaning an orphan calf that you have raised and nurtured for the past few months can be and emotional strain on both you and the calf. The calf will complain a fair bit during the weaning process but you must be diligent and stubborn. 1  Bottle calves should be weaned by the time they are around 3 to 4 months of age. 1 This will only add to the stress of the calves during weaning time. 2  Beware of the likely reaction of the first-calf heifers. 3  They will crawl the fence if you do not make it escape proof with a couple of strands of hot electric wire or steel panels.
