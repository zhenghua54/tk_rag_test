Location in Brussels The Mannekin Pis is located southwest of the Town Hall. If you are at the Grand Place facing the Town Hall take the exit on the left, the Mannekin Pis is two blocks behind the Town Hall. Alternatively, you can walk from one of the metro stations below. In the 80s another statue was built called Jeanneke Pis to give Manneken Pis a playmate. This other statue is a little girl fountain, but she is lesser known and hides in an alleyway a short distance away from Mannekin Pis.
