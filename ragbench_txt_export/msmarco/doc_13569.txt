Better than a stopwatch... In essence, we measure the time it takes for the pulse of light to travel to the moon and back. This can take anywhere from 2.34 to 2.71 seconds, depending on how far away the moon is at the time (the earth-moon distance ranges from 351,000 km to 406,000 km). To do this, we have a laser that generates intense bursts of light only 100 picoseconds longthat's one tenth of a billionth of a second! Light, which travels 7 earth circumferences every second, only travels about an inch in this time.
