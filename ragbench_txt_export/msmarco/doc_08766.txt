To summarize, the two types of igneous rocks by chemical composition are felsic and mafic. Granite-typically composed of orthoclase, hornblende, biotite, and quartz-is a felsic rock type. Basalt is mostly olivine, augite, and calcium-rich plagioclase, therefore mafic. slide 3 of 6. The Six Types of Igneous Rocks. To recap, granite is a coarse-grained felsic rock, while basalt is a fine-grained mafic rock. All of the other combinations have names too. A coarse-grained mafic rock is called gabbro, and a fine-grained felsic rock is called rhyolite.
