This downrod chart helps us to determine which downrod size you need for your fan based on the height of the ceiling. On an 8 foot ceiling, we recommend the standard pole which is a 3 ½, 4 ½ inch downrod that comes with the fan. This will keep the blades at least 7 feet off the ground. We also recommend the standard downrod on a 9 foot ceiling. However, some manufacturers will include a 6 inch downrod.
