Kataifi pastry is that shredded wheat looking pastry that you will often find beside the phyllo packages in the freezer at the market. It’s mostly used for sweets but recently, I’ve seen it made into nests for savory dishes or jumbo shrimp wrapped in kataifi. 1 Cut off approx. a handful of the frozen kataifi from the package (re-seal and place back in freezer) and pull apart and crumble with your hands. 2  You should have enough to fill 1 cup. 3  Spread the kataifi out on a tray and allow to dry for 30 minutes.
