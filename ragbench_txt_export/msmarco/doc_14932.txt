Canker Sores. There is no cure for canker sores but you may be able to reduce how often you get them by avoiding foods that irritate your mouth. Spicy foods, acidic foods like pickles and sauerkraut, and citrus fruits can cause irritation. If you have canker sores, help ease discomfort by eating bland foods until your sores heal, such as: 1  low-fat milk and other dairy foods. 2  cooked, canned and frozen vegetables. 3  mashed potatoes (fortify by mixing in powdered milk to boost nutrition). 4  cooked or canned fruit, including applesauce
