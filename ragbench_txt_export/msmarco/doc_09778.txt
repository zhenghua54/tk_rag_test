Many people do not realize that mosquitoes are vectors of several human diseases including malaria, encephalitis, yellow fever, dengue, and filariasis. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus from birds to people and horses. Adult mosquitoes are slender, long-legged insects. They have round heads and long, slender wings. When they are resting, the wings lie flat on the insectâ€™s back. Both male and female mosquitoes feed on honeydew, nectar, and plant juices.
