BSC SQ = BSC square, i.e. in both X and Y dimensions. The abbreviation BSC is misused in the case of the package outline, and overall dimensions, as they are specified by physical edges which can be measured. Thus 7.00 BSC is equivalent to 7mm, with the spacing measured between centers (not really the centers of anything in the specific example of one side being 7mm between centers). share | improve this answer.
