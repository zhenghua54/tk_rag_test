The vice president is committed to sharing the burden of the sequester with his staff, an aide to the vice president said. Biden earns a salary of $230,700 a year as vice president, but his net worth is much lower than the president and some Cabinet members who have decided to donate a portion of their salary. Vice President Joe Biden is not planning on donating a portion of his salary, eschewing the lead of President Obama and other Cabinet members who are giving up part of their salary as some federal workers face furloughs because of the sequester.
