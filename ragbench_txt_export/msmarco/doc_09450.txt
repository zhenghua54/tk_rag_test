First to discover New Zealand in 1642, Abel Tasman annexed the country for Holland under the name of 'Staten Landt' (later changed to 'New Zealand' by Dutch mapmakers). Sailing up the country's West Coast, Tasman's first contact with Maori was at the top of the South Island in what is now called Golden Bay. With growing numbers of British migrants, and a dwindling and largely landless Maori population, British culture dominated New Zealand life throughout the 19 th and first half of the 20 th centuries. However, since World War II, New Zealand has moved towards its own unique national identity and place in the world.
