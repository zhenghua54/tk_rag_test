The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (18831969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius stepped down as director of the Bauhaus in 1928, succeeded by the architect Hannes Meyer (18891954). Meyer maintained the emphasis on mass-producible design and eliminated parts of the curriculum he felt were overly formalist in nature.
