That also was a result of the 3 seconds it takes for a radio signal to travel to and from the moon, since radio waves are another form of light waves. Since moonlight is reflected sunlight, it originates at the Sun's surface 93 million miles from the Earth/Moon system. It takes about 8 minutes for that trip, so the short, final hop from the Moon to the Earth is trivial by comparison.
