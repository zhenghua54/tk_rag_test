Gasoline and diesel are actually ancient biofuels. But they are known as fossil fuels because they are made from decomposed plants and animals that have been buried in the ground for millions of years. Biofuels are similar, except that they're made from plants grown today. Much of the gasoline in the United States is blended with a biofuelâ€”ethanol. This is the same stuff as in alcoholic drinks, except that it's made from corn that has been heavily processed.
