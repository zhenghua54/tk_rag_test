Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the HDMI port on your PS3 and the other end of the HDMI cable into your laptop's HDMI port. If your laptop does not have an HDMI port, you will need to identify the video port of your laptop and purchase an adapter or video card that allows you to connect via HDMI. The most popular video ports on laptops are VGA, DVI, HDMI and composite S-Video.
