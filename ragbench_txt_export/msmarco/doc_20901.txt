House demolition can cost between $10,000 and $20,000 or more and creates tons of waste that ends up in landfill sites around the country. You can save thousands in demolition costs and even get paid good money for the house you no longer need. Depending on where your house is located we can either Sell your house for you and remove it, or List your home on our website for Private Sale. All at no charge to you
