Best Answer: Okay, this is a stretch, but gas is definitely a pregnancy sign, so if you have bloating and gas and hiccups then maybe. But I would think that's stretching it. Hiccups in and of themselves are probably not an early pregnancy sign. If you had them with your first pregnancy, then maybe that would be a quirk for you (I know someone who got a yeast infection with both of her pregnancies early on, so this was a sign for her). Hi I was wondering if hiccups are one of the early symptoms of pregnancy...even before the missed period. I know with my first pregnacy this wasn't an issue, but I have a buddy who swears its a sign, and since I NEVER have the hiccups, and now I do...well...it would just be nice to see what everyone else has to...
