Abstract: Uses a case study to illustrate DHL International’s corporate culture, which may be used as a benchmark for other companies in the service industry sector. Suggests that the business success factors of this organization lie in its adoption of the culture and structural characteristics of a clan organization. The notion of clan as applied in business strategy and general management has been very well established. A clan organization, as the term is being used here, is a business‐oriented social enclave consisting of companies and individuals who are bound by strong, non‐contractual bonds.
