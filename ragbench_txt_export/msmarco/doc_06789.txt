leet. A derivitave of the 80's software piracy scene. Originally elite was used to show status on a BBS. Commonly the people who cracked the software, or had sysop access on a board would be referred to as Elite. Due to it being great to be known as leet, newbies started adopting the term and using to describe themselves, often with numerical variations. Anyone who considers themselves leet should be able to tell you who/what Razor1911 is, anyone failing to answer this question should be laughed at.
