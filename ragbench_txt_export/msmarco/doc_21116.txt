The texture of rock shrimp is firm and slightly chewy, the flavor sweet and similar to that of lobster. Rock shrimp range in size from 25 to 110 per pound and most are sold sans shell (both fresh and frozen). They're available frozen year-round and are generally available fresh from July through November, peaking in September.
