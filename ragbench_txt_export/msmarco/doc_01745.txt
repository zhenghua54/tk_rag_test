You should expect blooms about 6-8 weeks after pruning; keep this in mind if you need roses for a rose show or special event. If you prune too early, you risk late winter freezes of the new growth you have encouraged, which will die back. It is important to prune according to the type of rose you have; more on this later. In general, pruning helps keep the rose plant healthy, encourages more (light or moderate pruning) or larger (more severe pruning, as is commonly done with hybrid teas) blooms, and allows you to help shape the bush.
