Each vehicle anchorage system will consist of an upper anchorage point and two lower anchorage points. Each lower anchorage includes a 6 millimeter (mm) (0.24 inches (in.)) diameter straight rod, or bar, that is attached to the vehicle and is lateral and horizontal in direction. The lower anchorage points for the CAUSFIX were positioned 280 mm (11 inches) apart on the test seat structure, with the inboard anchorage approximately 610 mm (24 inches) from the inner surface of the door. An instrumented 9-month-old dummy was used in all the tests.
