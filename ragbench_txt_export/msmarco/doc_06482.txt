Figure 9.9 Tropical steppe of Ethiopia. (Sources (FAO). The tropical steppe climate is a transitional climate between the tropical wet and tropical dry climates. The controlling factors of the climate are similar to that of the tropical dry climate, though temperatures are cooler and annual precipitation is higher. The tropical steppe is not as dry as the tropical desert climate as it lies closer to a source of moisture. If on the equatorward side of the desert it is the ITCZ, or the subpolar low and midlatitude cyclones if it is located poleward side.
