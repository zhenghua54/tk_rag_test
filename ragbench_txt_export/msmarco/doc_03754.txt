The typical respiratory rate for a healthy adult at rest is 12–20 breaths per minute. Average resting respiratory rates by age are: 1  birth to 6 weeks: 30–60 breaths per minute. 2  6 months: 25–40 breaths per minute. Measurement [edit]. Human respiration rate is measured when a person is at rest and involves counting the number of breaths for one minute by counting how many times the chest rises. An optical breath rate sensor can be used for monitoring patients during a magnetic resonance imaging scan
