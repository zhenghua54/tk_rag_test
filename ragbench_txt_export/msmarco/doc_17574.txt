In India, chartered accountants are regulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India which was established by the Chartered Accountants Act 1949. Prior to 1949, Restricted State Auditors were registered with the respective princely states and British provincial state governments. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda works with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and is the sole organisation in Bermuda with the right to award the chartered accountant designation.
