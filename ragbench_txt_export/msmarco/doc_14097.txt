First, meat is largely devoid of salt, so when immersed in a salty water solution the process of osmosis kicks into action and the area with less salt concentration (the meat) pulls the saltwater solution into the meat and hydrates it. This helps to keep the meat juicier over the several hour smoking process. Second, the introduction of salt into the meat causes a break down of certain proteins within the meat. This breakdown makes the extremely lean venison much more tender than it would be without this process. Here is a basic brine recipe to try to make one-gallon of brine.
