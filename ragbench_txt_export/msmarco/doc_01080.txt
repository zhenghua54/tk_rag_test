the oxygen exchange in the lungs takes place across the membranes of small balloon like structures called alveoli attached to the branches of the bronchial passages these alveoli inflate and deflate with inhalation and exhalation the behavior of the alveoli is largely dictated by laplace s law and surface tension it takes some effort to breathe in because these tiny balloons must be inflated but the elastic recoil of the tiny balloons assists us in the process of exhalation inflating the alveoli in the process of respiration requires an excess pressure inside the alveoli relative to their surroundings this is actually accomplished by making the pressure in the thoracic cavity negative with respect to atmospheric pressure
