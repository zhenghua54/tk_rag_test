Turtle Animal Totem Symbolism. There is a story that appears, in many cultures, of the world being carried on the back of four great elephants, who in turn stand upon the back of a giant sea-turtle. The Iroquois believe that we live on the back of a great turtle that cast off itâ€™s shell. The turtle animal totem helps you move slowly throughout this world, observing it as it goes by, allowing slow steady work to drive your purposes forward. Even the act of putting her eggs in the sand speaks of this wisdom.
