Coconut Oil As A Hoof Conditioner......Our Conclusion. We liked coconut oil as a hoof conditioner. In our extreme drought conditions it reduced the brittleness of our horse's hooves without over-softening them. It is also an ingredient in some commercially available hoof dressings, such as Hoofmaker (which is a brand we didn't try, by the way). Below: Partially melted coconut oil in a clear container. Recipe #2: A mixture of two parts coconut oil, one part glycerin, and one part aloe vera gel.
