1 Ventless (also called vent-free or unvented) gas fireplaces don't need a chimney or vent, and are either zero clearance (right against a wall) or close clearance (a few inches away). 2  They cost about $400-$1,500 plus installation of the gas lines and any desired mantle or surround. 1 Options include fans to move the heat, remote controls, wall switches and wall-mounted thermostats. 2  Inserts cost $1,200-$2,900, with professional installation adding another $600-$1,000. 3  A direct-vent gas fireplace doesn't need a chimney and is a way to add a fireplace where there isn't one.
