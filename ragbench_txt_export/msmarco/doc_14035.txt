Algae control in ponds is a very important part of maintaining a healthy pond. In very high densities, algae blooms may discolor the water and out-compete, poison, or asphyxiate other life forms. Some algae are toxic to humans and dogs. Excessive algae growth can indicate problems with water quality.
