The dry air around a heater can split flooring boards. It doesn't happen often, but moisture changes or excessive dryness in the environment of a wood floor can cause one of the boards to split. It's usually possible to fix a split by spreading glue inside it and closing it with a clamp. In a floor, however, the edges of the board aren't exposed, so there's no place for the clamp. That leaves you two options. The easier one is to fill the split, and the other, which requires some carpentry skills, is to cut the board out of the floor and replace it.
