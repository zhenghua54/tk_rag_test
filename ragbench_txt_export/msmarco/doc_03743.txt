Pulse Oximeters are devices that are typically slipped onto the finger to read a persons heart rate and measure oxygen blood levels. They may also be slipped onto the toes, nose or earlobes. A pulse oximeter works by shining an infrared light through your body tissue onto a photo sensor. A Pulse Oximeter will also display a heart rate reading. Healthy heart rate readings depend on your age. For elderly persons over the age of 70, a heart rate in the region of 90 beats per minute is considered a normal level. A healthy pulse rate for adults aged 18-70 falls anywhere between 60 and 80 beats per minute.
