12/13/2004: Clarification under Policy to add a single as follows: Sacroiliac joint arthrography with a single injection for diagnostic purposes (and potential pain relief) with or without the anticipation of lumbar fusion is considered medically necessary. Up to TWO injections per calendar year are allowed. If a provider injects medication without radiographic control, it is not certain if in reality the injection is made into the joint or around it. In such a case, the service is considered to be a trigger point injection.
