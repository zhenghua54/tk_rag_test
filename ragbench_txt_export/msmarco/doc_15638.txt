That will translate into an additional 4 lbs. weight loss for one month, bringing your total to around 10 lbs. Although you potentially can lose up to 10 lbs. by eating fruits, vegetables and lean proteins for one month, you should view your planned diet changes as more of a lifestyle change than a one-time effort. Still, you'll need to count calories and consume fewer of them. To lose 4 to 5 lbs. in one month, you should consume about 500 to 600 fewer calories each day than you would if you weren't trying to lose weight.
