The answer is because the female hummingbird will not start incubating the eggs until both of them have been laid. The incubation period for hummingbird last usually between 16-18 days, but it can last as long as three weeks if the weather at the time is cooler then usual. The female hummingbird tries to maintain the temperature of the nest at about 96 degrees. So in general, the gestation period of hummingbird eggs is between two and three weeks, depending on the circumstances which are happening at the time. A hummingbird eggs will be white in color and only about the size of a pea or jelly bean.
