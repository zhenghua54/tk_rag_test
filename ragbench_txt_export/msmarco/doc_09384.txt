Progesterone's role in weight gain is more deceiving; low levels of the hormone do not actually cause you to gain weight, but instead cause water retention or bloating. Hormones and weight gain go hand in hand. So, menopause weight gain is actually hormone weight gain. Estrogen: It is common for estrogen levels to diminish during menopause causing cessation of ovulation. The decreased production of estrogen by the ovaries causes a woman's body to search for other sources of estrogen.
