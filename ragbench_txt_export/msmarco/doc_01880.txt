The mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He) are two equivalent parameters that capture the amount of hemoglobin available to the reticulocytes within the previous 3-4 days. Both parameters directly correlate with the functional availability of iron in the bone marrow. The automated hematology analyzer can also report a measurement of reticulocyte-specific hemoglobin content as mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (Ret-He), depending on the type of instrument used.
