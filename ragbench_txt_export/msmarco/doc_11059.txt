Moxifloxacin comes as an ophthalmic solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually used three times a day for 7 days. Try to use at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.
