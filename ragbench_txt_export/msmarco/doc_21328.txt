Foetus responds. Absolutely, everyone knows that the foetus present inside the womb of the mother can hear. But something which you did not know is that foetus responds to sound properly i.e. in a similar manner as they respond to any kind of internal stimulation. New born don’t have the reflex to blink. Correctly said, new born babies don’t have very good reflex actions. An example of the same is that they don’t blink their eyes very often as adults do, this may be the reason you will always lose in the eye blink game.
