The Professional NBA and (WNBA) Court is 94 feet long and 50 feet wide. Note: WNBA Basketball Court Dimensions are the same in every respect as the NBA. The Foul Line: For all courts including the NBA, the “foul line” distance is 15 feet from the foul line to the front of the backboard. “The key” (sometimes called “the lane”) for an NBA/Professional court is 16 feet wide. Regulation courts have the backboard extending out 4 feet over the baseline into the key. A 6 foot arc (half circle) extends from the foul line away from the basket to complete the key.
