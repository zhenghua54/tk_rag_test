Leupold has created a number of mounting systems, each matched to different needs and preferences. Most of the following rings and bases are available in gloss, matte or silver to compliment your scope or receiver. Different ring heights accommodate various objective sizes and barrel shapes. The Leupold steel standard bases and rings are the most versatile of any mounting system we offer. The rear ring is secured by windage adjustment screws, allowing the scopeâ€™s internal adjustments to be reserved for precise sight-in.
