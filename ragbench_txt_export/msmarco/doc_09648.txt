The diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson's disease is the same as idiopathic, or typical, Parkinson's disease except for the age of the patient. The average age of diagnosis is around 62. A recent study found that 65% of people with Parkinson's onset under 20 years old and 32% of people with uonset between 20 and 30 had a genetic mutation that scientists believe increases the risk of Parkinson's. To the best of our knowledge, there are no genes that guarantee that you will develop Parkinson's.
