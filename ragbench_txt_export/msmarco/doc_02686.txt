Bemberg, Cupro Linings jacquard, and yarn dyed. Our linings are made of Bemberg CuproÂ® , which is a natural fibre (the raw material it is made of is cotton) and which is very used in the field of tailoring and clothing in general, thanks to its silken, transpiring and thermoregulatoring qualities. The Bemberg Cupro's Jacquard is a very precious material, thanks to its changing quality and its unique brightness, and it doesn't have a back side. Both sides can be used, offering therefore two different changing shades.
