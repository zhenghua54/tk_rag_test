Native American Totems & Their Meanings. A totem is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol of a tribe, clan, family or individual. Native American tradition provides that each individual is connected with nine different animals that will accompany each person through life, acting as guides. Are you drawn to figurines or paintings of a specific animal? The totem itself is a symbol that represents this animal. This could be any number of items-a crest, a totem pole, an emblem, a small figurine or anything else that depicts your animal guide.
