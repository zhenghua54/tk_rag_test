Cashton is the largest Wisconsin Amish community. Founded in 1966, the settlement had grown to 13 churches as of 2009 (see Amish Settlements Across America: 2008, David Luthy, for dates of founding and some church district numbers). Wisconsin is a state which saw Amish arrive relatively late compared to other states associated with the Plain People. Though the first Amish only began to settle in Wisconsin in the early 1900s, the Wisconsin Amish presence has grown to become the fourth-largest in North America.
