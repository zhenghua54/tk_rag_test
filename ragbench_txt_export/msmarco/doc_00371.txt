The Titmouse is only distantly related to the Tits and/or Chickadees but is not in the same genus, although it once was. According to The Dictionary of American Bird Names by E. Choate, Titmouse is derived from the Anglo-Saxon masse meaning small bird as does the word tit which means little or small. I'd agree with Keith as Titmice just doesn't ring right somehow and puts the emphasis more on Mice than the intended flock of Birds. Though with Canada Geese it's a different thing, to my mind, Geese is what I always use and what sounds right, Canada Goose for plural just doesn't sound right.
