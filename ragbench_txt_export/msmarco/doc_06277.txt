After completing this exercise, you should be able to: Design PCR primers to amplify given target regions from a DNA template. Identify the direction in which a given primer would be extended by polymerase on a given template. Design a pair of primers to amplify the entire length of the following 45 base pair sequence. Make each primer 14 bases long. Write the sequences of the primers in 5' to 3' order.
