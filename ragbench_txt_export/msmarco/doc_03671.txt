Functions of the BBB. The BBB has several important functions: 1  Protects the brain from foreign substances in the blood that may injure the brain. 2  Protects the brain from hormones and neurotransmitters in the rest of the body. 1 Large molecules do not pass through the BBB easily. 2  Low lipid (fat) soluble molecules do not penetrate into the brain. 3  However, lipid soluble molecules, such as barbituate drugs, rapidly cross through into the brain. 4  Molecules that have a high electrical charge are slowed.
