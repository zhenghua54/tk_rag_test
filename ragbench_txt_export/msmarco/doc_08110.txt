Instead, these dollars could be better spent by investing them in other categories of inventory. When Neighborhood Pet Supply has annual sales of Chews dog food of $18,600, and a gross profit margin of 53%, the store needs to have enough Chews food so that there is always product on the shelf. However, there does not need to be so much Chews food that the store does not have to reorder more for the next 12 months. However, if Neighborhood Pet Supply had inventory of only $1,457 at cost, and the same annual sales of $18,600, there would be a 6 time turn. There would also be $7,285 available to invest in other profitable merchandise for the store.
