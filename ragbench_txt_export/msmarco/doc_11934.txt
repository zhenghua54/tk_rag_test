Easy-Start to Finish-Loom knitting a hat without patterns or counting. Join Us at http://www.Loomahat.com. You will learn how to start knitting with a loom, how to make a brim and how to close the hat. I prefer to use the Knifty Knitter Loom but these instructions work regardless of the loom as long as it is circular. Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/LoomaHat.

Once you have learned how to make the basic loom knit hat you can use this information to make other loom knitting craft projects like a purse, a baby cacoon, a ball, a shoe sack and many other neat things.
