If you remove the skin, you're left with a chicken thigh that has about 130 calories and only 7 grams of fat. Boneless, skinless chicken can generally be bought at most grocery stores. There are several ways to prepare boneless, skinless chicken breasts, such as frying, grilling, or baking. Get out a large enough baking pan to fit all of the chicken thighs you plan to cook. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter to the pan. Spread it out evenly, so that your chicken will not stick to the pan. This will get your chicken brown and crispy.
