The WMI Query Language (WQL) is a subset of standard American National Standards Institute Structured Query Language (ANSI SQL) with minor semantic changes to support WMI. For a complete list of supported WQL keywords, see WQL (SQL for WMI) . Using SQL keywords for object or property names may restrict a query from being parsed. The following SQL keywords are restricted: NULL, TRUE, and FALSE. Note There are limits to the number of AND and OR keywords that can be used in WQL queries. Large numbers of WQL keywords used in a complex query can cause WMI to return the WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION error code as an HRESULT value. The limit of WQL keywords depends on how complex the query is
