The prices for dental crowns range from $500 to $2,500 per crown and are dependent upon the materials used, location of tooth and geographic location. The average cost of a crown is $825, with or without dental insurance coverage. The cheapest cost of a dental crown is $500 for a simple metal crown. They are less expensive than all-porcelain crowns, but more than the porcelain-over-metal crowns. The average cost of a gold crown is $900, but the prices vary if the patient has insurance.
