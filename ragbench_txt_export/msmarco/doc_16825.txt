Formerly the name carbohydrate was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula C m (H 2 O) n. Following this definition, some chemists considered formaldehyde (CH 2 O) to be the simplest carbohydrate, while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde. While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix-ose. For example, grape sugar is the monosaccharide glucose, cane sugar is the disaccharide sucrose and milk sugar is the disaccharide lactose (see illustration).
