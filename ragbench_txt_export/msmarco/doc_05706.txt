1 Consider Web Site Testing “[You] visit a specific Web site and perform an exact function…While you’re doing that, your screen is being recorded to track your mouse movement and clicks, your voice (but not your face) is recorded to hear as you verbalize your steps…You’re paid $10 for about 10 to 20 minutes of work.”. You must have a PayPal account and live in a country that can receive PayPal money transfers. You will receive your payment exactly 7 days after completing a website or app test (This waiting period allows us to ensure the quality of all recordings).
