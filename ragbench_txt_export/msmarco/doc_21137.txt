If you have a little ding, you may be able to fix the problem with a hair dryer and dry ice or a can of condensed air. (You don't want to try this on a dent with any paint damage.). Heat the dented area with a hair dryer, making sure to hold it five to seven inches away from the panel. Keep the hair dryer moving, and continue for one to three minutes. The area should be warm to touch. While it is still warm, apply the cold component.
