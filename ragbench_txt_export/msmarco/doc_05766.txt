The easiest way to distinguish between an accountant and a controller is to understand what each does in the accounting department. Basically speaking, an accountant is in charge of preparing financial reports and analyzing how the company is performing financially. Controllers are in charge of money and accountants, and accountants are responsible for keeping tabs on where the money is going. As the Chief Accounting Officer of an organization, the controller, often called a comptroller, is also responsible for complying with tax laws and government reporting requirements.
