It has been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used, there has been the practice of recording the employee's starting and stopping time to the nearest five minutes, or to the nearest one-tenth or quarter of an hour. Time missed or worked within that interval will not be deducted from or added to the time worked, whereas time missed or worked outside that interval will result in that interval being deducted from or added to the time worked. The regulations on this are found in subpart D of part 785 of the wage and hour regulations.
