Frog eggs have a gestation period of around one week, until hatching into tadpoles. However this varies with the particular species of frog. Actually, a tadpole is what â€¦ hatches from a frog's eggs. In this part of the frog's life cycle, they grow legs and frog features which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the type of frog.
