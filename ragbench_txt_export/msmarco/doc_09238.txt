The results show that people between the ages of 18-50 after the second dose develop antibodies after 2 weeks and most after 1 month. And almost all the people develop the antibodies in one month of the final dosage to protect against the infection for as long as the hepatitis vaccine last. Hepatitis B virus causes the infection of liver and spreads out in the entire body later through the saliva, blood, semen or vaginal fluids. Some of the people infected with this virus become chronic carriers. Out of the chronic carriers 15% to 20% people die of either cirrhosis or liver cancer.
