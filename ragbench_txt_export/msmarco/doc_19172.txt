Sativa. These are marijuana plants that are described as lanky and wide. The shape of a sativa plant is similar to that of a Christmas tree. Compared to indica, the sativa plant varieties usually have higher THC but lower CBD properties. As a result they provide a cerebral effect producing an energetic buzz, which makes you sociable, happy and trippy. Ruderalis. The ruderalis are cannabis plants that are stocky and short. This type of marijuana plant usually grows in Central Asia and in Europe. The ruderalis varieties do not depend on the light cycles during their flowering period. This is why the strains that are autoflowering contain ruderalis genes
