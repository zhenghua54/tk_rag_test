Regardless of the field, most principal scientists perform many similar functions. These include coordinating the actions of the scientific team, training new team members, carrying out performance reviews of team members, and acting as a general expert and source of knowledge in their lab. Principal scientists must also have detailed knowledge of relevant technology and equipment. For instance, principal scientists working in manufacturing often must be able to test materials with centrifuges, radiological equipment, lasers, and related equipment.
