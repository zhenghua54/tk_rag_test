Family physicians and general practitioners are generally not trained or well-equipped to make this type of psychological diagnosis. Many people with borderline personality disorder don’t seek out treatment. People with personality disorders, in general, do not often seek out treatment until the disorder starts to significantly interfere or otherwise impact a person’s life.
