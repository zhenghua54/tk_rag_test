The temperature profile is in part mandated by the (mechanical) design of the oven, and batch ovens have a radically different design than conveyor belt ovens. In particular, these guidelines apply to the “eC-reflow-mate” reflow oven from Eurocircuits. A particular difference is the influence of thermal inertia. In some reflow ovens, the PCBs are snapped in a frame that touches the PCB only on the edges. The purpose of the frame is to minimize the contact area between the PCB and the oven, to avoid heat from the PCB to flow away. Other reflow ovens have a grid plate onto which you place the PCBs.
