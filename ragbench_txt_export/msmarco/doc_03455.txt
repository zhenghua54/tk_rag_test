Like adults, children can be affected by swelling in their eyelids. Common causes include trauma and allergies, but children can also develop a swollen eyelid from eye conditions such as blepharitis and pink eye (conjunctivitis). Children also experience symptoms like redness, burning sensations, watery eyes, and pain.
