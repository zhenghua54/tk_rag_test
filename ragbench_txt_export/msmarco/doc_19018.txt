Previously, in February 2011, the Bank’s Court of Directors created an interim FPC to undertake, as far as possible, the future statutory role of FPC. The interim FPC held its first policy meeting in June 2011, and met on a quarterly basis thereafter. The Committee publishes a record of its formal policy meetings, and is responsible for the Bank’s bi-annual Financial Stability Report. The FPC is a statutory sub-committee of Court. The Committee is charged with a primary objective of identifying, monitoring and taking action to remove or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system.
