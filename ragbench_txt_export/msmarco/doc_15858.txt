Basketball Court Dimensions. Basketball court dimensions are more than a matter of painted lines and mathematics. There is a symmetry to the court, an elegance of lines and boundaries that determine not only the physical structure of a game, but the rules and philosophies behind one of Americaâ€™s most popular games. Basketball court dimensions have symmetry and simplicity. The court is divided in half, with boundary lines marking the sidelines and the end lines. The mid-court line features a center circle where the opening tip takes place at the beginning of the game.
