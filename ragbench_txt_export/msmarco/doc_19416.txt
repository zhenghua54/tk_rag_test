Once the mining is finished, the dirt and rock are returned to the pit, the topsoil is replaced, and the area is replanted. Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is used when the coal is buried several hundred feet below the surface. Some underground mines are 1,000 feet deep. To remove coal in these underground mines, miners ride elevators down deep mine shafts where they run machines that dig out the coal.
