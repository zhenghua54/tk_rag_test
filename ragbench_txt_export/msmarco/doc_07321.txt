Salts. Occurring naturally in soils, salts can be a problem for avocado trees if they are in high concentrations. You will notice a salt issue if you observe the tree's leaves; the tips may appear sunburned or brown. Good Drainage. Tree roots suffocated with constant moisture will exhibit their poor health with low fruit yields and possible branch die-back; avocado trees must have good soil drainage for healthy growth. Although you may be concerned about keeping your tree watered, slightly dry conditions are best for the avocado.
