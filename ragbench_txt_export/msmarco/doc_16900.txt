See Engineering drawing. In making a pictorial drawing, the viewing direction that shows the object and its details to the best advantage is chosen. The resultant drawing is orthographic if the viewing rays are considered as parallel, or perspective if the rays are considered as meeting at the eye of the observer. 1). Oblique pictorial drawings, while not true orthographic views, offer a convenient method for drawing circles and other curves in their true shape (Fig. 2). In order to reduce the distortion in an oblique drawing, measurements along the receding axis may be foreshortened.
