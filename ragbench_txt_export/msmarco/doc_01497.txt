Please call the Habitat office for updates @ 412-351-0512. EXAMPLE: If there are four persons in your household with a combined income of $32,550 per year, you may qualify. You must have a satisfactory credit history, but your credit does NOT need to be perfect. Partner Families purchase their homes from Habitat and make a regular monthly mortgage payment. This payment is usually between $450 and $550 per month (including taxes and insurance), depending on the size and location of the house.
