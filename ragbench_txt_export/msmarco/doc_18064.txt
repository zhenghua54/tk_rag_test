Between four and 10 years. Yep. You read that right. And the thing is, I believe it. It can take a long time to write a novel, if you're doing research or you get stuck, or if you're fine-tuning sentences or having trouble with point of view. On the other hand, other writers, like author Jane Green, whose newest novel, Tempting Fate, is a NYT best-seller, writes her books in six months.
