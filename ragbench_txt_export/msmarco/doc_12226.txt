As a general rule, you can withdraw your contributions from a Roth IRA at any time without paying tax or penalty. If you withdraw money from a conversion too soon after that event, and before age 59Â½, you may incur a penalty. You convert this IRA to a Roth IRA, paying tax on $6,000. Two years later you make a regular contribution of $2,000 to a different Roth IRA. A year after that, you withdraw $3,000 from the conversion Roth IRA.
