Or you can give him/her the good food then if the dog wont eat it show him/her a piece of steak or something that she loves and drop it in the bowl that's is what i do with my dogs. Another thing to do is to not leave food lying around for them all of the time. By dog food I take it what is meant is canned dog food. This is composed of meat and offal together with, in some products, a cereal or other non-meat filler. The product is cooked and sterilised/pasteurised during the canning process. It should therefore be microbiologically safe to eat for humans.
