The herbicide tolerant variety is designed to survive high doses of toxic weed killers. Such toxic weed killers are themselves linked to a string of health disorders like birth defects, cancer, and hormone disruption. When used on highly resistant crops, some of these toxins end up in our food. Other GM foods are designed to produce their own insecticide in each and every cell. An example of this is BT-toxin. BT-toxin is an insecticide that breaks open the stomachs of insects in order to kill them. Non-GMO and organic food are essential to the Body Ecology Diet. Choosing food that is non-GMO falls right in line with the Body Ecology principles of healing.
