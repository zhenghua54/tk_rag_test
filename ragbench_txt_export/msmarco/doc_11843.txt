India Visa Fees. The India visa fee amount depends on the type of visa applied for and duration of visa. Since consular fees are fixed on the basis of reciprocal arrangements or special agreements between governments, the fees differ for citizens of different countries. In addition to the visa fees, a processing service fee of $17.00 will be charged by Cox & Kings Global Services per application, per passport. Applicants needing a Protected Area Permit (PAP) will need to pay an extra $30 in addition to the consular fee.
