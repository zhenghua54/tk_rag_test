[Native Advertisement]. Falling oil prices are affecting the drilling rig market in multiple ways. The cost of drilling rigs is expected to fall approximately 40 percent over the next year, Managing Director of Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. Robert Hosking told Bloomberg. A rig that cost upwards of $400,000 per day to rent may only cost $250,000 per day later this year. Why the fall? The decline in oil rig rental prices is a result of the oil and gas exploration market adjusting to lower oil prices and reduced spending on exploration and production projects.
