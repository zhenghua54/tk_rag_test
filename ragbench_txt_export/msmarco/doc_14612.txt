During transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase synthesizes a strand of messenger RNA (mRNA) using one strand of the gene as a template. mRNA is synthesized using nucleotides that contain the bases A, C, G, and U (instead of T), which pair with the complementary bases of the DNA template strand. In viruses that use RNA as their genetic material RNA that can be directly translated by ribosomes is referred to as + strand or sense strand. A nucleic acid strand that is complementary to a + strand is-strand, or antisense.
