Methane, CH4, is a chemical compound composed of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. It is one of the most common gases in the universe, as well as on Earth. While it is valued for its energy-production capabilities, methane also has the ability to potentially wreak havoc on the Earth's fragile ecosystems. This gas is a type of alkane, which are compounds composed only of carbon and hydrogen atoms in various numbers. In fact, methane is the simplest form of alkane. Despite the smells that some may be tempted to associate with the gas, it is odorless and colorless.
