Fig. 17. The lungs become covered by the visceral layer of the pleural cavity, the pleura visceralis. Towards the outside, the pleural cavity is bounded by the parietal layer, the pleura parietalis. Through their rapid increase in size the two lungs, left and right, enclose the heart that is in their middle.
