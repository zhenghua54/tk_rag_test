But with gene patents, the publication of the information means that no one else can create products with patented genes for the 20 years that the patent is in effect without paying royalties to the patent holder. That makes some genetic research prohibitively expensive, or even impossible. I think companies shouldn’t be able to patent human genes. First of all its your genes, your cells you own that. Companies shouldn’t just take something from you without your consent of it.
