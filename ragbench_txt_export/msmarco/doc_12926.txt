A short history of NATO. It is often said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union. From the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in April 1949 through the Cold War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the terrorist attacks of the early 2000s and recent operations and partnerships to emerging security challenges, NATO is a part of history.
