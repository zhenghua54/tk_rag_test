The next time that you will prune your roses will be in late November when most of the foliage has fallen to the ground. This is what my established Knock Out roses looked like BEFORE I pruned them. You can see the purple ribbon that I have tied to a stake so you can determine just how much I have pruned. Remove at least 12â€³ of new growth with pruners or shears. The answer is clearly no. The reason that I suggest to prune your roses now is to remove the first heavy flush of growth after your Knock Out roses have passed their first full display of color.
