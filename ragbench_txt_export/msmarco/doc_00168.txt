This is probably the WQL query most often found in various WMI articles and textbooks. It simply gets all the instances of a WMI class named Win32_Process which represents Windows processes. If you are interested in the properties of Win32_Process, see here. This is where the LIKE WQL operator comes in handy. Just like in SQL, the ‘%’ meta character replaces any string of zero or more characters, so this query returns all Win32_Service instances where the Name property contains the string SQL. Query text: WMI namespace: Root\Cimv2.
