A permanent magnet generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. In this device the rotor windings have been replaced with permanent magnets. These devices do not require a separate DC supply for the excitation circuit or do they have slip rings and contact brushes. The demand for these devices is increasing day by day. With the increasing cost of electricity people are looking for an alternate source of energy and the permanent magnet generator perfectly fits in that place. These devices do not use any environmental resources to produce energy and thus are environment friendly.
