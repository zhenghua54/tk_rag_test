Roast the turkey: The rule of thumb for cooking a turkey is 13 minutes per pound. So our 16-pound turkey was estimated to cook in about 3 1/2 hours. However, some factors like brining the bird, cooking with an empty (un-stuffed) cavity, and leaving the legs un-trussed will contribute to much faster cooking. Add liquid to the roasting pan: When ready to roast, pour two cups of broth or water into the roasting pan. Place the turkey in the oven and turn down the heat: Place the turkey in the oven and turn down the heat to 350Â°F. We recommend roasting turkeys breast-side up.
