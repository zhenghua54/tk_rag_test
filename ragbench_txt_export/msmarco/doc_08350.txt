Ovulation is also arrested in some women during the first 5-6 months of active breastfeeding, leading to a larger stock of follicles at around the age of 45 years. So, pregnancy and breastfeeding are likely to delay the onset of the age of menopause. For example, let us assume that a daughter and her mother started menstruating when both of them were 12 years old. Taking birth control pills which prevent ovulation will also delay menopause. Birth control pills contain hormones that can block the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation. This will again prevent decrease in the number of oocytes in the ovaries.
