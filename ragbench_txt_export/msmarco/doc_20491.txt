For nearly all practical purpose, bismuth can be regarded as not radioactive. There is only one isotope of bismuth ordinarily found in nature, 209Bi, and though it is radioactive, it is only barely so, having a half life of 19,000,000,000,000,000,000 years, a fact only recently discovered. Like all elements, there are synthetic radioactive isotopes of bismuth. Bismuth is a chemical element that has the symbol Bi and atomic number 83. This heavy, brittle, white crystalline trivalent poor metal has a pink tinge and chemically re â€¦ sembles arsenic and antimony.
