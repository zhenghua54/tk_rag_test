Factors that influence the rate of a chemical reaction include temperature, state of matter of reactants, concentration, presence of catalysts, and pressure. PM Images, Getty Images. Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. For solids, the shape and size of the reactants makes a big difference in the reaction rate. Presence of Catalysts and Competitors. Catalysts (e.g., enzymes) lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction and increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process.
