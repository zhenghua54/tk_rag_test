A handful of native animals can eat Cane Toads and survive. Amongst these are the Snapping Turtle, Wollumbinia latisternum; the Freshwater Snake, Tropidonophis mairii; the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus; the Water Rat, Hydromys chrysogaster; and some birds such as ibises and the Torresian Crow, Corrus orru.
