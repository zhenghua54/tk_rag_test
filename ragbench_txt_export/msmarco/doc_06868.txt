Overview. The mild taste of the Walla Walla onion can add a sweet flavor to any dish or meal where it can be used raw for the best taste. You'll want to plant Walla Walla onion sets as soon after you purchase them as possible so they don't start to go bad before they get in the ground. After planting you should start to see new growth within a few weeks and have onions ready for harvest in 115 days
