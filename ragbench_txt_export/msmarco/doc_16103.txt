Acid dyes are not substantive to cellulosic fibers. Most synthetic food colors fall in this category. Basic dyes are water-soluble cationic dyes that are mainly applied to acrylic fibers, but find some use for wool and silk. Usually acetic acid is added to the dyebath to help the uptake of the dye onto the fiber. Basic dyes are also used in the coloration of paper. Direct or substantive dyeing is normally carried out in a neutral or slightly alkaline dyebath, at or near boiling point, with the addition of either sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) or sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3). Direct dyes are used on cotton, paper, leather, wool, silk and nylon.
