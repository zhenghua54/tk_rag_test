The life expectancy for mobile, mild cerebral palsy children even approaches that of normal children. With effective therapies, early intervention, techniques, and improved care, cerebral palsy life expectancy for children across the cerebral palsy spectrum is increasing. As parents of a severely disabled cerebral palsy child, we were worried about our son's life expectancy. Our doctors were not optimistic. As you might expect, the life expectancy of cerebral palsy children correlates to the severity of their brain injury and disabilities. Children with more severe brain injury and therefore less mobility and function, typically live shorter lives.
