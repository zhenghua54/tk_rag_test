The price specified in a forward contract for a specific commodity. The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, unlike a futures contract, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and there is not daily marking-to-market to minimize default risk. If there is no allowance for these credit risks, then the forward price will equal the futures price.
