3. Ask for a refund if you have weeks or months left on the policy. This is especially likely if you are canceling your auto insurance for an unexpected reason, such as a death in the family. If there is time left on the policy and you already paid for the entire year, you may be entitled to a refund. Car insurance is the easiest way to fulfill this requirement. If you cancel a policy without first putting a new car insurance policy in place, you can face: 1  Fines or penalties for driving uninsured. 2  Liability for all of the personal injury and property damages incurred in an accident you cause.
