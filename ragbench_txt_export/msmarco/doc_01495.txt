Habitat does not use credit scores as a basis for creditworthiness. We look at good debt and bad debt levels. Good debt is an account that is being paid on time; bad debt is an account that has gone to collections. In order to apply, your good debt must be low, and your. bad debt must be less than $500. If selected, you will be required to work one full 8-hour day per week until the house is completed, which normally takes about 12 months. This is what we call “sweat equity.” A single applicant will need to put in a minimum of 250 hours of sweat equity, while two applicants will work a minimum of 300 hours.
