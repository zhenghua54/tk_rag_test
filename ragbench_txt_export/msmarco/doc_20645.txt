Mood swings occur most frequently during two stages of your childâ€™s life. The first stage is the time when toddlers test out their boundaries and are beginning to develop a sense of independence. The next time is most likely to be just before puberty when hormonal changes are often associated with mood changes. Mood swings can first occur as early as 5 or 6 years of age, but they are rare in this age group. However, by adolescence, the likelihood of the more severe form of mood swings is much greater and similar to that of adults; as many as 1.6% of all adolescents may have severe mood swings.
