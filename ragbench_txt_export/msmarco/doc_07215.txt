In the southern hemisphere, air moving from high to low pressure is deflected to the left by the Coriolis force. The amount of deflection the air makes is directly related to both the speed at which the air is moving and its latitude. Coriolis Force an artifact of the earth's rotation. Once air has been set in motion by the pressure gradient force, it undergoes an apparent deflection from its path, as seen by an observer on the earth. This apparent deflection is called the Coriolis force and is a result of the earth's rotation. As air moves from high to low pressure in the northern hemisphere, it is deflected to the right by the Coriolis forc
