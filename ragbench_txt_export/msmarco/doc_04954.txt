Recently, Dr. Oz called Garcinia Cambogia (HCA) the “Holy Grail of Weight Loss”- you’d better believe that it is worth taking a look at! Dr. Chen called Garcinia Cambogia Extract a “Dual Action Fat Buster” that suppresses appetite and prevents fat from being made. First, make sure that the supplement is clearly marked as HCA, or Garcinia Cambogia and that it contains at least fifty percent hydroxycitric acid. Next, make sure that the product mentions that it has potassium and calcium in the supplement, which can really help maintain your metabolism level.
