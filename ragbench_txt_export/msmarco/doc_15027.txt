Determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity. The capacity of furnaces and air conditioners is given in BTUs per hour. You need to establish the correct number of BTUs per square foot for your house needed to either heat or cool it. In warmer climates, you may need only 30 to 35 BTU per hour per square foot to heat your house adequately. In colder climates, you may need up to 50 to 60 BTU/h/ft 2. In general, the further from the equator you live, the greater the number of BTU/h/ft 2 you need, but weather patterns and geography modify this somewhat.
