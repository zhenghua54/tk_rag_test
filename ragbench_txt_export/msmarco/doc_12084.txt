Capillary Electrophoresis System. 1  The DNA fragments are separated by size. 2  The agarose gel is used for separation of large DNA molecule and the polyacrylamide gel is used for the small DNA fragments. 3  The gel is dipped in the buffer solution. The capillary electrophoresis is easy method and can be used for small ions to macromolecules like proteins, peptides, chiral compounds, nucleic acid. The electrophoresis involves the migration of ions and the opposite charged ions are attracted towards to the oppositely charged electrodes.
