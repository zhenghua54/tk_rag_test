But the truth about protein is that many people don't need as much as they are taking in. Adults in the U.S. are encouraged to get 10% to 35% of their day's calories from protein foods. That's about 46 grams of protein for women, and 56 grams of protein for men. It's not hard to get this amount if you eat two to three servings of protein-rich foods a day, according to the CDC. 1  A small 3-ounce piece of meat has about 21 grams of protein. 2  One 8-ounce container of yogurt has about 11 grams of protein. 3  One cup of milk has 8 grams of protein. 4  One cup of dry beans has about 16 grams of protein.
