UK CORRUPTION. Although corruption is not endemic in the UK, there are significant problems which need to be addressed. Transparency International UK (TI-UK)’s recent Corruption in the UK report highlighted corruption vulnerabilities in some of Britain’s key sectors and institutions. In 2011 Transparency International UK (TI-UK) launched the major findings from a series of studies which examine corruption in the UK. The reports – which represent the most comprehensive research ever undertaken in this area – examine the levels of corruption in 23 UK sectors and institutions.
