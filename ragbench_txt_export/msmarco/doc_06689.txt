One of the most common ways to eat Zaatar is to have a ” Man’ouche” , a flat bread dough with zaatar and olive oil. Here’s how to do it the easy way! Use a pizza dough for the flat bread. Mix 2-3 tablespoons of Zaatar with olive oil till you get a rather liquid paste. Pour over the dough and cook in oven till crispy. It’s that important! Zaatar has an amazing and unique flavor that is aromatic, and tangy at the same time. In arabic, Zaatar means thyme; it is actually a blend of dried thyme, sesame seeds and sumac.
