If you paid the $99 for AppleCare+ for your iPad (available only within 30 days of purchase), and your tablet suffers accidental damage, Apple will replace your broken iPad up to twice, for $49 each time, during the two-year coverage period. Otherwise, getting it fixed by Apple can cost you $200 to $300 dollars. You can also take this opportunity to switch from a black iPad model to a white one, if you like. We bought this screen for our damaged iPad 2 on Amazon for $30. It came with no instructions of any kind, and the reviews from buyers suggested seeking out YouTube videos to walk you through the process.
