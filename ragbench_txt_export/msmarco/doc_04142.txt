1 People with a family history â€” Some autoimmune diseases run in families, such as lupus and multiple sclerosis. 2  It is also common for different types of autoimmune diseases to affect different members of a single family. 3  Inheriting certain genes can make it more likely to get an autoimmune disease. Although each disease is unique, many share hallmark symptoms, such as fatigue, dizziness, and low-grade fever. For many autoimmune diseases, symptoms come and go, or can be mild sometimes and severe at others. When symptoms go away for a while, it's called remission. Flares are the sudden and severe onset of symptoms.
