In the systemic circulation, arteries bring oxygenated blood to the tissues. As blood circulates through the body, oxygen diffuses from the blood into cells surrounding the capillaries, and carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood from the capillary cells. Veins bring deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Capillaries are where veins become arteries (or vice versa). They have very thin walls (only once cell thick), so oxygen can diffuse into the surrounding tissue and waste products (like carbon dioxide) can diffuse in and be removed from the body.
