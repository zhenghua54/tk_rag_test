Right at 28 days after the breeding is when you should stick in the nestbox. The doe will typically have the babies right at 30 days. If she doesn't have them by the end of the 32nd day she will not have them and you can pull the nestbox out. Rabbits only milk about once to twice a day. Some breeders check two weeks after they mate their rabbit buy re-breeding. This isn't all that great of an idea, as rabbits can just keep mating, and she can carry multiple litters. At about 2-3 weeks you'll be able to feel the babies in her stomach. She'll also be moody and wont want to be handled.
