1 Costs for a facelift usually range from $6,000 to $15,000, including an anesthesia fee of $1,000 to $1,300, a hospital fee of $500 to $2,000 and a surgeon's fee. 2  A face lift will take more time, and cost more, for a patient with whose skin is less pliable or has been subjected to years of too much sun exposure. 1 It is not uncommon to pay as much as $25,000 for a facelift combined with other procedures. 2  Some plastic surgery patients require additional surgery, either because they are unhappy with the results or experience complications. 3  This corrective surgery can cost as much as, or more than, the initial procedure.
