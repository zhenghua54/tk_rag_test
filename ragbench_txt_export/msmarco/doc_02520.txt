Comparing the ECOG Performance Status to the Karnofsky Performance Status. The ECOG Performance Status and the Karnofsky Performance Status are two widely used methods to assess the functional status of a patient. It is also a way for physicians to track changes in a patientâ€™s level of functioning as a result of treatment during the trial. The scale was developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), now part of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, and published in 1982.
