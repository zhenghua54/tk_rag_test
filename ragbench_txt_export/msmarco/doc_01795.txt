A compiler is a program that translates human readable source code into computer executable machine code. To do this successfully the human readable code must comply with the syntax rules of whichever programming language it is written in. The compiler is only a program and cannot fix your programs for you. This output from Lexical Analyzer goes to the Syntactical Analyzer part of the compiler. This uses the rules of grammar to decide whether the input is valid or not. Unless variables A and B had been previously declared and were in scope, the compiler might say. ' 1 A' : undeclared identifier.
