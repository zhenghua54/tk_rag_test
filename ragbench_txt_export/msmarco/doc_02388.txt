The piping is a form of plastic resin that was used extensively for water supply piping between the years of 1978 and 1995. It’s estimated that 1 out of 5 homes had polybutylene piping installed within the years of manufacturing. Over time, polybutylene piping loses its strength and becomes brittle, sometimes even scaling or flaking. Micro-fractures result and the basic structural integrity of the system is reduced. It’s believed that the oxidants in water, such as chlorine, are what cause polybutylene to break down and lose its resilience.
