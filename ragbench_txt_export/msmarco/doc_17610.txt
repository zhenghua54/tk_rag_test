To find an institution at the post-secondary level: Step 1: Select the province/territory in which your institution is located. A list of all the designated learning institutions in that province/territory will appear. Step 2: To search for a specific institution, type in any key words (partial name of the institution or the city in which the institution is located). Important Note: This list will be updated on a regular basis. To apply for a study permit on or after June 1, 2014, you will need a letter of acceptance from a designated learning institution. You need to include the Designated Learning Institution number (DLI #), which is the number that begins with the letter “O”, on your application form. All primary and secondary schools in Canada are automatically designated. They do not appear on this list
