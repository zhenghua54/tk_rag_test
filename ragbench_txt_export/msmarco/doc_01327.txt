There is a difference between regular or original leather and PU leather. PU leather can be described as faux leather or synthetic leather. It sometimes consists of split leather combined with a layer of polyurethane which is embossed onto the surface. It is also referred to as bicast leather but has some similarities to original or genuine leather.
