Pathophysiology. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) converts pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which is one of the two essential substrates needed to produce citrate (see the image below). This diagram shows a simplified version of the citric acid cycle and shows the enzyme deficit. All children are born with some residual enzyme activity, because a complete deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is incompatible with life. Infants with 15% or less pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity normally do not survive the newborn period.
