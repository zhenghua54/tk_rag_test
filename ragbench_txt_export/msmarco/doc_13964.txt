Required Number of Jurors. Generally, a federal criminal jury is required to have 12 people. This requirement can be waived by the defendant. The 12-person jury requirement doesnâ€™t extend to the states. Jury instructions are the legal rules given by the court to the jurors by which they must follow during their deliberations. In a criminal case that requires the verdict to be unanimous, the court must instruct the jury of this requirement.
