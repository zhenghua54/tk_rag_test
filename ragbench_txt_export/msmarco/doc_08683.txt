Non-nursing moms: If you're formula-feeding your baby, you'll probably start menstruating one to three months after delivering your child. If you don't get your period by three months postpartum, talk to your doctor. She may want to check for secondary amenorrhea (that's when women with previously normal cycles don't have a period for three months), pregnancy, or other issues.
