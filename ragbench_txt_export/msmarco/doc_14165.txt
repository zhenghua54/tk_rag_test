Linus Carl Pauling (February 28, 1901 â€“ August 19, 1994) was an American chemist, biochemist, peace activist, author, and educator. He was named Linus Carl, in honor of Lucy's father, Linus, and Herman's father, Carl. In 1901, after his sister Pauline was born, Pauling's parents decided to move out of Portland, to find more affordable and spacious living quarters than their one-room apartment.
