Hamstring Overview. The hamstrings are a collection of three muscles located in the back of the thigh that are responsible for bending or flexing the knee. The hamstring muscle fibers gradually become tendon fibers near the knee to attach to bone. One can appreciate the thick tendon bands when feeling behind the knee joint. The hamstring muscle is balanced by the quadriceps muscles that are located on the front of the thigh and cause the knee to extend.
