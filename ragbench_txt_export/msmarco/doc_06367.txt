Conclusions. The dramatic difference in live-birth survival rates between 22 and 25 weeks’ gestational age (from 6% to 81%) confirms that with our current management practices 22 to 25 weeks’ GA is the threshold of viability. Background. Initiating resuscitation and intensive care for preterm infants is generally accepted from 26 weeks’ gestational age (GA) on.[ 1 ]-[ 3 ] By contrast, initial resuscitation and management of the extremely preterm infant born at 22 to 25 weeks’ GA is controversial.
