It depends are you paying cash or are you financing the home, if cash anywhere from 3 weeks to a little over a month, if your financing the home from 45 days to 2 months basically as long as it would take a normal real estate transaction. answer by Richard Williams | Contact Me. A guide line would be 2 weeks for cash on a bank owned foreclosure and 2 months on a non approved short sale, 1 month on an approved short sale. If you have a home that fits you and your price is 50-70% of previous market value hang in there until you succeed.
