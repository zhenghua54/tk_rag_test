Packing peanuts were invented in 1965 by Dow Chemical. There are two types of packing peanuts, those made from foam, and those made from starches like corn or grain sorghum. Polystyrene-based packing peanuts were invented in 1965 and have been used ever since. Polystyrene packing peanuts can be used over and over again and can be recycled at shipping stores around the world. Ever since the early 1990s, corn starch has been increasingly used to form packing peanuts. these are more environmentally-friendly as they can be dissolved in water. They are also non-toxic to humans and pets if accidentally ingested.
