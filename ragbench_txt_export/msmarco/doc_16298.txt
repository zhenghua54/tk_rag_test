Glass wool, which is one product called fiberglass today, was invented in 1932â€“1933 by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning, as a material to be used as thermal building insulation. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass (A for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A new type, E-glass, was formed; this is an alumino-borosilicate glass that is alkali This was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation.
