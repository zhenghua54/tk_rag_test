Focus your career path on research. Doctors and physicians who study diseases of the nervous system arenâ€™t as well paid as neurologists, neurosurgeons or psychiatrists. Salaries for a neuropathologist can range anywhere from $128,500 to $168,500 a year, but the average was closer to $148,500 as of 2012.
