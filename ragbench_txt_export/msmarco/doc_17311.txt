Abstract. The blood–brain barrier consists of endothelial cells lining brain capillaries. It serves to restrict and control the movement of substances between the general circulation and brain extracellular fluid. Figure 1. The blood–brain barrier consists of endothelial cells lining brain capillaries. These cells are connected by tight junctions, which separate the plasmalemma into luminal (blood‐facing) and abluminal (brain‐facing) plasma membrane domains.
