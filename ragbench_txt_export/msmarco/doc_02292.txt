Sometimes, however, bacteria from outside the body get into the urinary tract, and cause infection and inflammation. This is a urinary tract infection. The infection can involve the urethra (a condition called urethritis), kidneys (a condition called pyelonephritis) or bladder, (a condition called cystitis). A urinary tract infection causes the lining of the urinary tract to become red and irritated, which may produce some of the following symptoms: 1  Pain in the flank (side), abdomen or pelvic area. 2  Pressure in the lower pelvis.
