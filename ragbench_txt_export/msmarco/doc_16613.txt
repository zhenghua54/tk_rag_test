The safe and legal ways are a Furnace Transfer Switch or a Furnace Interlock Device. Both make sure your temporary power from a generator or inverter cannot mix with your grid power. A transfer switch can run $100 or more plus installation costs. An interlock device can be $50 and can be hard to find for just your furnace. My preference is to wire your furnace in such a way that it meets code, prevents mixing temporary and grid power and costs less than $10 per furnace in parts.
