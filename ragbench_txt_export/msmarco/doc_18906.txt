Shoulder Joint Injection. A shoulder joint injection is the injection of steroid in the subacromial bursa, acromioclavicular joint or glenohumeral joint. This injection is administered to relieve pain in the shoulder region. You may experience some “pressure” at the injection site and this may last up to an hour. Your pain may return and you may have some soreness at the injection site for a day or two. This is due to the mechanical process of needle insertion as well as initial irritation from the steroid itself.
