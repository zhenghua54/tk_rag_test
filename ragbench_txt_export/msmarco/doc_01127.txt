Esters are derived from carboxylic acids. A carboxylic acid contains the-COOH group, and in an ester the hydrogen in this group is replaced by a hydrocarbon group of some kind. This could be an alkyl group like methyl or ethyl, or one containing a benzene ring like phenyl. A common ester-ethyl ethanoate. The most commonly discussed ester is ethyl ethanoate. Animal and vegetable fats and oils are just big complicated esters. The difference between a fat (like butter) and an oil (like sunflower oil) is simply in the melting points of the mixture of esters they contain. If the melting points are below room temperature, it will be a liquid-an oil.
