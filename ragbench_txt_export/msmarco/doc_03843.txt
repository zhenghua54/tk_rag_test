Concentration is usually given by the molarity, or moles of solute (NaOH) per liter of solution. And has been mentioned already, the pH of the solution can tell you (indirectly) the concentration of the OH-ions and hence the concentration of NaOH. Or an acid/base titration can determine the concentration of the base. Lest you get into this issue again, let me urge the correct use of strength. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base. That was determined by Arrhenius about 125 years ago.
