A fairly typical quote for a provisional patent application (through filing) for a moderately complex mechanical innovation is $2,5000 for attorneys fees plus the cost of the provisional filing fee (typically $130) and the cost of any professional illustrations desired (typically $200 to $300). A provisional patent application lasts a maximum of 12 months and then goes abandoned. You must file a nonprovisional patent application within 12 months of the filing of the provisional patent application in order to continue to seek a utility patent.
