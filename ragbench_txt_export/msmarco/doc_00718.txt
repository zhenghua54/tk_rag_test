The thyroid gland is part of your endocrine system, which produces hormones that coordinate many of your body's activities. Doctors test your thyroid function to help detect Hashimoto's disease. Treatment of Hashimoto's disease with thyroid hormone replacement usually is simple and effective. 1  Symptoms.
