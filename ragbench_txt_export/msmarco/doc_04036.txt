I'm not sure if it's because we're eating these in February, but they smelled like a Hawaiian sunset. (Well, if a sunset could smell and I'm guessing on the Hawaii thing because I've never been there, but still.). I had read that guavas have a strong smell and anytime you read that, it seems like a warning. Not in this case. Keeping with our adventure of trying new foods, we decided to try guava today. I think I've had guava juice somehow or other in my life. I've never eaten an actual guava though before today. Honestly, the guavas at the grocery store looked a little suspect.
