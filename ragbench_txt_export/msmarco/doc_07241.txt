Pluto fails in this category. Thus it joins the other dwarf  planets, Ceres (which was called a planet longer than Pluto was),  and Eris, which is larger and more impressive than Pluto. Makemake  and Haumea are two more of our solar system's dwarf planets. Sedna,  Orcus, and Quaoar might also qualify as dwarf planets.
