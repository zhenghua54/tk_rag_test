We have discussed a mechanism for a short-term memory. It is short-term because the memory is transient and that is so because the underlying biochemical changes are transient. The duration of the memory is dependent on how long the various substrate proteins (e.g., membrane channels) are phosphorylated. The declarative memory system is the system of memory that is perhaps the most familiar. It is the memory system that has a conscious component and it includes the memories of facts and events. A fact like 'Paris is the capital of France', or an event like a prior vacation to Paris.
