Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, applying ice to the area (10 to 15 minutes every one to two hours) for the first day or two will help decrease the pain. In addition, you may benefit from taking acetaminophen (Tylenolâ„¢) to help reduce the pain. Usually a numbing medication is given with the injection, which can last for five to 12 hours. The actual Cortisone may take up to two to five days to take effect. If you develop any abnormal symptoms, such as itching, swelling, redness, rash, or shortness of breath, please call our office.
