Generally, trials last between three and five days. Please check the back of your Summons for any exceptions. Also, the judge will inform you the morning of jury selection as to how long the trial will last. Please inform the judge of any serious hardships at this time. The number of jurors that are selected depends on the type of case. For a civil trial, six to eight jurors may be selected. For a criminal trial, twelve to fourteen may be selected. The court always calls more jurors than needed for the jury selection process.
