Best Answer: Here are the breed standards, you can see for yourself. An important note is that the German Spitz comes in multiple sizes that are treated as separate breeds in most countries. http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/164 http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/161. There really isn't much difference unless you're looking for very subtle differences. So unless you're a breeder, cynologist, or dog showperson, it really doesn't matter. All Spitz are generally the same. German Spitz can also be a category of dog as opposed to a single breed. If you really want in-depth information, I would suggest going to www.AKC.com and searching for those breeds, looking them up on Wikipedia, or flipping through Dogalog (dog encyclopedia)
