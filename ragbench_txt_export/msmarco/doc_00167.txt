In fact WQL is Microsoft's implementation of the CIM Query Language (CQL), a query language for the Common Information Model (CIM) standard from the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). The query language is read only there is no INSERT or UPDATE keywords in it. In PowerShell we are not obligated to use WQL to pull information from WMI like shown in the other blog posts in the series where we queried information using Cmdlets parameters. We find that many of the examples we will see out there in Python, Perl, VBScript, C# and others actually WQL for performing their queries since there is some additional controls on what data to pull and to express the query in a more familiar way for others to understand what it is being done.
