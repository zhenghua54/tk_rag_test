Contrary to many forms of dwarfism (such as achondroplasia or other bone dysplasias), GH deficiency (GHD) (commonly referred to as “pituitary dwarfism”) and GH resistance are characterized by normal body proportions. Clinically, growth hormone deficiency or defects in its binding to receptor are seen as growth retardation or dwarfism. Conversely, excess secretion of growth hormone prior to fusion of the epiphysial growth plates results in gigantism.
