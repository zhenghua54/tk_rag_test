Cartilage: The three types of cartilage. There are three types of cartilage: 1  Hyaline-most common, found in the ribs, nose, larynx, trachea. 2  Is a precursor of bone. 3  Fibro-is found in invertebral discs, joint capsules, ligaments. 4  Elastic-is found in the external ear, epiglottis and larynx. Hyaline cartilage has widely dispersed fine collagen fibres (type II), which strengthen it. The collagen fibres are hard to see in sections. It has a perichondrium, and it is the weakest of the three types of cartilage. Look at the eMicroscope of a section of cartilage on the left.
