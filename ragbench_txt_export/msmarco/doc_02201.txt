Scanning electron micrograph of a phagocyte (yellow: neutrophil) engulfing some bacteria (orange: anthrax bacilli). Phagocytes are the white blood cells that protect the body by eating (phagocytosing) dirt, bacteria and dead or dying cells. They are important for fighting infections. They are also important for becoming immune. Phagocytes are important in all animals and are very complex in vertebrates.
