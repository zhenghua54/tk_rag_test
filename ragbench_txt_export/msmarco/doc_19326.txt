Prescription drug abuse is a widespread problem, and Xanax addiction is one of the most common addictions to a drug that’s widely prescribed. Used since the 1960s, Xanax is listed on the Controlled Substance Act as a Schedule IV controlled substance. It’s used for anxiety, stress, panic attacks, nervousness and tension springing from any or all of those problems, so it’s widely prescribed in a psychiatric setting.
