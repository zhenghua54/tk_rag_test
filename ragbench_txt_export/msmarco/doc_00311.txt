In an effort to improve the chances of obtaining financing for your startup you may have heard that buying a shelf corp will open the credit floodgates for your new venture. There are bank ratings, credit history, NSF history, and other factors to consider especially if you request more than a $50k line of credit. So if your interest is in applying for bank financing keep in mind shelf corporations have no business history, tax returns, financials and existing revenue.
