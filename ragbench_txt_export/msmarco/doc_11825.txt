Alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs that perform gas exchange. That is the main process of respiration where the body gets rid of carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen which is us â€¦ ed in metabolism.   They have supply of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood surrounding their surface giving them a high blood supply. The deoxygenated blood from the right side of the Heart is carried to the Lungs. At the level of the Alveoli's, the air exchange takes place where carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen taken up.
