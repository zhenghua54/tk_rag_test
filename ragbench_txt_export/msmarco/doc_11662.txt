Launched in spring 2010, Sledgehammer produces big, bold red wines. The inaugural releases Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel are made from grapes grown in Californiaâ€™s North coast winegrowing region. We extend hang time to develop riper flavors and age the wines for two years in toasted oak barrels for added complexity.
