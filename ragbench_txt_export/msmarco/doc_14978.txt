Partially cook the bacon in a microwave or skillet prior to wrapping asparagus. You will need to secure it to asparagus with toothpicks. If bacon is not cooked ahead, toothpicks may be used but the bacon will usually hold in place if you cook it with both ends on hot surface first. To cook on grill, spray wrapped asparagus with olive oil or cooking spray. Place directly on hot grill or on hot foil on grill.
