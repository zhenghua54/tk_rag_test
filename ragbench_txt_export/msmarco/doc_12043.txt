To browse all area codes, we have a list of all United States area codes by state and area codes by number. The area code list includes a printable copy that you can print and use for reference. For international numbers, we also include Canadian area codes. The next three digits of a landline number or cellphone number are called the NXX. The NXX is also known as the prefix or exchange. Various telephone carriers will reserve blocks of telephone numbers by reserving an NXX within an area code. Like area codes, not all prefixes are currently in use.
