To find an agency near you, call the hotline at (800) 424-2246 or visit the Child Care Aware website. The website features a helpful tool that tells you the average cost of home daycare and daycare centers in your zip code. Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages. And daycare – whether in a center or in someone's home – could cost double or triple per month in a relatively expensive city compared to a cheaper area.
