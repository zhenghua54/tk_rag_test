RouterOS is a stand-alone operating system based on the Linux v2.6 kernel, and our goal here at MikroTik is to provide all these features with a quick and simple installation and an easy to use interface. You can try RouterOS today, go to www.mikrotik.com and download the installation CD image. It can also be installed on a PC and will turn it into a router with all the necessary features-routing, firewall, bandwidth management, wireless access point, backhaul link, hotspot gateway, VPN server and more.
