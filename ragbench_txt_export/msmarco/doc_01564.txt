Although the hypothalamus does not produce the hormones of the anterior pituitary as in the posterior pituitary, it plays an important role in their production. Releasing hormones synthesized by hypothalamic neurons travel down axons and diffuse into the primary plexus of the hypophyseal portal system. It does not produce its own hormones, but only stores and releases the hormones created by the hypothalamus, whereas the anterior pituitary produces and secretes its own hormones. Posterior Pituitary. ADH and oxytocin are produced in neuronal cell bodies of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus.
