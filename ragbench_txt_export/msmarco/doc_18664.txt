During the January 11, 1975 episode of All in the Family, titled The Jeffersons Move Up, Edith Bunker gave a tearful good-bye to her neighbor Louise Jefferson, as her husband George, their son Lionel, and she moved from a working-class section of Queens, New York into a luxury apartment in Manhattan. The Jeffersons premiered the following week, January 18, 1975, and 253 episodes were produced and aired during its 11-year run. George's career as a dry-cleaner began in the first season of All in the Family, in the episode Oh, My Aching Back (though the character himself did not appear on-camera).
