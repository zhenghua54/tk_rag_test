Hypoglycemia refers to blood sugar levels that drop below the normal range. When blood sugar becomes too low, the body releases a hormone called epinephrine (adrenaline), which causes the body to release stored sugar into the blood. If you notice any of these signs or symptoms, check your blood sugar. If it is low, eat or drink a source of quick sugar -- like 5-6 pieces of hard candy, 3-4 glucose tablets, or 6 ounces of fruit juice or soft drink (not diet). Check your blood sugar again in 15 minutes.
