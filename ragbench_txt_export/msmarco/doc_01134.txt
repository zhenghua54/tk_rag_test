Carboxylic acids also react with alcohols to give esters. This process is heavily used in the production of polyesters. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. The general formula of a carboxylic acid is Râˆ’C(O)OH with R referring to the rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule. Carboxylic acids occur widely and include the amino acids and acetic acid (as vinegar). Salts and esters of carboxylic acids are called carboxylates.
