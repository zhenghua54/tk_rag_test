Shopping for a patio: 1  Building a patio is just the beginning; furniture, plants, a barbecue, an electric outdoor heater and other accessories can add $200-$5,000 or more to the total cost. The removal cost is about $900, and the remaining $2,650 is the cost for paver, garden walls and a step. The patio design includes some curves, while the majority of the area was paved with the Herringbone pattern.
