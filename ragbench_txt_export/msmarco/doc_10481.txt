Inflorescence can also be defined as the reproductive portion of a plant that bears a cluster of flowers in a specific pattern. Strictly speaking this kind of inflorescence could be called umbelliform cyme, although it is normally called simply 'umbel'. Another kind of definite simple inflorescence is the raceme-like cyme or botryoid; that is as a raceme with a terminal flower and is usually improperly called 'raceme'.
