By April Johnson. The salaries of occupational therapy aides depend heavily on the employer, the state in which they are employed, and how much experience they have prior to starting the job. For those who have some experience, salaries may be a little higher. The Bureau of Labor and Statistics report for May 2014 shows the average annual salary for occupational therapy aides was $26,550. The top 10 percent earned about $44,220 annually, and the lowest 10 percent earned approximately $18,030 annually.
