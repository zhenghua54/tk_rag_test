There is no flat rate for building inspections, as the fee will depend on the size of your property. On the lower end of the scale, an inspection of a small property might only cost between $200 and $300. For an average sized house in a regional area, the cost is usually somewhere between $400 and $500. In metropolitan areas, a complete inspection can be closer to $800 or up to $1000. Pest inspections are less extensive and so tend to cost less. Expect to shell out around $100-$150 for a pest inspection.
