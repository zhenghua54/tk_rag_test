Right-click one of the libraries and select Properties. Click the Add button to add a new folder and select a folder in your OneDrive folder. You may need to create a new folder in OneDrive for this. Add that folder to the library, then select it and click Set save location. Files you save to the library will now automatically be saved to the folder on OneDrive and synchronized across your computers.
