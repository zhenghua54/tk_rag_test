An example of a dihybrid crosses of two pea varieties that differ in seed color and form. Dihybrid cross is a cross between two pure lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In Mendelian sense, between the alleles of both these loci there is a relationship of complete dominance-recessive. For example: RRYY/rryy parents result in F 1 offspring that are heterozygous for both R and Y (RrYy). The rules of meiosis, as they apply to the dihybrid, are codified in Mendel's first law and Mendel's second law, which are also called the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively.
