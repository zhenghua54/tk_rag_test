The average climate for the coniferous forest each year falls below -32°F. This biome can also be as low as -76°F. In the summer, the temperature can reach as high as 104°F. Fall is the shortest season and spring brings flowers and animals that wake up from hibernation. But when summertime finally comes around, the forest can get up to 20 hours of sunlight. Summer rain gives the forest an average of 10-20 inches of rain per year, and in winter snow is always on the ground.
