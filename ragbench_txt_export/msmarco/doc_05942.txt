The right atrium pumps blood through the right atrioventricular (tricuspid) valve to the right ventricle. From the right ventricle, blood flows through the pulmonary valve to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries (deoxygenated blood). In the lungs the blood becomes more red in color as it is oxygenated. Blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood) to the left atrium.
