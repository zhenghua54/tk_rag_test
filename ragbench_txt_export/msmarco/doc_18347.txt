The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Tuition and Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Tuition and fees paid during a semester may include Basic Tuition, mandatory campus fees, Nonresident Tuition, Professional Program fees, Course fees and Parking fees. Other miscellaneous fees may be charged to a student during their time here at SDSU.
