Yttrium reacts with water to form yttrium hydroxide plus hydrogen gas. Yttrium is often used as an additive in alloys, increasing the strength of aluminum and magnesium alloys. It is also used as a detoxifier for non-ferrous metals such as vanadium. It is used as a catalyst in ethylene polymerization. Yttrium oxide is the most important compound of yttrium. It is used to make the high-temperature superconductor YBCO (yttrium barium copper oxide) and it is used to produce phosphors, which provide the red color in color television tubes.
