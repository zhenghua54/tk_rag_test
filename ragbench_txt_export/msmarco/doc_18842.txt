Slugs and snails carry the lungworm larvae, and dogs can become infected when they accidentally (or purposefully) eat these common garden pests whilst rummaging through undergrowth, eating grass, drinking from puddles or outdoor water bowls, or pick them up from their toys. The lungworm (Angiostrongylus vasorum) is not known to infect humans. However, dogs and cats can carry roundworms, which can cause diseases in people, so make sure you keep your pet’s parasite protection programme up-to-date. You can find out more about Roundworm at the It’s a jungle website.
