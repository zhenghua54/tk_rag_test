Nitrobenzene is an organic compound with the chemical formula C6H5 NO2. It is a water-insoluble pale yellow oil with an almond-like odor. This mixture is sometimes called mixed acid.. The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (δ H = −117 kJ/mol). World capacity for nitrobenzene in 1985 was about 1.7×10 6 tonnes.
