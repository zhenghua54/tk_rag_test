In linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. This learned term derives from the Latin cognatus (blood relative). In linguistic research it is generally understood as excluding doublets and loan words, although broader definitions are used in other areas such as language teaching. False cognates are words that are commonly thought to be related (have a common origin), but which linguistic examination reveals to be unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb habÄ“re and German haben, both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates.
