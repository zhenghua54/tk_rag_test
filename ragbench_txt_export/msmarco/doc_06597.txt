How Does Tidal Energy Work. Tidal energy is energy obtained from changing sea levels (the tide moving from high to low and vice versa.) This renewable energy source has great potential as tides are much more predictable than wind power and solar energy which are not at all consistent (seasons, bad weather, etc...). The tidal range (difference between high and low tide) needs to be in excess of five metres for the barrage to be workable. As the tide comes in, water flows through the dam into the basin. Then when the tide stops the gates are closed, which traps the water in the basin/estuary.
