Cartilage is a type of connective tissue composed of special cells known as chondrocytes along with collagen or yellow elastic fibers. The fibers and the cells are embedded in a firm gel like matrix rich in mucopolysaccharides. Cartilage is not as hard and rigid as bone. It is much more flexible and elastic.
