For example, a typical loan forgiveness program might forgive 20 percent of the borrower’s student loans or $7,500, whichever is less, for each year of service up to five years. Loan Repayment Assistance Programs (LRAP) are an example of such loan forgiveness programs. Public Service Loan Forgiveness forgives the principal and interest balance on a borrower’s federal direct student loans after the borrower has made 120 qualifying payments (= 10 years) while working full-time in a public service job.
