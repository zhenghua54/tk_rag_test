The sphenopalatine ganglion is a collection of nerve fibers that is found inferior to the nose within the pterygopalatine fossa. The sphenopalatine ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion that contains sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory roots. This collection of nerve fibers supplies the paranasal sinuses, lacrimal gland, mucosa glands of the pharynx and nasal cavity, the gingiva, and the glands and mucous membranes of the hard palate. A sphenopalatine ganglion block is a minimally invasive procedure that is performed in an outpatient setting. Physicians have various methods that they can choose from to anesthetize the sphenopalatine ganglion, including the transnasal, transoral, and lateral approach.
