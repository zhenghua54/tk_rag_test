ALL excitatory neurotransmitters cause an opening of ligand-gated sodium ion channels. As a result, sodium ions flow in and the cell becomes less negative on the inside. When we talk about acetylcholine, it activates ACh receptor sites and ligand gated sodium ion channels open. Contrast that with exitatory NTs: All excitatory neurotransmitters cause an opening of ligand-gated sodium ion channels. The inhibitory NT could also cause an opening up of ligand-gated Chloride I
