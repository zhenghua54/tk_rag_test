Causes of Reversible Cerebral cortical Atrophy. Common causes of reversible cerebral atrophy are related to dehydration and starvation. Addison's disease or other causes of dehydration and abnormal fluid balance occasionally present with cerebral cortical atrophy on CT and may be reversible with treatment. In brain it means loss of neurons and the in between connections. Atrophy can be generalized and diffuse, which means that all parts of the brain affected equally or it can be focal, affecting only a limited area of the brain with a relatively decreased of the functions of that area of the brain.
