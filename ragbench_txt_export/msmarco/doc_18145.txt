Best Answer: In the United States, you can carry as much cash as you want. There are limits, though, on how you can use large quantities of cash. For instance, if you carry $20,000 in cash to a car dealer, the dealer has to report the transaction to the authorities. The reason is that drug dealers, smugglers, and other criminals tend to work entirely in cash.
