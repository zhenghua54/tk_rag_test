You can perform a better test with 1.5 volt and 9 volt batteries. Do not use this method with other types of batteries! Move the meter's selector to the battery test position in the upper right between ACV and DCA. Again touch the red probe to the positive terminal and the black to the negative. The display should show about 9 volts depending on the condition of the battery. Repeat the test with a 1.5 volt AA battery. If you inadvertently connect the probes to the incorrect terminals the display will show a negative voltage. This will not damage the meter. Note: Measuring battery voltage in this way does not really perform a very good test as the batteries are not under load
