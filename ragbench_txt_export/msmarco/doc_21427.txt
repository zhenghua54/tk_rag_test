DNA contain the deoxyribose sugar. Other differences may include; DNA is double stranded while RNA is single stranded DNA contain the base thymine while RNA contain the base Uracil in place of thymine. The sugar present in RNA molecule is ribose and in DNA molecule it is deoxyribose. Deoxyribose is the same as ribose, except that the former has one more OH. Deoxyribose sugar is less reactive because of C-H bond and ribose sugar is more reactive because of C-OH bonds. Lola Â· 2 years ago.
