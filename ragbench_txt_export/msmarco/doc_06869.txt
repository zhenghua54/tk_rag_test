Break up the ground where you will be planting your onions so the soil is loose. Spread four inches of compost or a well-rotted manure over the soil and use the shovel to turn the soil and mix the compost in. Drag a hand trowel or garden hoe through the soil to create a shallow trench only one inch deep. The mild taste of the Walla Walla onion can add a sweet flavor to any dish or meal where it can be used raw for the best taste.
