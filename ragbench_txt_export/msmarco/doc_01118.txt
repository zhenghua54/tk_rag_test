The piggyback endorsement clearly begins its coverage as of the date of the underlying policy and only provides insurance for the period from that date through the effective date of the endorsement. In other respects this type of endorsement is very similar to a date down endorsement. Ordinarily, a letter report is presented to the relevant parties showing what documents have been filed during the period from the policy date to the current date of the county records.
