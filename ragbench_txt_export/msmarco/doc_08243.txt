Hotel operators must collect sales tax on the room rate or rental charge for hotel occupancy, unless the charge is $2.00 or less per day. A room remarketer (such as an Internet travel site) is considered to be a hotel operator and must collect sales tax on the charge to its customers for hotel occupancy. The room rate or rental charge is the amount that guests must pay to stay in the hotel room (or to have the right to use the hotel room). This amount is taxable at the full state and local sales tax rate. See Tax Bulletin Sales Tax Rates, Additional Taxes, and Fees (TB-ST-825) .
