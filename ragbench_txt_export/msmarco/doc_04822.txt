Kayak/canoe rentals are around $30 per half day and $40 for a full day. If you want to try the sport out, or just see if you like it, it would probably be best to start with a rental somewhere. If you would prefer an inflatable kayak for easy portability and storage the price range is roughly $100 - $2000. With an average good quality one costing anywhere between $250 and $1000.
