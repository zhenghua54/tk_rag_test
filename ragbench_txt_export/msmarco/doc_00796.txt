By Sally Robertson, BSc. The term fibrosis describes the development of fibrous connective tissue as a reparative response to injury or damage. Fibrosis may refer to the connective tissue deposition that occurs as part of normal healing or to the excess tissue deposition that occurs as a pathological process. When fibrosis occurs in response to injury, the term “scarring” is used. Pulmonary fibrosis refers to a number of conditions that cause interstitial lung damage, followed by fibrosis and eventually loss of lung elasticity. These conditions lead to symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, difficulty breathing and fatigue.
