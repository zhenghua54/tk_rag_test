Introduction. Atherosclerosis is a slow disease in which your arteries become clogged and hardened. It is the underlying cause of most cases of heart attack, stroke, and vascular dementia, and is found in 80 to 90% of Americans over the age of 30. Fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances form plaque, which builds up in arteries. Hard plaque narrows the passage that blood flows through. That causes arteries to become stiff and inflexible (atherosclerosis is also known as hardening of the arteries).
