Definition of Gametes. Gametes are the reproductive cells used during sexual reproduction to produce a new organism called a zygote. The gametes in males and females are different. The male gamete is called sperm. It is much smaller than the female gamete and very mobile. Gametes are the cells used during sexual reproduction to produce a new individual organism or zygote. The male gamete, sperm, is a smaller, mobile cell that meets up with the much larger and less mobile female gamete, egg or ova. Both sperm and egg are only haploid cells. They only carry half of the chromosomes needed.
