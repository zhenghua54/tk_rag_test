Red watermelons are most prevalent and take five days for germination when temperatures are in the mid or upper 70s Fahrenheit. Seeds planted in higher temperatures, like the low or mid 80s, make take only four days to sprout into a seedling. For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees. Position the seeds no more than 5 feet away from each other, so the seedlings have room to mature into large fruit.
