Up to 20 percent of people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. Most of these people will develop arthritis within the knees, hips, ankles, elbows, or wrists. These are known as peripheral joints. About 5 percent will develop the condition in the spine. Males and females are equally likely to develop enteropathic arthritis. It is more common in teenagers and young adults.
