The digitizer is what translates your taps and gestures into input on the iPad. If your LCD panel is also damaged, you can replace that at the same time (the LCD panel sits right underneath the front glass). But for just the screen and the digitizer, you can pick up a kit online in the $50 to $100 range. You can also take this opportunity to switch from a black iPad model to a white one, if you like. We bought this screen for our damaged iPad 2 on Amazon for $30. It came with no instructions of any kind, and the reviews from buyers suggested seeking out YouTube videos to walk you through the process.
