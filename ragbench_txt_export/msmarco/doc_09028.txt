Overview. Cantaloupe is a summer treat that is suitable for many home gardens. When ripe, these melons have sweet, orange flesh that is used in fruit salads or served on its own. A warm-season plant, cantaloupe doesn't tolerate frost and cool soil temperatures inhibit germination. Planting cantaloupe indoors allows you to control the climate properly to ensure germination, while also protecting the young plants from disease and insects until they become established. Cover the pots with a plastic bag, which helps preserve moisture in the soil during germination. Set the pots in a warm, 75 to 90 degree Fahrenheit, room to germinate. Best germination occurs at 90 F.
