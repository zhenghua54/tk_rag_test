Basketball courts come in different sizes and colors. In the NBA, the court is 94 feet (29 m) by 50 feet (15 m). Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly 28 metres (92 ft) by 15 metres (49 ft). A high school court is slightly smaller, at 84 feet (26 m) by 50 feet (15 m). In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always 10 feet (3.0 m) above the floor (except possibly in youth competition).
