Today we released the fiscal year (FY) 2015 travel per diem rates, which will take effect on October 1, 2014. By law, each year GSA sets these rates for the Continental United States. GSA has released the FY 2015 per diem rates for federal travelers. In addition to setting per diem rates, GSA also provides agencies with travel policies and tools to further reduce costs.
