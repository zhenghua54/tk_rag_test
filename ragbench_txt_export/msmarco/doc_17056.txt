Boosting the soil's fertility levels before planting watermelon seeds ensures quick germination and seedling establishment. For the best results with watermelons, use 3 pounds of 5-10-10 fertilizer for every 100 square feet of planting space. Simply scoop the seeds out of a watermelon, rinse them under water to remove any fruit pieces or fruit juices, and let them air-dry on a paper towel. In general, watermelon seeds stay viable for approximately four years. However, the longer you wait, the lower your chances of optimal germination.
