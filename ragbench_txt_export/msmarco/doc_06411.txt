Fallopian tubes can be blocked because of scarring caused by injury or infection, but the underlying cause of the condition is sometimes unknown. Although common, blocked fallopian tubes are rarely a cause for serious concern. Since pain from the condition is rare, and not all women notice or experience infertility, it is not uncommon for women with blocked tubes to go several years without knowing about their conditions. It is possible that millions of women actually have blocked fallopian tubes that are undiagnosed.
