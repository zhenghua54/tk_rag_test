Crape myrtle is a tough plant that needs little in the way of fertilizer or pruning. It likes light and warmth, so plant it where it will get full sun all day. Give it extra water during dry periods for the first two years after planting, and it should be able to fend for itself after that. Smaller cultivars of crape myrtle can be planted in groups to use as a hedge or screen. Some of these grow to a compact 3 feet tall and can be planted three feet from a building wall.
