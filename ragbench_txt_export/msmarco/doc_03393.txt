Fossil fuels are energy resources that come from the remains of plants and animals. These remains are millions of years old. There are three fossil fuels: petroleum oil, natural gas, and coal. Fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and natural gas, provide the energy that powers our lifestyles and our economy. Fossil fuels power everything from the planes in the sky to the cars on the road.
