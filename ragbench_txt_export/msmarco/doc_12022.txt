Count Alfred von Schlieffen in 1906. The Schlieffen Plan (German: Schlieffen-Plan, [ʃliːfən plaːn]) was adopted as Aufmarsch I (Deployment [Plan] I) in 1905 (later Aufmarsch I West) and modelled a Franco-German war, which would not involve Russia but was expected to include Italy and Austria-Hungary as German allies. A decisive first campaign would lead to the defeat of France. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and became convinced that an isolated Franco-German war was impossible, given the Franco-Russian solidarity shown during the Moroccan Crises (1905 and 1911) and Bosnian Crisis (1908).
