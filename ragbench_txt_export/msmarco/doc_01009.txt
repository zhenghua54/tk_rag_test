If you apply for 2 Southwest credit cards and spend $2,000 on each of them and the points post to your account in 2013, you will have earned 104,000 points out of the 110,000 points needed for the Southwest Companion Pass. The points posted to my Southwest account on November 19, 2012 (1 day) and they counted towards the Companion Pass. However, the terms said â€œ Please allow up to 4-6 weeks for the miles to appear in your frequent flyer account.
