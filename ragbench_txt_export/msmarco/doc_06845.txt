When Glowstone is destroyed, it can drop anywhere from two to four pieces of Glowstone Dust, therefore destroying n amount of Glowstone Blocks won't necessarily mean you can make n Glowstone Blocks from the dust gathered. 1 A useful tactic for reaching clusters of Glowstone Blocks that are very high up is to redirect a Ghast's fireball at it. 2  This is only recommended if the cluster itself is over ground though, else the resulting dust could easily fall into the lava sea below.
