typically mesas have much larger tops that a butte and many feel that a mesa can only be called that if standing water can sometimes be found the grand mesa is an outstanding example of this kind of feature the definition difference between a butte and a mesa most likely originated right here in the southwest early settlers said that if you could find game on top it was a mesa eventually that definition translated to the idea that if you could graze cattle and find water it was a mesa not a butte
