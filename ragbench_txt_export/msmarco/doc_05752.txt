Goldfinger  was the title song from the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Composed by John Barry and with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, the song was performed by Shirley Bassey for the film's opening and closing title sequences, as well as the soundtrack album release. He hated it, saying That's the worst *** song I've ever heard in my *** life (Saltzman would also dislike Bassey's subsequent Bond theme, that for Diamonds Are Forever). However time constraints did not allow for the possibility of a replacement Goldfinger theme song being written and recorded.
