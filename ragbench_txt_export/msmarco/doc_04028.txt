Rates vary depending on the time of day and year as well as your location. If your target market is most likely to see your ad during the local news at noon, you may pay anywhere from $200 to $1,500 for a 30-second spot during that time, says Entrepreneur. Commercials that run between the prime viewing hours between 6 to 7 p.m. cost the most. National commercials produced by an advertising agency cost far more, averaging $342,000 for a 30-second spot in 2008, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
