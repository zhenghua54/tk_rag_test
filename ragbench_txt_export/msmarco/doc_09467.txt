What factors impact how long it takes to get a Social Security Disability approval? The first thing that will impact how quickly you get a response to your application for Social Security Disability is whether your initial disability claim is approved or denied. Initial claims usually take 30 to 90 days to process. Unfortunately, the process of being approved (or denied) can take a very long time. According to the Social Security Administration, the full SSD application and appeal process takes an average of 440 days. That's over a year.
