SMSF’s are permitted to invest in residential property as long as you don’t buy the property from a related party of a member. For example, you can’t own the family home through your super fund. Nor can you rent a residential property owned by your SMSF to a fund member, or to their related parties. Generally, your SMSF can buy a beach house that you rent out to tenants who are not members of the fund, their relatives, or other unrelated parties of your fund. We recommend that you speak with a financial adviser to help you decide if buying property through your super fund is right for you.
