Appearances. One of the obvious effects of littering is the negative impact it has on the appearance of an area. A litter-strewn location looks dirty and unsightly, making it a less pleasant environment for those that live in or use it. Litter that accumulates may also smell, further reducing the quality of a location. When littering becomes commonplace in an area, it sends the message that the practice is acceptable, and the result is that people continue to discard litter carelessly.
