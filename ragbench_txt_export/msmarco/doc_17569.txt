Gaelic Football is one of Ireland's two main national sports, the other being a sport called Hurling. At a first glance by the uneducated eye, it could look like a cross between soccer and rugby, but there is a lot more to it than that. Tipperary, Ireland, and it is now the governing body of Gaelic Football and some other sports.   The main two people who acted as founders of the GAA were Michael Cusack and Maurice Davin. There are some confusion as to who else was at that founding meeting.
