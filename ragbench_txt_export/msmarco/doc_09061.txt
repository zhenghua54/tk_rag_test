Diamagnetism. That branch of magnetism which treats of diamagnetic phenomena and of the properties of diamagnetic bodies. Diamagnetism is a property exhibited by substances with a negative magnetic susceptibility, that is, by substances which magnetize in a direction opposite to that of an applied magnetic field. A diamagnetic substance has a magnetic permeability less than 1, and is repelled when placed near a magnet. The induced magnetic moment J acquired by 1 mole of a diamagnetic substance is proportional to the intensity of the external field H, that is, J = Ï‡ H. The coefficient X is called the molar diamagnetic susceptibility and has a negative sign, since J and H have opposite directions.
