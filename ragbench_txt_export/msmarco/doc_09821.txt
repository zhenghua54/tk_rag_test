Q19: What information is available on Where's My Refund? Information on Where's My Refund? is for the most recent tax year we have on file for you. You can check on the status of your refund 24 hours after you e-file. If you filed a paper return, please allow 4 weeks before checking on the status. Many different factors can affect the timing of your refund after we receive it for processing. Even though we issue most refunds in less than 21 days, itâ€™s possible your tax return may require additional review and take longer. Also, if you are anticipating a refund, take into consideration the time it takes for your financial institution to post the refund to your account, or for mail delivery
