The nervous system is divided into two systems. The Central Nervous System which is the brain and the spinal cord, and the Peripheral Nervous System which is the 12 cranial nerves, 31 pairs of spinal nerves and ganglia. The Peripheral Nervous System provides communication between the brain and spinal cord and the bodyâ€™s muscles, glands and sensory receptors. The spinal nerves are named according to where it emerges and passes through the bones in the spinal vertebrae. As you can see in the image to the left, the nerve roots (in red) come off the spinal cord and out to the rest of the body between the vertebra.
