The petals on a Plumeria Obtusa flower are rounder than those of Plumeria Rubra, and they tend to bend over backwards at the very tips. The Plumeria Obtusa is also known as the evergreen frangipani, as, in the right climate, they will keep their leaves all year round. The leaves from a Plumeria Rubra are long and oval and have quite a pointed end. The leaves are quick to drop off as the winter coolness approaches. A Plumeria Rubra can grow to 5m tall and almost as wide.
