Uses of Copper Sulphate. Copper sulphate, blue stone, blue vitriol are all common names for pentahydrated cupric sulphate, CuSO 4 5H 2 O, which is the best known and the most widely used of the copper salts. Indeed it is often the starting raw material for the production of many of the other copper salts. Copper sulphate is a very versatile chemical with as extensive a range of uses in industry as it has in agriculture. Its principal employment is in agriculture, and, up to a generation or so ago, about its only uses in industry were as a mordant for dyeing and for electroplating.
