1 Calves are ideally weaned when they are 7 to 8 months old. 2  The right time to wean a calf depends on the condition of the cow and not the age of the calf. 3  Calves should be weaned before the condition score of the cow falls below 2,5 if adequate winter feed is available and the cows maintain their condition. 1 In the more western parts of the country calves can be weaned late in May or early June at the age of about 7 to 8 months as the breeding season tends to be later in these areas.
