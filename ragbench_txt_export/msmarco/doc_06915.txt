Of course, you don't have to seal again with a butter. Your need to seal twice may have to do with your porosity. If you have very porous hair, moisture may easily escape your strands and you may want to seal with both oil and a butter to ensure the moisture stays in for longer. Play around with sealing to see what your hair likes most!
