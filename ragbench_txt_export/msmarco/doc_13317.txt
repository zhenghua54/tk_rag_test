They leave seven months into the leave year having taken eight days off. This is the equivalent of 2.66 weeks (8 ÷ 3). Applying the formula above: 5.6 x (7 ÷ 12) – 2.66 = 0.61 weeks' leave to be paid in lieu. If you pay a worker on a daily basis, you can also work out their outstanding holiday entitlement in days. For example, a worker working five days per week is entitled to 5.6 weeks per year, the equivalent of 28 days (5.6 x 5). They leave three months into the year having taken four days off.
