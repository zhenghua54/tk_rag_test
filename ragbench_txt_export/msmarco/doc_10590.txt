Best Answer: Not American, unless you claim Sam Morey invented it. Invention required reducing to practice. Someone patenting something that may work if well developed is not inventing. First known gasoline powered engine was by Siegfried Marcus in 1870 in Vienna. A more successful gasoline engine was made by Daimler and Maybach, with Otto in 1879. The earlier engines mentioned by other folks were generally conceptual (i.e. not really invented yet), and/or used lighting gas (like natural gas), not gasoline.
