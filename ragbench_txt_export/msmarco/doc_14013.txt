the second letter of your pacemaker is always the site where the sensing takes place. a = atrial, v = ventricular, d = atrial and ventricular. the letter o (sometimes referred to as zero) means there is no sensing possibility in the pacemaker in the way it is set now. voo-this means the pacemaker paces in the ventricle (v)(most often the right ventricle) and doesn't sense anything (o) and as a result there is no action in the third letter either (o). this pacemaker mode means you get ventricular pacing regardless of the own rhythm of the patient
