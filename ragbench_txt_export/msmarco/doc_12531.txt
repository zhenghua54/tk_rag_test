The lamina propria which underlies the epithelium has a rich vascular and lymphatic network, which absorbs the digestive products, and there is a muscularis mucosae layer immediately at the base of the crypts. The lymphatic capillaries are called lacteals, and absorb lipids. The vascular capillaries are fenestrated to aid absorption. The muscularis externa layer contains two layers of smooth muscle, an inner circular and outer longitudinal, for continuous peristaltic activity of the small intestine.
