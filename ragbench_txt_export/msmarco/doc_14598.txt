A urine glucose test is a quick, easy way to check for abnormally high levels of glucose in the urine. You will be asked to urinate into a plastic laboratory cup. A lab technician can check glucose levels immediately by using a small cardboard device known as a dipstick. When too much glucose is found in the urine, the most common culprit is diabetes. Your doctor will probably refer you to an endocrinologist and a nutritionist to help plan the best strategies to get your glucose levels under control. Tell us what you think.
