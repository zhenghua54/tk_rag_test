1 The thymus gland, located behind your sternum and between your lungs, is only active until puberty. 2  After puberty, the thymus starts to slowly shrink and become replaced by fat. 3  Thymosin is the hormone of the thymus, and it stimulates the development of disease-fighting T cells. Throughout your childhood years, white blood cells called lymphocytes pass through the thymus, where they are transformed into T cells. Once T cells have fully matured in the thymus, they migrate to the lymph nodes (groups of immune system cells) throughout the body, where they aid the immune system in fighting disease.
