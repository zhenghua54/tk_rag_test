The book tells of FitzPatrick's travels with his dog, Jock, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, during the 1880s, when he worked as a storeman, prospector's assistant, journalist and ox-wagon transport-rider in the Bushveld region of the Transvaal (then the South African Republic). Jock of the Bushveld is a true story by South African author Sir James Percy FitzPatrick.
