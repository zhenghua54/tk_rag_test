Now, on to the question--how much money does a marine biologist make? The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates median wages of all biologists at $31.98 hourly and $66,510 annually in their May 2009 survey. Average entry-level salaries for qualified marine biologists joining consulting firms, and those teaching biology at high schools range from $35000 to $40000 a year.
