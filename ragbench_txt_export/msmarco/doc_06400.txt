Description. Pituitary dwarfism is caused by problems arising from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, also called the hypophysis, is a gland at the base of the brain that produces many different hormones. This gland is divided into the anterior (front) and posterior (back) halves. There are many forms of dwarfism. The word pituitary is in reference to the pituitary gland in the body. This gland regulates certain chemicals (hormones) in the body. Therefore, pituitary dwarfism is decreased bodily growth due to hormonal problems.
