In the ground they serve up real ales (including 'Saracens Ale', which was chosen by the fans prior to their move), cider, craft lagers. There is a large public bar in the East Stand that can cater for 1,000 thirsty supporters, and several smaller bars dotted around the ground. Today the club is home to a significant number of South African-born players amongst a number of other nationalities. In 2006, Saracens moved home ground (something of a trend over the years!) to Vicarage Road, the home of Watford Football Club where the club remained until 2013.
