Glucose from blood enters the brain by a transport protein. Glucose is the primary energy substrate of the brain. Glucose transport protein (GLUT-1) is highly enriched in brain capillary endothelial cells. These transporters carry glucose molecules through the blood brain barrier. 11.1 Blood-brain Barrier Maintains the Constancy of the Brain's Internal Environment. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the neural tissue from variations in blood composition and toxins.
