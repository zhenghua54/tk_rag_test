â€¢ Intolerances and Allergies: If your pet is sensitive to certain foods, eating those foods will cause negative reactions. For example, many cats are intolerant to lactose in milk, leading to diarrhoea and vomiting when consumed. Some pets suffer from food intolerances, which can also lead to vomiting. Although eating too quickly may be a one-off or a regular occurrence, it can lead to indigestion and vomiting. The best way to combat this is to feed small meals regularly throughout the day. Some breed-specific diets (eg Labradors) help slow their rate of ingestion. You could also try a scoff-stopper bowl.
