Slanetz and Bartley agar (SlaBa agar) is a selective medium, which is used for surface streaking and enumeration of Enterococcus spp. in drinking water, beverages and other biological products of animal origin. The other half (B) is covered with E. coli-agar. Most pathogens of the urinary tract grow on CLED agar and if they are lactose fermenting, the colour of CLED agar changes from green to yellow. The MacConkey agar is used to grow mainly gram negative bacteria.
