There is one way to keep the costs of terrazzo flooring down, and that is to use terrazzo tile. These are pre-made tiles using the terrazzo technique. Instead of having to hire a contractor to make the entire floor using small pieces, homeowners can hire contractors to lay down the tiles. Minimum cost - $20 per square foot. Maximum cost - $100 per square foot. The cost of terrazzo flooring is directly related to the materials out of which the floor itself is made.
