1 Use the equation PV = nRT to calculate the initial pressure of the SO 3 (g). 2  Use the equation pV = nRT to calculate the equilibrium partial pressure of the O 2 (g).inally, the equation Kp = Kc(RT) is used to calculate a value for Kp again, but this time from the value of Kc. Problem 2 involves calculating the equilibrium molar amounts of reactants and products, and then their partial pressures, from which a value for Kp can be obtained.
