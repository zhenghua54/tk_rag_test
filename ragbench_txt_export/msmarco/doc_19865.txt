The Two Seed Types of Flowering Plants. The flowering plants, also called angiosperms, can be divided into two groups. These groups have differently structured seeds. The groups are called monocotyledons and diocotyledons. Monocotyledons. Monocotyledons make a seed with a seed coat. Inside the seed there is plant embryo with a primitive root and a supply of food for the new plant. The food supply is called the endosperm, and it is all in one piece. When the little plant comes out, the root goes down and a single spire goes up
