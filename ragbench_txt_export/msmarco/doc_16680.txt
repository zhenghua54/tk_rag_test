Nightshades. At the genus level of classification, tomatoes belong in the genus Solanum, also known as the nightshades. Although nightshades include familiar food crops like tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant, the rest of the plant is poisonous. Nightshades primarily grow in tropical regions. Plant Kingdom. Tomatoes belong to the plant kingdom, a broad classification that they share with other species such as moss, ferns and trees. Plants are multi-cellular organisms, and their cells contain a true nucleus, but the most important distinction of the plant kingdom is its ability to produce its own food.
