This goes to the very heart of the liberal/conservative debate  and, as you can imagine, it s not pretty. Our government says that you should cook a whole chicken until the temperature measured in the thigh is 180°F (82°C). If you cook chicken pieces, the government says, the thigh, wings, and drumsticks should be 180°F, while the breast should reach 170°F (77°C). It is also virtually assured that no one would ever eat chicken again. If you cook a whole chicken until the thigh reaches 180 °F, the breast will be around 170°F, and the whole thing will have turned to rubber.
