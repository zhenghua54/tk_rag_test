Opioids are substances that act on the nervous system in a similar way to opiates such as morphine and codeine. In a medical context the term usually indicates medications that are artificially made rather than extracted from opium. The term opioid was first used in the early 1960s. Its basic meaning is opiate-like (opiates being a set of narcotic drugs derived from opium), and many sources do not define it more explicitly than that.
