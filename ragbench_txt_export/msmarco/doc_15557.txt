Structure of the trachea The trachea is lined by cartilage and divided into two branches. These two branches are called the bronchi. The left bronchus enters the left lung and the right bronchus enters the right lung. Each bronchus is further divided into around 25 smaller branches. These smaller divisions of bronchi are known as the bronchioles.
