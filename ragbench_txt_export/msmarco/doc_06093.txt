Opioid like compounds found in natural opium latex are classified as opiates, not opioids. In 2013 between 28 and 38 million people used opioids recreationally (0.6% to 0.8% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). The term opioid was first used in the early 1960s. Its basic meaning is opiate-like (opiates being a set of narcotic drugs derived from opium), and many sources do not define it more explicitly than that.
