Hi, Can you please help and advise me what a rough cost would be for laying foundations for an extension/conservatory - 3.0m x 3.0m. Hire of digger, removal of soil (3 times what you dig out in volume!!), concrete readymix and oversite including DPM, insulation etc cost me approximately Â£1500. I had to dig down and have 1m footings 600mm wide.
