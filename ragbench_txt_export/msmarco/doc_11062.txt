Common Income. The common income is typically high with both degrees, but a finance degree is somewhat better. People with economics degrees will typically make around $70,000 to $115,000 at their peak. If you have a finance degree, then you can expect around $65,000 to $170,000. At the same time, this entirely depends on your position. For example, some less motivated finance degree holders work for years as bank tellers.
