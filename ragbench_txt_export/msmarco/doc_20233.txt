Prices vary across the United States for the installation and lease of an ignition interlock system. You can expect to pay up to $100 for installation and between $50-$100 per month for the lease. This is a rough estimate and your price may be higher or lower depending on your geographic location. An ignition interlock device (IID) is similar to a breathalyzer, however an IID is connected to the vehicle dashboard or other location inside the vehicle and requires that a driver breath into the device prior to starting the vehicle.
