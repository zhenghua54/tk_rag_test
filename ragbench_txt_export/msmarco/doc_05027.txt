At the top of your budget, $350,000 for a 2500 square foot house comes out at $140 per square foot. I have no idea what building costs are in NJ, but I've certainly heard that they are high. Builder 3 - would not give a price per sq foot but stated he just built a 3000 sqft home and total was about 450k but it did not include a lot of upgrades.. Builder 3 actually showed us the plans for the house that he said cost around 450k..
