Dried beans, dried fruits, black-strap molasses, dark green leafy vegetables, prune juice, iron fortified cereals, and lima beans are also good sources of non heme iron. Combine non heme sources of iron with vitamin C for best absorption. Iron is a mineral and an essential part of hemoglobin, the protein substance which enables red blood cells to carry oxygen through the body. Iron is better absorbed when consumed with a vitamin C source.
