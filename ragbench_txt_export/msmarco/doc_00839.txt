Carbohydrates are organic compounds, and chemically they consist of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Carbohydrates are your body's primary source for energy. Carbohydrates includ â€¦ e sugars, starches, and cellulose. Your body must break down carbohydrates in order to turn them into glucose. Starch (in rice, sago, wheat, other grains) is a polysaccharide. When we eat carbohydrates (mainly starch in grains, bread etc.), it is broken down into single molecules of glucose or other monosaccharide. Ultimately as a fuel it reaches into blood as glucose.
