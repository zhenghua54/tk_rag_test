My google research doesn’t give me any reason to doubt the credentials of Avaaz or of Ricken, who appears to be a very genuine guy. To my eye, his comments on this blog do not look like PR. They look like the words of someone doing something he is passionate about. Thanks for this information. I like the reply that Avaaz should organise a petition against spam !!!! I’m sorry guys, but it seems to me that avazz do such good work that your complaining about not getting a personal email & accusing them of being spamers themselves is a bit sad.
