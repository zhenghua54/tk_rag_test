In this case, when lactose is required as a sugar source for the bacterium, the three genes of the lac operon can be expressed and their subsequent proteins translated: lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The gene product of lacZ is Î²-galactosidase which cleaves lactose, a disaccharide, into glucose and galactose. In summary: 1  When lactose is absent then there is very little Lac enzyme production (the operator has Lac repressor bound to it). 2  When lactose is present but a preferred carbon source (like glucose) is also present then a small amount of enzyme is produced (Lac repressor is not bound to the operator).
