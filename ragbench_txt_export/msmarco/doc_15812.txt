Fee Simple. The most common form of ownership, when a homeowner purchases a home, is the fee simple absolute. The holder of a title in fee simple has full possessory rights now and in the future for an infinite duration. There are no limitations on its inheritability. The holder of the estate can sell the entire estate or any part of it and dispose of it by will at time of death.
