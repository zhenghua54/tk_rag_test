Fire resistance testing on structural steel members have shown, that by incorporating a proprietary fire protection system, the ability of the structure to resist fire will be greatly enhanced dependent upon the particular system chosen. It is this “char” that provides the fire protection to the steel work which, in some instances, can be up to 50 times its initial applied thickness. Therefore, secondary casings applied to the steel members must allow for expansion to ensure the intumescent paint system performs correctly. PRINTABLE VERSION.
