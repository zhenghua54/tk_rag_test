Because these arteries supply blood to the cerebellum and to the brain stem, blockages or hemorrhaging there can cause either ataxic (cerebellar) or flaccid (lower motor neuron) dysarthria.. It is important to note that the effects of ischemic stroke are almost always contralateral and therefore unilateral. One exception to this pattern is alternating hemiplegia. This is a paralysis that can be caused by ischemic stroke and affects different structures on each side of the body. It results from a brain stem lesion that damages cranial nerve nuclei and one side of the pyramidal tract in the same area.
