Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper belt is a region between about 30 and 50 AU from the Sun in the plane of the ecliptic. It is believed to be where most of the trans-Neptunian objects are, including Pluto and several other recently discovered dwarf planets. It is also thought to be the origin of many of the solar system's short-period comets. There are several types of Kuiper belt objects, or KBOs. Classical KBOs orbit between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun with most between 42 and 48 AU.
