The termite extermination cost alone can be between $500 to $5,000, which may include the cost of preventative measures to keep out termites in the future. However, the costs may vary according to the method used. For example, the termite fumigation cost for a home that is 1250 square feet can be between $1,000 to $3,000, while a 2500-square foot home can be between $2,500-$4,000.
