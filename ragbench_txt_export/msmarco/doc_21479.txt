In 2004, Tizer aired a campaign depicting a red chameleon remaining the same colour despite a number of different coloured backgrounds-the campaign's slogan was No, we're not changing colour.. The television adverts ended with Ed the Head appearing from the bottle and saying Tizer, it's a red thing. 'Tizer Ice' was launched in the late 1990s. The drink included menthol, giving it the sensation of tasting cold, even at room temperature. Later branded Ice by Tizer, the product did not sell well and was removed from sale.
