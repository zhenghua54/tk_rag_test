Deferred revenue is a liability account found on the company's balance sheet. The balance represents advance payments received from customers for products that will be shipped or services that will be performed in the future. At the end of September, the balance in the deferred revenue account will be $5,500, the total advance payment for the contract minus the services provided in the first month that are now recognized in revenue.
