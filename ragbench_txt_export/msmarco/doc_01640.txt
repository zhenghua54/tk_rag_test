Bottom paint improves ship performance and durability as it reduces the rate of biofouling, which is the growth of organisms on the ship's hull. Although such paints are effective, the TBT slowly leaches out into the marine environment where it is highly toxic to a wide range of organisms. TBT compounds are organotin compounds, with 3 butyl groups covalently bonded to a tin(IV) centre. A general formula for these compounds is (n-C 4 H 9) 3 Sn-X. The X group is typically an electronegative leaving group such as chloride or carboxylate ..
