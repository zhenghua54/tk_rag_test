SQAS (Safety & Quality Assessment System) is a system to evaluate the quality, safety, security and environmental performance of Logistics Service Providers (LSP's) and Chemical Distributors in a uniform manner by single standardised assessments carried out by independent assessors using a standard questionnaire. Cefic has developed five specific SQAS questionnaires for the different types of LSP active in land logistics and one for chemical distribution, in close co-operation with the involved partner companies and their associations.
