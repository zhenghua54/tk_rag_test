Climate. Southeast Asian Rainforests. The tropical rain forest is a forest of tall trees in a region of year-round warmth. An average of 50 to 260 inches (125 to 660 cm.) of rain falls yearly. Many kinds of trees that grow in the mountains of the Amazon rain forest do not grow in the lowlands of that same forest. Layers of the Rainforest There are four very distinct layers of trees in a tropical rain forest. These layers have been identified as the emergent, upper canopy, understory, and forest floor.
