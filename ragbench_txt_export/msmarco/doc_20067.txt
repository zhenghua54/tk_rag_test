The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source. This means that the emitted radiation does not follow the form of a black-body spectrum. These sources are assigned what is known as a correlated color temperature (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to human color perception most closely matches the light from the lamp.
