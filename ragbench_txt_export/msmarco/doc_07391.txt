The largest single cost of installing a new bathroom fan is the price of the fan itself. How much that costs will depend entirely on how elaborate you want to get. You can install a small simple exhaust fan that has no extras and gets the job done to adequately ventilate your bathroom. Or you can install a decorative fan and light combination that matches the decor of your room.
