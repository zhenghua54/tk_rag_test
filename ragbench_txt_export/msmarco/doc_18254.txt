However, it is possible that cold sores heal better when they are kept moist. Of course, aciclovir cream will keep it moist as well as having a specific antiviral action. Tea tree oil, or oil from a vitamin A or vitamin C capsule, are other methods of keeping it moist and may reduce inflammation slightly. Be hygienic. Hygiene is important, because you do not want a bacterial infection to move in. 1  Try not to touch the sore with your hands. 1 If you apply any cream or oil to the sore, use a new cotton-wool bud each time. 2  To wash the area, dab it gently with a moistened tissue. 3  Do not apply any disinfectant, because this may be too harsh for the damaged skin.
