PORK SHOULDER, or PORK BUTT. Starting from the front of the pig: Pork shoulder (also called pork butt or “Boston butt”) is generally sold as a 5 to 10 pound boneless roast at the grocery store. (Pork shoulder chops are sold with bones, but those are less common.). Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in the world and we're always down for a good pork dinner. But there are many cuts to choose from, some better known than others, even just at your neighborhood grocery store.
