Preparing a legal memorandum. A legal memorandum is a highly structured type of writing that follows certain conventions. The structure and conventions are discussed below, and a sample memorandum is included. Because each legal problem is distinct, no two memoranda will be organised in precisely the same way. A legal memorandum is comprised of certain standard elements: 1  the heading. 2  a summary of the relevant facts. 3  succinct identification of the legal issues. 4  a discussion of the law relevant to the legal issues, and application of that law to the facts. 5  a conclusion that is responsive to the legal issues
