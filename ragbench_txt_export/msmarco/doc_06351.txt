EDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient. This includes a variety of technologies, including modem (asynchronous and synchronous), FTP, e-mail, HTTP, AS1, AS2, etc. It is important to differentiate between the EDI documents and the methods for transmitting them. In EDI terminology inbound and outbound refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document.
