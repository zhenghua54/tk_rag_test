The History of the Sport of Rowing. The sport of rowing has been in existence as long as humans have traveled the water by boat. The first reference to rowing as a sport, and not simply as a means of transportation, comes from a fifteenth century BC Egyptian funerary carving. The writer Virgil mentioned rowing as part of the funeral games for Aeneas.
