The average worker with an associate’s degree and little experience makes an annual salary of $37,100 vs. $46,900 for someone with a bachelor’s degree — a 26% difference. But fast-forward down the road a few years when that worker has 10 or more years of experience and the discrepancy between what the average worker with an associate’s degree and bachelor’s degree earns is nearly $30,000 per year — a difference of more than 50%.
