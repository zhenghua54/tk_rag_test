The largest American alligator ever reported was supposedly 19.8 ft (6 m) long, although there are doubts about the claim. Size relative to a 6-ft (2-m) man: The American alligator is a rare success story of an endangered animal not only saved from extinction but now thriving. State and federal protections, habitat preservation efforts, and reduced demand for alligator products have improved the species' wild population to more than one million and growing today.
