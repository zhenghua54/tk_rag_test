Psychomotor tests are used to test candidates who want to train as laparoscopic surgeons. Children may be given a psychomotor test for diagnostic purposes if a developmental delay is suspected. Children must develop a number of psychomotor abilities before they can buckle or tie their own shoes. A range of basic skills are tested during a psychomotor test, from precision, dexterity, coordination and control to reaction times, stability, speed and coherence.
