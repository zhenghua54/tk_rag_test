For around home use, you are wondering how soon can you get onto the next phase of the project-whatever that project may be. It does depend on the project as to whether you will be safe or not. For example, mortar in the bottom of a new shower pan can be worked on within a day. Also depends on where you get the cement from .. something like B&Q isnt very potent and so may take longer. Leave it at least 48 hours before you walk on it. Source(s): Work for the largest concrete companies in the world selling concrete, asphalt and aggregates.
