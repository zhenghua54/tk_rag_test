Foods or supplements containing beta-carotene are converted to vitamin A for the maintenance of healthy skin, good vision, and a robust immune system. Beta-carotene is also a powerful antioxidant, and has been shown to help guard against cancer and heart disease. Foods such as carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, watermelon, apricots, and mangoes are good sources of beta-carotene; romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, and broccoli are also rich in carotenoids (the yellow color is covered up by chlorophyll in green leafy plants).
