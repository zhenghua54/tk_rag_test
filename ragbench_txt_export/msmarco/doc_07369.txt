The standard lodging per diem rate will increase to $83. The meals and incidental expense tiers remain unchanged for FY 2014 and range from $46-$71. GSA identified two new non-standard areas (NSAs): Big Spring, TX (Howard County); and Pearsall, TX (Frio, La Salle, and Medina Counties). The General Services Administration's (GSA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 per diem review has resulted in lodging and meal allowance changes for certain locations within the Continental United States (CONUS) to provide for reimbursement of Federal employees' expenses covered by per diem.
