The lining of the lungs, called the pleura or pleural membranes, consists of thin membranes that cover the lungs and provide protection and support. Some diseases can cause these membranes to thicken, often as a result of inflammation. Pleural thickening is commonly linked to mesothelioma and asbestosis, which are caused by asbestos exposure. The condition can also be caused by other diseases such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.
