Zur Hausen postulated and analyzed a possible role of HPV in cervical cancer development. The first HPV types (HPV16 and 18) were isolated from cancer biopsies of the cervix and were cloned in 1983 and 1984, respectively [1] . Further epidemiological studies have confirmed that cervical infection by high-risk (HR) HPV types is the main risk factor for cervical cancer development. HPV are contributing for 30% of all infection-associated cancers [4] . HPV are present in almost all of cervical cancer cases, with HPV16 and 18 accounting for 70% of cases.
