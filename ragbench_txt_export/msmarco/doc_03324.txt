1 If your gas company charges to install a new gas line and you'd rather hire your own certified plumber or contractor, go ahead and get a quote from the gas company, then make sure the bids from the private companies include the same specifications as the gas company's quote. 1 If not, running a new line from the gas manifold (where the gas service to your house starts) to where you want the new appliance installed might take 20-30 linear feet or more, which works out to $300-$750.
