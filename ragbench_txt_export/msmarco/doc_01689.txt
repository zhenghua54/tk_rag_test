A person with abnormally low levels of blood sugar (glucose) has hypoglycemia. Glucose is the body's main energy source. Hypoglycemia is not a disease in itself; it is a sign of a health problem. The majority of people know when their blood sugar levels have dropped, and have time to do something about it. According to Medilexicon's medical dictionary, hypoglycemia is Symptoms resulting from low blood glucose (normal glucose range 60-100 mg/dL [3.3-5.6 mmol/L]), which are either autonomic or neuroglycopenic. Autonomic symptoms include sweating, trembling, feelings of warmth, anxiety, and nausea.
