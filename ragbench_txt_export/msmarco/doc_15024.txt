For cooler climates, a very broad estimate of furnace sizing is to select one that generates 40 to 45 BTUs per square foot. At 40 to 45 BTUs per square foot, you'd need a 100,000 to 112,500 BTU furnace to heat your 2,500-square-foot home. The heating degree-day calculation for a furnace is 50 x heating therms x furnace efficiency = load in BTUs/hour. Your furnace must produce a certain load, measured in BTUs per hour, to heat your home.
