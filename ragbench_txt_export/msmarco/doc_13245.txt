Unfortunately, it could take forever to get rid of toenail fungus if you wait for it to go away on its own. “Sad fact is, a toenail fungus problem will not usually go away on its own,” says the California Foot and Ankle Doctors. Discovery Health says it can take “a year to a year-and-a-half to grow from cuticle to tip.” As long as your old infected nail is there, you will still have toenail fungus.
