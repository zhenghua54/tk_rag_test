Thus, the average life span of a feral cat that survives beyond kittenhood is about two years for independent cats and five years for cats in a cat colony. In contrast, a cat that lives indoors under proper human care has a life expectancy of 15â€“22 years. Almost all cats that are left to survive outdoors will succumb to starvation, thirst, disease, parasites or predation. Another threat to the life of a feral cat is weather.
