1 With professional installation a rail fence can cost $8-$25 or more a foot, or $900-$3,000 for 100' and $6,800-$21,000 to enclose a square acre, depending on local rates, the number of rails and the terrain (sloping properties or those with difficult access will cost more). 1 For do-it-yourselfers digging fence post holes, a manual post hole digger or auger typically costs $15-$110; buying a small power auger can cost $60-$600 or more depending on size and materials; and a one-day rental of a powered post hole auger can cost $50-$95.
