BACKGROUND: A tissue is a group of cells that have a similar shape and function. Different types of tissues can be found in different organs. In humans, there are four basic types of tissue: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous tissue. There may be various sub-tissues within each of the primary tissues.
