The Song Thrush typically nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. It breeds up to the tree-line, reaching 2,200 metres (7,250 ft) inSwitzerland. Few birds make better use of the structures provided to them for nesting sites than the osprey. Its nest is so large that it requires a sturdy site, so the bird will construct â€¦ nests on telephone poles and platforms along coasts and lakes. The osprey's nest is comprised of vines, sticks, sod and other materials.
