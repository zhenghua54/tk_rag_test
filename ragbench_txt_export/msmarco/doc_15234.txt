ABOUT COELIAC DISEASE. Coeliac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disease where the body’s immune system reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. The body’s reaction to gluten causes damage to the lining of the intestine, preventing the body from absorbing important nutrients. About 500,000 people in the UK are living with undiagnosed coeliac disease without realising it. There are a range of symptoms including constant mouth ulcers, crippling fatigue, stomach pain, regular bouts of diarrhoea, anaemia and weight loss.
