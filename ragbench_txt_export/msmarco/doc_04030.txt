At $120,000 per day for promoted tweets alone, you would have to hope that the investment worked for them. And that’s without the additional cost of running the campaign through Twitter, ads, and the screenings. $5,000 per month on advertising via a relatively new and unproven platform is too much for many small businesses. While the chief of revenue states the minimum ad spend is $15,000 over 3 months, this could change as Twitter has just announced it’s introducing a self-serve ad system by the end of the year.
