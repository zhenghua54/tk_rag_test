Oil, useful products, environmental problems, introduction to organic chemistry. 6. Cracking a problem of supply and demand, other products. Cracking is a thermal decomposition process by which large alkane hydrocarbon molecules are broken down by passing them over a heated catalyst at high pressure. The products are smaller alkanes used for fuels (e.g. petrol or diesel) and alkenes which are used to make polymers plastics and other important compounds. These notes on cracking alkanes to make alkenes for plastics and other products from cracking like petrol and diesel fuels are designed to meet the highest standards of knowledge and understanding required for students/pupils doing GCSE chemistry, IGCSE chemistry, O Level chemistry and KS4 science courses.
