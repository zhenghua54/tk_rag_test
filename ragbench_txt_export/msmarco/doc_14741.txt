1 Grow a top-heavy desert rose in a heavy, clay pot filled with a well-draining cactus soil mixture. 2  Using a pot with a 16-inch or larger diameter and bottom drainage holes allows the plant's stem to swell over time with minimal need for repotting. 3. Water the desert rose when its soil feels almost completely dry when you insert your finger into the soil. Water until moisture begins to drip from the bottom of the pot, indicating the soil is moistened throughout the plant's root zone.
