A deepwater drill ship can run about $250K-500K/ day operating cost (day rate), to an oil company leasing it's services. And that was about 5 years ago. So the annual cost for both operation and maintenance would be around $180 million. These rigs usually last 30-35 years, which works out to a per-day cost of $59k (again, shows up as depreciation). Current day rates for these types of ships are running around $550k/day.
