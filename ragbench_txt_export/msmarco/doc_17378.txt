You can retire as early as age 62, but if you retire before your full retirement age, your benefits will be permanently reduced, based on your age. For example, if you retire at age 62, your benefit would be about 25 percent lower than what it would be if you waited until you reach full retirement age. To draw full retirement benefits, the following Social Security Administration age rules apply: Born in 1937 or earlier-Full retirement can be drawn at age 65. Born in 1938 - Full retirement can be drawn at age 65 years and 2 months. Born in 1939 -- Full retirement can be drawn at age 65 years and 4 months
