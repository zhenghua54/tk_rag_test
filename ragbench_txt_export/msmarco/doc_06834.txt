Joshua has in. Tectonic plates move because they are floating on top of the liquid mantle. The mantle itself moves due to convection currents: hot rock rises, gives off some heat, then falls. This creates vast swirls of moving liquid rock under the crust of the earth, which jostles the plates of crust on top. These large pieces of rocks are called tectonic plates. Tectonic plates never stop moving, this process is called continental drift. Tectonic plates move because of convection currents. These convection currents happen in the mantle, underneath the
