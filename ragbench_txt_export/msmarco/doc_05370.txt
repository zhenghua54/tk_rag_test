The item is not forced upon the player from Pete or other characters, as was in Animal Crossing: City Folk. Since the Japanese release of Animal Crossing: New Leaf on 28th November 2012, several downloadable or distributed items were available for players in Japan. A few of these items were eventually released in North America and Europe, but many remain Japan only items.
