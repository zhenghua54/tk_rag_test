You can generate a smooth, professional-looking finish on a plastic surface by spray painting. Before you rush into the paint application process, understand an important point -- nonporous plastic will reject new finishes unless you abrade it prior to painting. Coat the abraded plastic with acrylic spray primer. Spray in a sweeping, side-to-side motion. Maintain a distance of 8 inches between the plastic and the spray nozzle as you apply. Wait three hours for the primer to dry.
