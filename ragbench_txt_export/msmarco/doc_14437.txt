A HealthyWomen answered. During pregnancy, you should see your doctor or midwife every four to five weeks until 28 weeks, every two to three weeks from 28 to 36 weeks, and then weekly until you're ready to deliver. Ideally, you should have a pre-conceptual visit with your provider to make sure you are in optimal health before becoming pregnant. But don't worry if you discover you are pregnant before having a chance to meet with your doctor or midwife; these conversations and tests will occur during your first prenatal visit.
