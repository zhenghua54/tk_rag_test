All seedless watermelons are hybrids and take the longest time to mature. The seeds germinate between seven and 14 days and they must be kept between 75 and 85 degrees. It's also necessary to plant seedless watermelons next to seeded watermelons, as the hybrid varieties need a pollinator. For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees. Position the seeds no more than 5 feet away from each other, so the seedlings have room to mature into large fruit.
