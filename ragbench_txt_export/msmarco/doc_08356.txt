Pregnancy and Late-Onset Menopause. While it is still rare, women are giving birth in their early 50s more than ever before. This can delay menopause, as a woman’s body adjusts to the hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy. While it is rare for a woman over 50 to conceive and not miscarry, any pregnancy at all has an impact on the woman’s hormonal level. When a woman’s ovaries produce these hormones longer, osteoporosis and heart problems seem to also be delayed. Because of this, women with late-onset menopause actually tend to live longer.
