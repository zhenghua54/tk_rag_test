Some thousands of families today in the English-speaking world bear the surname of Bewley. A number of these families can trace their origins back to Thomas de Beaulieu, who lived in the 14th century in Thistlethwaite, Cumberland, England. The story of the family has been told by one of his distinguished descendants, Sir Edmund Thomas Bewley (1837-1908) Q.C., J.P., of Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, Ireland, in his book The Bewleys of Cumberland, published in 1904 (Download Bewleys of Cumberland).
