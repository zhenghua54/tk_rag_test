A slightly harder, real life example: The average height for grown men in the United States is 70, with a standard deviation of 3. A standard deviation of 3” means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height 3 taller to 3” shorter than the average (67–73) — one standard deviation. If the standard deviation were 20, then some men would be much taller or much shorter than the average, with a typical range of about 50–90. For another example, each of the three groups {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has an average (mean) of 7. But their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1.
