It is not cheap, though. Expect around $100+ for a neuter and $200+ for a spay, they need to use a different anesthesia for rabbits than with dogs and cats, make sure you use a rabbit knowledgeable vet. Rabbits can make good pets for some people, as long as you have realistic expectations. Rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age, so keep them separate until spayed & neutered. Female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85%, so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life.
