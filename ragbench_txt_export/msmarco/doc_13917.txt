1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 2. Season your pork chops. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, dried oregano, and any other spices you like. 1  If you want to make breaded pork chops, mix up 1 cup of flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. 2  In a separate dish, mix 1 egg and 2 tablespoons water. 2. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet. Place the skillet over medium high heat and let the oil get nice and hot. 1  Any type of oil will do-olive oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil-you pick. 2  You could also use butter. 3  If you're frying more than 4 or so pork chops, you might need to heat up a second pan as well.
