Although the aquiline nose is found among people from nearly every area of the world, it is generally associated with and thought to be more frequent in certain ethnic groups originating from Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and South Asia. The flat, broad nose is ubiquitous among most populations in Africa, and is noted by nineteenth-century writers and travelers (such as Colin Mackenzie) as a mark of  Negroid  ancestry. It stands in opposition to the narrow aquiline, straight or convex noses (lepthorrine), which are instead deemed  Caucasian .
