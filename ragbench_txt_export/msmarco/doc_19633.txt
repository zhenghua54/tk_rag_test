Show day for both the German and Japanese Spitz, brush up using a dilution of Plush Puppy OMG Grooming Spray the concentrate version diluted 30:1 i.e. 30 parts water to one part OMG. You can dilute as much as 40:1. Brush through using Plush Puppy Pin Brush either regular pins or long pins. Wrong! If you are to show this breed and the Japanese Spitz each week, you need to have a full coat not one halfway there and the quickest and best way is to get that dead hair out and fast! No amount of brushing will remove it fully or as well as my routine I use. That is to bath, oil and blow dry.
