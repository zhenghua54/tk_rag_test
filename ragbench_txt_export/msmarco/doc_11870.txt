When collagen is collected into fibers, called fibrils, it is found in the skin, ligaments and tendons, corneas, cartilage and bone, blood vessels and even the gut. It also constitutes 1-2% of your muscle. Amazingly, collagen makes up nearly 35% of your entire body’s protein content! Of course, what we’re really interested in here is what collagen does to maintain the skin’s integrity. Along with keratin, a protein most often associated with hair and skin, and elastin, collagen maintains elasticity and strength. It also “plumps out” the skin, making lines appear more shallow.
