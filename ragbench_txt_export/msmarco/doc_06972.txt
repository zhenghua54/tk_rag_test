Much of Nygrenâ€™s business involves creating custom shower and/or tub spaces along with complete bathroom remodels. By his estimate, a typical job that includes replacing an old shower or tub with a custom shower pan, new wall tile, a glass surround and a custom glass door ranges in cost from about $4,000 to $5,000. Without the custom door, the price drops about $1,000.
