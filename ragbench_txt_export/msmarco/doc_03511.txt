Xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD agar) is a selective growth medium, which is used for isolation of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. from clinical samples and from food. The pH of XLD agar is 7.4 and it contains the pH indicator methyl red, which gives a red or pink colour. The other half (B) is covered with E. coli-agar. Most pathogens of the urinary tract grow on CLED agar and if they are lactose fermenting, the colour of CLED agar changes from green to yellow. The MacConkey agar is used to grow mainly gram negative bacteria.
