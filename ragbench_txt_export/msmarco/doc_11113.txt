Baby back ribs of the pork variety are enormously popular, and therefore they fetch a nice price for retailers. Looking at the wholesale prices for this week (this price is lower than what you pay at the store), pork baby back ribs are selling for $2.38 per pound and boneless pork loin is just $1.33. When the meat is still on the hog, the baby backs and the loin are attached.
