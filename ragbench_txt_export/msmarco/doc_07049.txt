Prepare the grill to cook the ham. Cooking a fresh ham on the grill requires indirect heat to ensure it cooks through. This means the ham will not sit directly over the heat source. Place a drip pan under the grate where the fresh ham will sit. For a charcoal grill, fill a charcoal chimney with briquettes and ignite. When the charcoal is ready, move it to one side of the grill. For a gas grill, light one side and leave the side under the fresh ham unlit. Pre-heat the grill as you would an oven. Step 5. Place the ham on the grill over the drip pan with its fatty side facing up. Lower the grill cover, with the bottom vents fully open and the side vents open about one-quarter. Add more charcoal every 30 minutes or so for even cooking.
