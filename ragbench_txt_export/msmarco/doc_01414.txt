Two types of spur exists namely the inferior calcaneal spur which develops on the inferior part of calcaneus in response to plantar fasciitis and posterior calcaneal spur which is seen on the back portion of the heel at Achilles tendon. It is located on the heel bone and it develops due to repeated deposits of calcium on the bone spur (osteophyte) of the heels. Generally it does not cause any problem to the person, but when the calcium deposits exceed certain level, it can cause complications.
