Definition. The process whereby something or someone is pushed to the edge of a group and accorded lesser importance. This is predominantly a social phenomenon by which a minority or sub-group is excluded, and their needs or desires ignored. The marginalization of black people as a whole went on unopposed throughout much of the twentieth century, fortunately things are improving.
