Just remember that being a landlord is not all fun and games. You’ll work hard for your money and may be faced with adversity from time to time. Buying rental property is not for everyone. It should be an investment option you consider only once you’ve achieved a certain level of financial independence. Ask yourself if you’re comfortable confronting your tenants before you start renting. Keep in mind that you’ll have to make judgment calls as a landlord. For example, imagine you’ve had a tenant for six months and one month he doesn’t pay the rent. You don’t hear from him for a week.
