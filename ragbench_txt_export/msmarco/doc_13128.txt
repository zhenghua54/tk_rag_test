Doctorate. The highest level of nursing degree that you can earn is a doctor of nursing practice, or DNP. You need to have a bachelor’s degree at least to enter a DNP program. You also usually already have your MSN in this program, but there are some DNP programs that allow you to earn your MSN and DNP at the same time. You will qualify for 88% or more of the available nursing jobs if you have your BSN; that falls to only 37% with an associate’s degree. This is a four year degree that combines learning in the classroom with clinical training.
