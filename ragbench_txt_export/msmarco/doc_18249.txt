The new policy of CNET Download.com concerning the downloads coming from their site, involves a certain download and a possible installation of unwanted software which comes with their new installer. I see that pastywhitegurl was a victim of their new policy. All products on CNET Download.com now have a direct download link. However only CNET Installer Enabled products call it out separately with a Direct Download Link located underneath the green Download Now button. Bravo CNET.
