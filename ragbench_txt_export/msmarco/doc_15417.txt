TEM micrograph of a B. subtilis bacterium, with the hair-like glycocalyx visible surrounding the cell membrane (scale bar = 200 nm). The glycocalyx is a glycoprotein-polysaccharide covering that surrounds the cell membranes of some bacteria, epithelia and other cells. Most animal epithelial cells have a fuzz-like coat on the external surface of their plasma membranes. The glycocalyx exists in bacteria as either a capsule or a slime layer. 6 points at the glycocalyx. The difference between a capsule and a slime layer is that in a capsule polysaccharides are firmly attached to the cell wall, while in a slime layer the glycoproteins are loosely attached to the cell wall.
