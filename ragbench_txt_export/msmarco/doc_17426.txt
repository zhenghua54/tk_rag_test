It was first used in the 1940's, and was invented by Alfred Coggins, a veternarian who worked at Cornell University in Ithica, New York. In a coggins test they draw some blood to test for EIA. It is required at basically every recognized show, in many states to transport, and most barns will require you present it. Around here it costs $20-$40, but I would assume that varies by region.
