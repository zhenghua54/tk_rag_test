Milonguero-style tango is typically danced with a slightly leaning posture that typically joins the torsos of the two dancers from the tummy through the solar plexus (in an embrace that some Argentines call apilado) to create a merged axis while allowing a little bit of distance between the couple's feet. To the extent that orillero-style tango is still danced it has become more like the Villa Urquiza style of tango. It is danced with upright body posture with the dancers maintaining separate axes, and the embrace is typically offset in a V and can be either close or open.
