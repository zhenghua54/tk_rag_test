Reply. Think about it: all sales are cash to the bank or owner of the property. The only difference is the amount of time for closing. If a home as been on the market more than a month or so, it is not a big deal for the banks to wait a few more weeks for a good offer (as they perceive it). Cash is king only if the sale has a bona fide time constraint and must be completed by a date certain. Oneal Gordon, Home Buyer, Fort Lauderdale, FL. Its not a clear answer but the time to respond depends on the bank and their foreclosure/short sale departments procedure for handling foreclosures. e.g bank of america may take forever. Ive closed a short sale with Chase in under 60 days.
