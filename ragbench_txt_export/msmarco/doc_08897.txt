However, using a patient lift is a safety measure that improves both caregiver and patient safety by preventing patient falls and protecting the caregiver from strain injuries due to heavy lifting. A patient lift also reduces the number of people needed to make a bed to chair transfer. Use of this mobility device becomes even more important when the patient weighs 300 pounds or more, and a bariatric lift will be needed to properly support the patientâ€™s weight. When a person being cared for loses their mobility and can no longer get out of bed, up from a chair or to the commode, these patient lifts make transfers from one spot to another much easier and more comfortable for both caregiver and the person for whom they care.
