Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with self-government than with parliamentary accountability; hence the notion that Newfoundland gave up responsible government when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933.
