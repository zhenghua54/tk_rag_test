Well it turns out that the Roquito chilli are a variety of Jalapeno that has been ripened to red (That is from the Roquito facebook page). Ingredients: Water, Roquito Chilli Pepper (25%)[Chilli Pepper, Water, Sugar, Vinegar], Cider Vinegar. I would be good to know a little more about the Roquito Chilli Pepper. I can find very little information on the Leathams and other web sites, it could just be a brand name that covers any number of chilli varieties, hopefully some one will let me know.
