The Pacific razor clam, Siliqua patula, is a species of large edible marine bivalve mollusc in the family Pharidae. Pacific razor clams are highly desirable and edible, collected both commercially and by recreational harvesters. Razor clams, like other shellfish, may sometimes accumulate dangerous levels of domoic acid, a marine toxin.
