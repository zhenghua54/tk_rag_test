If a package is available on your Red Hat Linux or Fedora Core CDROM, there's an Add/Remove Applications application that is useful. It is invoked via, Add/Remove Applications. It will ask you for the root password, and once that is provided, it will display all applications that may be installed. If you want to install a downloaded RPM or DEB file manually, it can be performed like, # rpm-ivh xargs.rpm. or. # dpkg-i xargs.deb. And if you're manually upgrading a package, use, # rpm-Uvh xargs.rpm. The above command will upgrade the package if it is already installed or install it if it is not.
