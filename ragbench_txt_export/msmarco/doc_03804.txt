Report Abuse. It's an accounting term that means that your creditor wrote the debt off as noncollectable. It does not mean that they can no longer try to collect, they can. A charge off is a disaster for your credit rating and when it occurs, there's no undoing the damage. A charge off stays on your credit report for 7 years from the original date of default, even if you pay the debt back in full.
