By its very definition, broadband is a high speed Internet connection which is also always on. Dial-up access, on the other hand, requires a modem to initiate a 56 Kbps connection to the Internet. The FCC raised the minimum speed of broadband to 4 Mbps downstream, and 1 Mbps upstream. Broadband speed is measured in megabits per second, commonly stated as Mb or Mbps (i.e. 15Mb or 15 Mbps). The smallest unit of digital data is a bit. A byte is equal to 8 bits, and a thousand bytes is a Kilobyte
