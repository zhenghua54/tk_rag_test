Welcome to the Language Varieties Web Site!! This site is about varieties of language that differ from the standard variety that is normally used in the media and taught in the schools. These include pidgins, creoles, regional dialects, minority dialects and indigenized varieties. People don't think one way is right and one way is wrong-just that they're different. It's the same with the language varieties described in this site. * * * * * * Click on any of the locations on the map below to find out more about a language variety spoken there.
