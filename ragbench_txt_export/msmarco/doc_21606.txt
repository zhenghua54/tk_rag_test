Pre-purchase marine surveys on a used boat is usually FREE ! Pre-purchase marine surveys on a new boat is sometimes FREE ! Any decent marine surveyor will almost always find enough deficiencies on a used boat to more than cover the cost of the survey if you choose to negotiate those deficiencies into the price..... I believe my fees are commensurate with other truly qualified and Accredited Marine Surveyors in Ontario but there are non-accredited surveyors who will work for $8 or $9.00 per foot and I am sure they are worth every penny.
