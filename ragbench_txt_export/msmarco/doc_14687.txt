OptiMSM is the one product I can guarantee will pass the purity test every time. When you have the purest form of sulfur on the market today, you will find the benefits allow you to live a cleaner, better life. You are in control of your future, and MSM is there to help every step of the way. As we age our sulfur levels fall but the need rises. MSM is the only pure sulfur product you will find on the market today. But not every manufacturer of MSM provides a pure form of sulfur you need. Instead, those companies can and do cut corners to give you MSM but they give you little surprises. When you head to the local vitamin store or supplement store, you may find oodles of MSM products. You may find that they state they are 99% or even 100% pure. The problem is that the purity is not regulated by the FDA
