Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body. Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure the iron levels in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes). 1 High levels of ferritin can indicate an iron storage disorder, such as hemochromatosis, or a chronic disease process. 2  Low levels of ferritin are indicative of iron deficiency, which causes anemia (a reduction in the number of red blood cells).
