There are two basic types of body cavity searches: visual and manual. A visual search is where the inspecting officer visually looks at bodily areas where contraband can be hidden, such as behind the ears, in between bodily crevices, or in other such areas. Body cavity searches are very serious matters and should be conducted according to the specified procedures. Violations of a body cavity search requirement can affect the outcome of a criminal trial. You may wish to hire a lawyer if you need assistance with search laws in your area.
