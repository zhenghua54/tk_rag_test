Corn syrup is a mildly sweet syrup derived from corn starch. Its main function in recipes is to provide sweetness and moisture, and to prevent the crystallization of sugar. It provides a smooth texture to cooked sweets, such as candies, as well as no-bake recipes, such as ice cream. Karo light and dark corn syrups perform similarly in recipes and can usually be used interchangeably. Recipes usually specify which type to use but the choice may be guided by personal preference. Typically, light corn syrup is used when a delicately sweet flavor is desired, such as in fruit sauces and jams.
