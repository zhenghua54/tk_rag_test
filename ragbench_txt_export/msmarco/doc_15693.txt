Lilies (Lilium spp.) of all kinds, including hybrids, are highly toxic to cats if ingested. Depending on the species, lilies flourish in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 2 through 9; you can also grow them indoors as houseplants. Other lilies like calla lilies (Zantedeschia aethiopica) and peace lilies (Spathiphyllum spp.), which are not in the Lilium genus, are considered toxic to cats, according to the ASPCA.
