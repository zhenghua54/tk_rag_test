It depends. If you add something simple like a bedroom or family room the cost will be $100 to $150 per sq foot. If the add-on includes a bathroom, it will be much more. It also depends on your existing home. On the low end if this 500 sqft will be a 2 car garage then possibly you can build it for $100 a square foot..depending on who you hire, how much work you do yourself. if this new space will be a big kitchen and family room then it could easily cost $200k or even $300k depending on your taste.
