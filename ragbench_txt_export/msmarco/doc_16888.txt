Symptoms of schizophrenia may actually start earlier than age 16. The problem is that behaviors such as irritability and sleep problems may be symptoms of the disease or may be normal teenage behaviors. As more research is done, experts should know more about when the symptoms of this lifelong disease begin. The more well-known symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, typically start when a man is around 16 to 19 years old or in his early 20s. A woman with schizophrenia more typically experiences hallucinations or delusions when she is in her mid-20s or early 30s.
