To get started using an old iPhone as an iPod Touch, insert a SIM card into the phone â€” be sure the card is from the same wireless carrier that the phone uses. Connect the iPhone to an Internet-enabled computer with iTunes. The program will activate the iPhone, letting you use it as an iPod Touch. If the SIM card used in the above activation is still active, you can remove it from the now iPod Touch and place it back in the device that will continue to be used as an iPhone.
