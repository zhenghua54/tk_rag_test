Types of single gene disorders. The occurrence of a disease caused by a single gene mutation may occur in several main patterns or modes. These are grouped according to whether the trait is sex specific (generally X-linked) or not (autosomal). As a rule, single gene disorders (also known as Mendelian traits or diseases) are relatively uncommon.
