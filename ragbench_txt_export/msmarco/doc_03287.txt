Acupuncture is a form of Chinese medicine that has been practiced for centuries. It's based on the theory that energy, called chi (say chee), flows through and around your body along pathways called meridians. Acupuncturists believe that illness occurs when something blocks or unbalances your chi. Acupuncture is a way to unblock or influence chi and help it flow back into balance. Acupuncture is done by putting very thin needles into your skin at certain points on your body. This is done to influence the energy flow.
