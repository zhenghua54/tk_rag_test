This poem The Tide Rises, the Tide Falls means literally that a man is going to a town far far away, but as he is going to the town he grows older and older and older and he walks past a beach and walks across the beach and he walks and walks and dies. When the tide rises and washes away his footprints it means that all his steps in life are over and there is nothing more to do. And when it says that the hostler will take the horse away it means all that you have worked for is gone and you will never see your ambitions fulfilled.
