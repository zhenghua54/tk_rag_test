On Mark's carbohydrate curve, it states that 0g-50g would put you in ketosis/fat burning but it really depends on the individual. 20g sounds good to me-- I usually do about 10g-30g myself per day. As the title suggests, I would like to know how many carbs one would heave to eat to get into ketosis. I've been getting around 20, almost exclusively from eggs, bacon, almonds, and a bit of lemon on my chicken.
