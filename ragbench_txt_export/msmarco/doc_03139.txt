In vector calculus, divergence is a vector operator that measures the magnitude of a vector field 's source or sink at a given point, in terms of a signed scalar. More rigorously, the divergence of a vector field F at a point p is defined as the limit of the net flow of F across the smooth boundary of a three-dimensional region V divided by the volume of V as V shrinks to p. Formally,
