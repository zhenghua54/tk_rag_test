The mesosphere (/ˈmɛsoʊsfɪər/ ; from Greek mesos middle and sphaira ball) is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that is directly above the stratopause and directly below the mesopause. In the mesosphere temperature decreases as the altitude increases. The upper boundary of the mesosphere is the mesopause, which can be the coldest naturally occurring place on Earth with temperatures below 130 K (−226 °F; −143 °C). Within the mesosphere, temperature decreases with increasing height. This is due to decreasing solar heating and increasing cooling by CO 2 radiative emission. The top of the mesosphere, called the mesopause, is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere.
