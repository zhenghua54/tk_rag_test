Comprehensive Auto Insurance now covers all type of incidents that may cause damage to an insured vehicle which include, but are not limited to, theft, fire, vandalism, weather, falling objects and animal damage. Not all causes of damages are covered by a Comprehensive Auto Insurance. There are also certain exclusions that would apply which include damage to the normal wear and tear, vehicle defects and other collision damages which are not included in the comprehensive coverage definition. Comprehensive Auto Insurance is not compulsory. Comprehensive Auto Insurance is an innovation introduced by insurers to their product due to the demand of expansion of the coverage of auto insurance which, before the change, was only limited to vehicle collision.
