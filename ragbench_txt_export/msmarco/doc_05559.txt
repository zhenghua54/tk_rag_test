There seems to be less risk of dry socket during this time. After a wisdom tooth is removed, you may have or notice: 1  Pain and swelling in your gums and tooth socket where the tooth was removed. 2  Bleeding that won't stop for about 24 hours. 3  Difficulty with or pain from opening your jaw (trismus). Before removing a wisdom tooth, your dentist will give you a local anesthetic to numb the area where the tooth will be removed. A general anesthetic may be used, especially if several or all of your wisdom teeth will be removed at the same time.
