AAWRWB The actual Hajj days are only 6 days but with the majority of Hajj tours you will be in Saudi for around 2-3 weeks. Once you have decided on which operator you travel with, you will you have your exact travel dates. As an example this was my itinerary for Hajj 2009..... Assalamalikum hope you are al ok inshallah, just wanted to ask how long hajj will last so that I can inshalalh book the correct tiem of work. Jazakallah khairun. Have Sabr as this life is a big test...it is a prision for the believer and paradise for the unbelievers.....
