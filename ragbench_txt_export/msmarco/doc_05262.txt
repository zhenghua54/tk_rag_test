Modern genetic technology can be used to modify the genomes of living organisms. This process is also known as “genetic engineering.” Genes of one species can be modified, or genes can be transplanted from one species to another. Genetic engineering is made possible by recombinant DNA technology. Organisms that have altered genomes are known as transgenic. Most transgenic organisms are generated in the laboratory for research purposes. For example, “knock-out” mice are transgenic mice that have a particular gene of interest disabled
