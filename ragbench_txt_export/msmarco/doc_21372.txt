Heroin is a semi-synthetic opioid, derived from morphine, that is illegal in the United States and highly addictive. It is used as both a painkiller and a recreational drug for its euphoric, “body-high” effects and has an extremely high potential for abuse. Codeine: Codeine is a natural opiate, though it can also be synthesized from morphine. It is less potent than morphine, and like all opioids has the potential for physical and psychological addiction, though milder than morphine or heroin. It is prescribed to treat cough, diarrhea and pain.
