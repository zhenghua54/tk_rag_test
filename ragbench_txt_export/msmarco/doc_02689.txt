The federal Medicare program has changed the lives of millions of Americans. But the roots of Medicare go back to our nation's early efforts to achieve health coverage for its elderly and poor citizens. It's hard to believe, but the gradual evolution of the plans Humana offers today began more than a hundred years ago. Humana is a Medicare Advantage organization and a stand-alone prescription drug plan with a Medicare contract. Enrollment in this Humana plan depends on contract renewal.
