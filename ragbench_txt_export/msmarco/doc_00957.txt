The most common type of flexible spending account, the medical expense FSA (also medical FSA or health FSA), is similar to a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA). If married, both spouses must earn income for the Dependent Care FSA to work. The only exceptions are if the non-earning spouse is disabled or a full-time student. If one spouse earns less than $5,000 then the benefit is limited to whatever that spouse earned. See IRS Form 2441 Part III for details.
