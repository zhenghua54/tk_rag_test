Is it permissible to have different selection criteria for different categories under the DPS? Yes; where a dynamic purchasing system is divided into categories, the contracting authority should apply selection criteria that are proportionate and relevant to the characteristics of the category concerned. It is to be run as a completely electronic process, and should be set up using the restricted procedure and some other conditions (as set out in Regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015). Contracting authorities, including central purchasing bodies, may set up a DPS.
