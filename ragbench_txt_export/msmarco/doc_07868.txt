Vasuki (Sanskrit: वासुकी, वासव) is a naga, and a nagaraja, one of the King serpents of Hindu and Buddhist mythology. He is a great king of the nagas and has a gem (Nagamani) on his head. Manasa, another naga, is his sister. Vasuki is Shiva's (The destroyer) Snake. Vasuki is also mentioned and used as a tightening rope in other Hindu scriptures, such as in each of the Itihasas (Ramayana and Mahabharata). In Buddhist mythology, Vasuki and the other Naga Kings appear in the audience for many of the Buddha 's sermons.
