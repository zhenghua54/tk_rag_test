1 The cell walls of bacteria are mainly made up of polysaccharides (types of carbohydrate). 2  Cellulose (a type of carbohydrate) makes up most of plant cell walls. 3  Carbohydrates are linked to many proteins and lipids (fats), where they are vitally involved in cell interactions. Saccharides, or carbohydrates, are sugars or starches. Saccharides consist of two basic compounds: aldehydes (composed of double-bonded carbon and oxygen atoms, plus a hydrogen atom), and keytones (composed of double-bonded carbon and oxygen atoms, plus two additional carbon atoms).
