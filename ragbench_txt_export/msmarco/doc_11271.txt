The Greeks designed their coins with pictures of their gods and goddesses. But the Greeks were the first civilization to use pictures of real people on their coins. The first was Alexander the Great, back around 325 BCE. Ancient Greece: 2,500 years ago, each Greek city-state had developed its own coinage. Each Greek city-state had banks where visiting traders could exchange their coins for Greek coins, coins they would then use to buy and sell in the great Greek marketplaces.
