Mistakes are an inevitable part of this process and neither the teacher nor the student should become fixated on them. It is useful for both, however, to have an understanding of the variety of typical errors in written English, since these are the most amenable to correction. Written errors can be categorized as errors of mechanics, grammar and usage. Usage mistakes A usage mistake is a word or a string of words in a sentence that is grammatically possible*, but not usual in standard English. Hence native speakers rarely make usage mistakes, but ESL students very often do.
