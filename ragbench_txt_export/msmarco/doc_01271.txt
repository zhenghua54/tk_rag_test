When someone is in love I think is when the person who sees the girl or guy first, they'll do anything to get their attention or if the one she or he likes wouldn't care how the other person is .Like his attitude or the way they are, specially what others think about the one she or he loves. When you know that someone is in love, is when they day dream. They also drop there grades because they pay more attention to some one else in stead of there work. They also stare at the person they like. Or sometimes they miss a lesson for going to sleep during class.
