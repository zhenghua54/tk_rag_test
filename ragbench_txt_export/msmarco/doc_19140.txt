Mount Fuji is one of Japan's Three Holy Mountains (三霊山, Sanreizan) along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is also a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. Today, Mount Fuji is an international destination for tourism and mountain climbing. In the early 20th century, populist educator Frederick Starr 's Chautauqua lectures about his several ascents of Mount Fuji—1913, 1919, and 1923—were widely known in America.
