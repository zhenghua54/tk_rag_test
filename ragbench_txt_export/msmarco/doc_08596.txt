By the numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American worker got paid $24.57 per hour in December, or $850.12 per week. That was up from $24.17 per hour and $829.03 per week a year ago. However, average income can be misleading given that wages differ significantly from industry to industry. For example, utilities employees were the best paid workers in December, earning an average $35.86 per hour, or $1,509.71 per week.
