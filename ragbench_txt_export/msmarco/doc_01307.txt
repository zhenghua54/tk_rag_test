Tip: If you want to save only part of a PDF file as a Word document, select the part you want to save and then right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS), choose Export Selection As, and then choose Word Document from the Save As Type or Format menu. 3. Specify settings, and then save the file. When you save complex PDF documents, the conversion to Word may take longer. 4. Evaluate the document in Word. Open the saved document in Microsoft Word, and scroll through it to confirm that text and images have been converted appropriately.
