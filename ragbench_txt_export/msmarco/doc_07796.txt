If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with self-government than with parliamentary accountability; hence the notion that Newfoundland gave up responsible government when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933.
