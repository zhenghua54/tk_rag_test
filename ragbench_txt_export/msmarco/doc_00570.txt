In addition to being safer and more efficient, lye is also easier to obtain than strong acids. You can purchase 8 pounds of it —enough to dissolve a few bodies—from soap-making or farm-supply stores for less than $15. If you can't wait for delivery, pick up some drain cleaner from the supermarket, but it's so dilute that you may need to use quite a few bottles.
