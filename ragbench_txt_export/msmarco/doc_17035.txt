When a motor neuron stimulates a muscle fiber, overlapping thick and thin filaments slide along one another and sarcomeres shorten. The combined shortening of many sarcomeres in many muscle fibers results in contraction of the whole muscle. Thick Filaments and its purpose. Thick filaments in a muscle fiber are made of many molecules of the protein myosin. Each myosin molecule has a fibrous tail region and a globular head. For clarity, only one head is shown here. Thin filaments are twisted chains made of the globular protein actin.
