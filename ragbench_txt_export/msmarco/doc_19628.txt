Seeing bugs in your home can conjure up images of disease and filth, especially when you see a large number of them. The tiny black bugs that emerge from your bathtub and sink drains are commonly known as drain flies, although some call them drain moths, filter flies and sewer flies. Although drain flies generally do not transmit disease, you will want to remove them from your home permanently in case they do.
