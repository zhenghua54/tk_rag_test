1. If paint spatter don't come off with soap and water, but can be scratched off with a fingernail, try spraying brake cleaner on a clean piece of cotton rag and another to wipe cleaner off car. Rub 'cleaner' rag over small sections at a time until removed. Wipe off cleaner. 1 After you wipe the paint, check the rag to see if you can detect any paint residue. 2  While you’re at it, make sure the residue isn't the color of your car’s paint. 3  If your car windows also got tagged with spray paint, acetone and a razor blade should clear it up easily.
