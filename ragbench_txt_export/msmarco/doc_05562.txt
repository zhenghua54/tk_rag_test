Sorry, something has gone wrong. Best Answer: I only got two wisdom teeth on the bottom, and they were both impacted. It didnt hurt getting them out and I had no swelling or pain at all. The worst part is that if theyre impacted or have funky roots, they have to cut them out bit by bit. The sound of the saw is scary, and the feel of someone tugging at your teeth is the worst.
