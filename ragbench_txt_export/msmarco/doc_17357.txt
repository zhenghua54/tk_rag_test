If you’re single and not completely loving that fact, there are a few Facebook guidelines to follow to if you want to remain dateable in the eyes of other singles in your social network. Ten things to never post on Facebook if you are single: 1. What you’re looking for in a date. eHarmony should host your dating profile, not your Facebook page. 2. A play-by-play of the dates you do go on. If you chronicle the details of your personal life, no one will want to become part of it.
