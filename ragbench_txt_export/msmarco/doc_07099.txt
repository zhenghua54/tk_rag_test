The majority (70%) of sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. It is reabsorbed into the cytosol of the epithelial cells either alone by diffusion through ion channels followed by water and chloride or together with another product such as glucose or AA using a co-transporter by secondary active co-transport. Epithelial Transport. Sodium is the most important ion in relation to reabsorption from the proximal tubule. Water and chloride follow sodium passively and many other ions, compounds and molecules are absorbed through co-transporters with sodium.
