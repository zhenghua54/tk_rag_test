Annual IRA Contribution Limit. If you’re eligible, you can contribute up to $5,500 in 2014 and 2015, and if you’re age 50 or older, you can contribute up to $6,500 for each year. You can make both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA contribution in the same year, but the total amount cannot exceed the annual limit. With a Traditional IRA, you may be able to deduct your contributions on your taxes, which can help lower your tax bill. Your eligibility to deduct is based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and whether you or your spouse participates in a retirement plan at work.
