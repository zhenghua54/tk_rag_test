Hybrid animals may sound like science fiction, but they're not. Hybrids are typically the topic of my own secret dreams. Said dreams usually revolve around owning a gorilladillo (a cross between a gorilla and an armadillo). Apparently, I might be closer to achieving that goal than I thought. You wouldn't think that the animals below are real, but there are many living examples of such creatures. Unfortunately, most (not all) hybrids end up being sterile so they cannot be bred even further. That doesn't mean we can't clone an army of Ligers, though!
