The walls of the ventral body cavity and outer covering of its organs contain a thin covering called the serosa (also called serous membrane). It is a double-layered membrane made up of two parts called the “ parietal serosa ” (lines the cavity walls) and “ visceral serosa ” (covers organs in the cavity). The serous membranes are separated by a thin layer of fluid called “ serous fluid “.
