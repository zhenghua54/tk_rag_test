No matter how much your gas installation costs, cooking and heating with gas will save you money over time. Where natural gas is available, switching from an electric oven and cooktop to gas can save up to $300 per year. If you need a gas fitter to install, replace or repair an appliance after gas has been installed in your home, you will probably be charged an hourly rate. Gas fitters typically charge $50 to $90 per hour and may charge a call-out fee of up to $100 even for small jobs.
