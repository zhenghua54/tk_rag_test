Glycocalyx: The glycocalyx, an extracellular polymer that surrounds the outside of the cell, is called the capsule when firmly attached; when loosely attached, itâ€™s called a slime layer. The capsule protects bacteria from being phagocytosed (taken up) by immune cells. Here is a list of structures important to prokaryotic cells. Nucleoid: The nucleoid is the region in the cell where the tangled mass of genetic material, called the chromosome, is found. Unlike the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, the nucleoid does not have a membrane.
