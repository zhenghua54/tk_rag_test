SweeTneSS The primary functions of sugar in food products are to provide sweetness and energy. Our sense of taste can identify four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The first taste that we encounter (breast milk) is sweet, which may be why a sweet taste is appreciated and interpreted positively. For example, a small amount of added sugar can enhance the taste of nutritious, but sour or bitter foods. Sugarâ€™s aroma enhancing properties are used in a wide range of foods, such as bread and fruit products.
