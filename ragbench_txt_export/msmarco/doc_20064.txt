The color temperature of a light source is a numerical measurement of its color appearance. It is based on the principle that any object will emit light if it is heated to a high enough temperature and that, as the temperature increases, the color of that light will change along with the temperature. A light source's color temperature, then, is the temperature at which the color of the horseshoe would match the color of the light source. We express this temperature in degrees, but not Fahrenheit degrees like we are used to, but in Kelvin. This scale was named after Lord Kelvin, a British inventor.
