Best Answer: RNA Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a nucleic acid polymer consisting of nucleotide monomers. RNA nucleotides contain ribose rings and uracil unlike deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains deoxyribose and thymine. RNA has ribose sugars where DNA has DeoxyRibose. both DNA and RNA have Citosine, Adenine, Guanine in RNA, other nitrogen base is are urasil in DNA, other nitrogen base is are thiamine. above are the most obvious differences.
