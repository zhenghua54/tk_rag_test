Fossil fuels were formed from plants and animals that lived up to about 300 million years ago. The Sun passed solar energy to the plants, and plants were eaten by animals. The use of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) is a problem because the burning of these fuels in industry, transport and the generation of electricity releases carbon dioxide (CO2). This is causing global warming and climate change.
