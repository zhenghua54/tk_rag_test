Syringomyelia is a rare disorder in which a cyst forms within your spinal cord. As the cyst, which is called a syrinx, expands and lengthens over time, it compresses and damages part of your spinal cord from its center outward. Damage to the spinal cord caused by a syrinx can cause symptoms like progressive pain, stiffness, and weakness in the back, shoulders, arms, and legs. Individuals with the disorder might lose the ability to feel cold and pain normally. Symptoms of the disorder are caused by the pressure the syrinx puts on the spinal cord and the damage that follows. The symptoms may include: 1  progressive weakness and pain in back, shoulders, arms, or legs. 2  inability to feel hot or cold normally.
