Everything you need to know for the first step to nursing school. If you've considered applying for nursing school, you've probably heard about the TEAS. While people seem to be more familiar with the NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN examinations, the TEAS is a common preadmission test used by many nursing programs. Decide on how many TEAS practice tests you would like to take before the actual exam and spread them out between study days and prep exam days. You may find that you need to work harder in certain areas than others. If this is the case, build in extra study days for the material you find more difficult.
