1 More serious problems can develop from impacted teeth, such as infection, damage to other teeth and bone, or a cyst. 2  One or more of your wisdom teeth may come in at an awkward angle, with the top of the tooth facing forward, backward, or to either side. To remove the wisdom tooth, your dentist will open up the gum tissue over the tooth and take out any bone that is covering the tooth. He or she will separate the tissue connecting the tooth to the bone and then remove the tooth. Sometimes the dentist will cut the tooth into smaller pieces to make it easier to remove.
