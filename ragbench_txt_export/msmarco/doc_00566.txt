In regard to the soapmaking... when lye is used to make soap it undergoes a chemical reaction. There is no longer lye, it is soap. This is why you should let your cold process soaps sit for up to 7 weeks though, so this chemical reaction can complete. Hope this helps you. Lye is a chemical when its mixed with water it can cause chemical burns because of the reaction it has. lye is a base and is neutralized by an acid, vinegar. When Lye is in powder form it is completely harmless until it comes in contact with water.
