The Sumerians spoke a language we now call Sumerian, but which they themselves referred to as eme-ĝir. The word eme means tongue, and ĝir has been variously translated as p … rincely or simply native. The Sumerian language is a language isolate, which means that it is not related to any other known language. It can be described linguistically as an agglutinative language with ergative/absolutive case alignment (see related links for definitions). 11 people found this useful.
