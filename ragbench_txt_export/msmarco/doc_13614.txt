The dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO) is an internet hoax that is designed to convince people that “dihydrogen monoxide,” a scientific name for pure water, is an extremely dangerous chemical that is present in most consumer products. They chose to use the term “dihydrogen monoxide,” the molecular structure of water containing two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, because of the negative connotations of the term “monoxide,” which is a common name for lethal carbon monoxide gas.
