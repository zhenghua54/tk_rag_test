2. An indicator is used to determine the equivalence point of a solution. Most indicators are weak acids that shift from acid to conjugate base forms. The color will change as the pH of the solution changes as a result. Purpose. The purpose of this lab is to perform a titration, using 10.0 mL of 1.5 M HCl to determine the molarity of a solution of NaOH with an unknown concentration with the use of the indicator phenolphthalein.
