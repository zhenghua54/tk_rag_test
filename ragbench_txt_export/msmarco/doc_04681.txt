Because we live within it, the Galactic disk of our own Milky Way Galaxy appears as a broad band of light across the skythe Milky Way. Near the center, the Galactic disk thickens into the Galactic bulge. The disk is surrounded by a roughly spherical Galactic halo of old stars and star clusters. Our Galaxy, like many others visible in the sky, is a spiral galaxy. The halo can be studied using variable stars, whose luminosity changes with time. Pulsating variable stars vary in brightness in a repetitive and predictable way. Two types of pulsating variable stars of great importance to astronomers are RR Lyrae variables and Cepheid variables.
