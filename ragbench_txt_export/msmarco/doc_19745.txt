A genotype is how the organism is genetically structured, includin â€¦ g recessive genes that are not apparent when looking at the organism. Some diseases, like colorblindness, are recessive and are only expressed when there is not a dominant gene to override it. The entire genetic makeup of an animal is its genome.
