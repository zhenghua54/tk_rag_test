Section 236 Rental Assistance Program (RAP). This is an early form of rental subsidy that was used for up to 20% of the units in Section 236 developments prior to the Section 8 program. Some developments still have Section 236 RAP assistance. With this subsidy, your rent is set at 30% of income. A number of apartments are subsidized under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation (or mod rehab) program. In exchange for providing a moderate level of rehabilitation to a property, the owner is provided a rent subsidy for a number of years by the local housing authority or a regional nonprofit housing agency.
