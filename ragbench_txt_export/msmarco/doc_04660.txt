In addition to bacteria, other biotechnologists use yeast in recombinant DNA technology to make human insulin. Yeast can perform more of the complicated cellular processes that occur in human cells, making it a more useful organism for producing human substances. Creating solutions for health and nutrition. Recombinant DNA technology requires the use of molecular scissors called restriction enzymes, which cut DNA at specific sequences. The cut-out gene is then inserted into a circular piece of bacterial DNA called a plasmid.
