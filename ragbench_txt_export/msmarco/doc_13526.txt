Velocity-The speed at which sound propagates through a given medium. Velocity through a given medium is inversely related to the density and directly related to stiffness of that medium. Ultrasound waves travel faster through a stiff medium, such as bone. In echocardiography, the velocity of sound is assumed to be approximately 1,540 m/sec (or 1.54 m/msec). Sound waves travel through the air with speed of 330 m/s. The typical velocities for different tissues are provided in table 1.
