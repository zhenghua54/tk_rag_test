The Cave. 1  In Plato’s theory, the cave represents people who believe that knowledge comes from what we see and hear in the world – empirical evidence. 2  The cave shows that believers of empirical knowledge are trapped in a ‘cave’ of misunderstanding. The Allegory of the cave by Plato should not be taken at face value. In essays and exams, whoever is marking it expects you to have a deeper understanding of the meaning of the theory. You can then use these to think about criticisms and then to form your own opinion.
