Not all facilities charge the same amount for the same procedure. Usually stand alone ultrasound facilities, which are not associated with hospitals, cost around $99 to $300. The same ultrasound performed at a hospital may run $200 to $1000. These ultrasound cost usually include the price for black and white pictures, videos, and/or a CD photo disk. Often the cost of an ultrasound is reimbursed by insurance companies if the procedure is considered medically necessary
