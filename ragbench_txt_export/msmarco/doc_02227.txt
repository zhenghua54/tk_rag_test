A set of regular birth control pills is designed to be similar to the menstrual cycle. There are normally 21 hormone pills (composed of the hormones that control your cycle) and 7 placebo pills that don't contain hormones. In a normal pill cycle, when you take the placebo pills, you bleed. If you skip the placebos and go straight to the next pack of hormone pills, that bleeding won't occur.
