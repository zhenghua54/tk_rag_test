The presiding officer is usually addressed as Mr. President or Madame President.. One exception is during impeachment trials of the president; the Chief Justice was referred to as Mr. Chief Justice both in 1868 and in 1999 while presiding over the Senate. The Presiding Officer is a role, not an actual office; whoever is presiding at the time is the Presiding Officer.
