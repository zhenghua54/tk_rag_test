The first time I used Viakal the limescale was so thick especially around the taps and I found I had to do a little scrubbing with the scouring side of an ordinary kitchen sponge but I did get 100% of the lime scale off easily. The Viakal comes in a white plastic bottle, this is wider at the bottom and thinner towards the top which makes it an ideal shape to hold, it also has a blue and white spray trigger on top which can be unscrewed if needed.
