Cooked sausage can be kept in the refrigerator longer than raw sausage, so it is best to go ahead and cook it. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, fresh uncooked sausage can be kept in the refrigerator only one to two days although it can be kept in the freezer for one to two months. Luncheon meats can also be kept unopened in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and in the freezer for one to two months, but the time in the refrigerator after opening is less than hot dogs at three to five days.
