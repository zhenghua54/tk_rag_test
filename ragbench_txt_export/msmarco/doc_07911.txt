Transcription takes place in the cytoplasm (prokaryote) or in the nucleus (eukaryote). The transcription is performed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. To make mRNA, RNA polymerase: 1  Binds to the DNA strand at a specific sequence of the gene called a promoter. 2  Unwinds and unlinks the two strands of DNA. 3  Uses one of the DNA strands as a guide or template.
