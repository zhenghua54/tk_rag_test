MCI also built a separate commercial Internet service MCI.net. From 1995 to 1998, MCI's network was an integral part of the global Internet backbone. MCI commercial Internet service was sold to Cable & Wireless as part of the merger of MCI with Worldcom that year. MCI also attempted a try at television in the mid-1990s. While these offers were being considered by the MCI board, WorldCom, Inc. announced it was also interested in purchasing MCI and made a higher offer than either the BT or GTE offers. On November 10, 1997 in a stock-swap deal valued at $34.7 billion, MCI accepted the buyout from WorldCom.
