Let me back up and review: 1. You got an iPhone 5S, plugged it in to iTunes and restored from a backup that was made on your iPhone 4S or you opted to restore from iCloud. If via iCloud, it can be a while depending on the amount of data it is restoring, but not 3 days. iTunes is quicker, and I can up and running in a matter of minutes.

That depends on how much data you have. There is no definitive restore time.
