__________. God's purpose for every one of His children is that we surrender to the reign and rulership of the Holy Spirit: If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit(Galatians 5:25). In other words, If He lives in you, let Him direct you!. In this message, I want to show you two things: 1  What it means to walk in the Spirit; and. 2  How you can obtain such a walk.
