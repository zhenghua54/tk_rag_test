Note: this does not mean the energy content is the same. Steam has a LOT more energy than water at the same temperature. For example, steam at 100°C contains more than six times the amount of energy than water boiling at 100°C (see here: Saturated Steam Tables). The answer to your question is then: yes, and no. In this instance, the high pressure boiling water will be at a higher temperature than the low pressure steam-a scenario where boiling water is not hotter than steam. Here, the converse is also true.
