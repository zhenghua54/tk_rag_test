Here at Jeff's Canoe Rental, we offer one and two day floats. Our one day canoe floats leave you with your choice of either a 6 or 11 mile float. If you prefer the slower paced rafts, we only offer the 6 mile float. Note: Occasionally, on weekends, our 10am, 6 mile float fills to capacity. Our 11 mile float is popular with fisherman and paddlers. On average this float takes 6-8 hours to complete. Departure time for the 11 mile float is 8am. Please arrive by 7:30am-7:45am for check-in. 6 Mile Float leaves Sunday-Friday at 10am.
