Discover the Real Spain. Nerja lies 55km east of Malaga airport and is the most easterly resort on Spain’s Costa del Sol before this Mediterranean coastline becomes known as the Costa Tropical. Although Nerja is no longer the quaint fishing village from which it developed, neither is it a high rise monstrosity like some of the resorts of the western Costa del Sol. A major part of Nerja’s appeal to tourists is that it has maintained its white village charms and property development has been mainly low rise.
