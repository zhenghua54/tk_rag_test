The test for cardiolipin antibodies may also be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and/or has a positive result on an ANA test, as the test may provide the doctor with additional information to help establish a diagnosis. Occasionally, cardiolipin testing may be ordered to help determine the cause of a positive VDRL/RPR test for syphilis. The reagents used to test for syphilis contain phospholipids and can cause a false positive result in those with cardiolipin antibodies.
