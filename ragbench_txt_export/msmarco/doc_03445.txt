Abstract. A gas-lift bubble column was used to investigate the kinetics of the reaction between oxygen and aqueous solutions of sodium sulfite in the presence of cobalt sulfate catalyst. Reaction orders have been determined for the sulfite, catalyst, and oxygen under high and low oxygen partial-pressure conditions.
