Autochrome, the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the Lumiere lumi√®re brothers in. 1907 autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato, starch which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image. fragments Color photography was explored beginning in the 1840s. Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for camera images) and could not fix the photograph to prevent the color from quickly fading when exposed to white light.
