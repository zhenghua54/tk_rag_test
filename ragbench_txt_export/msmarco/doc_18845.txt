The term snail is a common name applied to any gastropod mollusk who can retract into his shell. Thousands of species of snails live on land, in freshwater streams and ponds, and in saltwater bodies. They inhabit a range of regions including arid deserts and frigid sea depths. Snails' shells protect them from predators and the elements, and different snails have different adaptations, depending upon the regions they inhabit.
