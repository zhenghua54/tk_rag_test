Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock with small mineral crystals, formed when magma cools and solidifies rapidly; this is usually on the surface of Earth's crust, especially at incidents of seafloor spreading on the ocean floor as contact with seawater cools the magma rapidly. Basalt is the foundation of oceanic crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock made from visible mineral crystals, a result of cooling over a longer period of time under the surface of the Earth. Another difference between basalt and granite include their joints.
