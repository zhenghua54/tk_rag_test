1 Dispersion forces are the only type of intermolecular force operating between non-polar molecules, for example, dispersion forces operate between hydrogen (H 2) molecules, chlorine (Cl 2) molecules, carbon dioxide (CO 2) molecules, dinitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4) molecules and methane (CH 4) molecules.
