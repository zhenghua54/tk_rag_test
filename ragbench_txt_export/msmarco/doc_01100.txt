Poison, on the other hand, is a toxic substance that is usually secreted from an organismâ€™s external covering, be it skin or leaves. Poisons are not injected instead they have to come in contact with skin or be ingested to cause harm. Poison dart frogs and poison ivy are examples of poisonous organisms.
