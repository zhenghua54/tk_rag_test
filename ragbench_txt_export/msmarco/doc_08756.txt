All living things are made up of a cell or cells, and all cells are either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. A eukaryotic cell is a complex cell with a nucleus and many organelles. Eukaryotic cells are the building blocks of all animals, plants and fungi. Prokaryotic cells are very simple cells with fewer structures than eukaryotic cells; one primary difference is that they lack a nucleus. Ribosomes. The only true organelles in a prokaryotic cell are ribosomes, which are cytoplasmic organelles. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the ribosomes receives information from the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to create protein.
