Use diamond bits to drill hard, brittle materials like glass, ceramics and tile. Drill small holes using a round ball shaped bit. Drill holes 1/4 and larger using a diamond core bit. First, pick the shank size that fits your tool, and then choose a rounded end bit or core bit that matches the size of the hole you need. How to Drill a Hole in Glass... 1  Use diamond bits to drill your glass, not carbide bits. 2  Use diamond hole saws to drill holes 1/4 and larger or to drill holes in thick glass like glass block or wine bottles. 3  Use plenty of lubrication/coolant to keep your drill tip cool and the hole clean.
