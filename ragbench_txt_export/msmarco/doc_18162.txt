The Lewis acid-base theory can also be used to explain why nonmetal oxides such as CO 2 dissolve in water to form acids, such as carbonic acid H 2 CO 3. CO2(g) + H2O(l) H2CO3(aq). In the course of this reaction, the water molecule acts as an electron-pair donor, or Lewis base. A Lewis acid is therefore any substance, such as the H + ion, that can accept a pair of nonbonding electrons. In other words, a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor. A Lewis base is any substance, such as the OH-ion, that can donate a pair of nonbonding electrons. A Lewis base is therefore an electron-pair donor.
