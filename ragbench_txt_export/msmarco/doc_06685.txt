Foods that cause Candida are just a small part of Candida overgrowth. Usually something else has triggered the growth of the Candia, and the foods that you eat just make the problem worse. Changing your diet is one part of a multi level approach you need to stop the yeast from mutating in your body. Apart from the foods that cause Candida there are other things you need to do to eliminate the fungus from your body. Candida lives naturally in all of us. It only starts causing problems when it has mutated into a fungus, and diet alone can cause this too happen if you've been eating poor quality food for a long time.
