The answer is debatable as the modern jet engine as we know it was in development by several parties around the world at the same time.... Popular references suggest the Englishman Sir Frank Whittle invented the engine as he was the first to patent his idea, yet the German Hans Vons Ohain developed the first to fly. Frank Whittle was the first to register a patent for the turbojet engine in 1930. Hans von Ohain was granted a patent for his turbojet engine in 1936. However, Hans von Ohain's jet was the first to fly in 1939. Frank Whittle's jet first flew in in 1941.
