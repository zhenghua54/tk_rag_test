CULTURAL ETHNOCENTRISM. 1  Ethnocentrism is the belief that one's own culture is superior to that of other cultures. 2  It is a form of reductionism that reduces the other way of life to a distorted version of one's own. 1 A culture is a way of life of a group of people--the behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols that they accept, generally without thinking about them, and that are passed along by communication and imitation from one generation to the next.
