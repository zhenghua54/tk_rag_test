salt is eliminated through perspiration that's why you have a salty taste when you sweat As your body excretes the sweat to cool you off from the sweat glands, toxins and wastes are carried by the blood and through the skin to the sweat glands, where they go out in the droplet of sweat. Share to: Sweat glands generally release water, salts (mostly NaCl), and urea (a waste product of protein degradation in the liver). Sweat also contains small amounts of 2-methylphenol â€¦ and 4-methylphenol (also known as o-cresol and p-cresol, respectively) which are responsible for much of the unpleasant odor.
