The trick to great ribs is to cook them very slowly with the BBQ sauce on them. You can do this in an oven, just set the temperature to 225° F (about 107° C). I occasionally use an electric smoker, which cooks at about 200 to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. I've also used this method on my gas grill and in my oven. Cook the ribs for 4½ to 5 hours. The time it takes you to cook the ribs may vary depending on the true temperature of your grill, oven, or smoker, the temperature of the ribs when you start, and other factors.
