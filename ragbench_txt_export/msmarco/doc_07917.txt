Can someone explain DNA replication to me without getting into all the complicated details? All I need to know is what occurs with helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and ligase, like in this animation. Step 2 - Primase adds an RNA primer to each unwound DNA strand. (this is necessary in order for replication) Note that the two strands are different. One strand only needs one primer and then it can be replicated from start to finish.
