The Recruitment Process Outsourcing Association (RPOA) defines RPO as â€œa form of business process outsourcing where an employer transfers all or part of its recruitment processes to an external provider. What RPO is Not Recruitment Process Outsourcing is not remote recruiting or giving your recruiting responsibilities away to someone else. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution, or necessarily an alternative to in-house recruiters or human resource professionals.
