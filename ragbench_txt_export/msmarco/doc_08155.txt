If you can’t imagine trying to do laundry every other day while having a newborn then you may want to play it safe and buy at least 8-10 sleepers in each size. If you plan on an average of 2 sleepers each day, this would be able to get you through about 4-5 days before you have to do laundry. If you don’t mind doing laundry every other day, then you may only need 5-6 sleepers in each size. This would give you enough sleepers to plan for changes throughout the day due to diaper blowouts and spit ups.
