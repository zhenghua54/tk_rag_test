Interest payments on a note payable do not change the notes payable account, but they do reduce a companyâ€™s cash flow because the company is using its cash. When a business makes an interest payment, it reports the amount as a cash outflow in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. A note payable is a debt that is established with a written agreement, such as a bank loan. The notes payable account in the liabilities section of the balance sheet represents the total amount a business owes on these particular debts.
