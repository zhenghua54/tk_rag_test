The following structures are found in the cell, 1) Cell wall, 2) Plasma membrane, 3) Nucleus, 4) Plastids, 5) Mitochondria, 6) Golgi complex, 7) Ribosomes, 8) Cytoskeleton, 9) Micro bodies, 10) Centrosomes,11) endoplasmic reticulum, 12) central vacuole and 13) Non living cell inclusions. This is the outer most membrane of the cell, within which all protoplasmic structures are included. In plants, cell wall acts as an additional protective layer, but in animal cell, plasma membrane itself is the bounding membrane.
