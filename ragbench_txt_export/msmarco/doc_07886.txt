1 Elements such as carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, tin and sulfur, display allotropy. 2  The different physical properties displayed by allotropes of an element are explained by the fact that the atoms are arranged into molecules or crystals in different ways. Some properties of the allotropes of oxygen are shown below: The two most common, naturally occurring allotropes of carbon are graphite and diamond. There are three allotropes of phosphorus; white, red and black.
