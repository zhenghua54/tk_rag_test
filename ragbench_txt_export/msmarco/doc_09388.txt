Estrogen balance is essential for achieving and maintaining fat loss. In men and premenopausal women, too much estrogen — a condition called estrogen dominance — causes toxic fat gain, water retention, bloating, and a host of other health and wellness issues. While premenopausal women with too much estrogen tend to have the pear-shaped body type — with more weight at the hips — both men and menopausal women with this estrogen excess exhibit an apple shape with more fat accumulation in the abdominal area.
