Losing Baby Teeth. Dogs develop 28 baby teeth in early puppyhood, usually between 3 and 6 weeks. Puppy teeth are very sharp and you'll probably feel your puppy nip you with these teeth because puppies tend to chew on everything before they get their adult teeth. Adult teeth develop between 5 and 8 months. During that time, you may see some baby teeth fall out.
