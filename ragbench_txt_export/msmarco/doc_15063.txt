Americans tend to say that too many people are imprisoned, and that prison's main purpose is to take violent criminals off the street instead of punishment or rehabilitation. The United States imprisons more of its people than any other country, with 2.4 million Americans behind bars at any given moment. Proportional to the population, there are four times as many people in prison today than there were in the 1980s, and most of these people are incarcerated for non-violent offenses. 40% of the country says that too many people who have committed crimes are imprisoned in the US, while 13% says that the incarceration rate is about right. 26% think that too few people are imprisoned.
