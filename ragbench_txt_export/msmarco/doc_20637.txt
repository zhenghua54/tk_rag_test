This chart shows the outermost layer, called the superficial layer, of our major muscles. Muscles are usually work in pairs because although they can contract and shorten (flex), they are pulled by an opposite (antagonist) muscle to straighten out (extend) again. Itâ€™s the largest and the most outermost of the three flat muscles of the outside front of the abdomen. It has limited actions in both flexion and rotation of the vertebral column. One side of the obliques contracting can create lateral flexion.
