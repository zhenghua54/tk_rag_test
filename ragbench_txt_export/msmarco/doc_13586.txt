After the investigation is complete, the Board will vote on whether to grant a hearing. If a hearing is granted, you will be provided 15 minutes (for non-capital cases) to make a presentation in support of your application. Any parties objecting will also receive 15 minutes for their presentation. You must get a majority of the Board to vote in favor of granting the pardon. If the Board votes in your favor, the pardon is then sent to the Governor for approval.
