I have used Viakal on several occasions and have been pleased with the results every time, personally I do not use it every day and tend just to use it when I have tough limescale that needs removing. I particularly like Viakal is it is easy to use and can make your sink shiny very quickly without any hassle or mess. The Viakal comes in a white plastic bottle, this is wider at the bottom and thinner towards the top which makes it an ideal shape to hold, it also has a blue and white spray trigger on top which can be unscrewed if needed.
