One of the earliest uses of mastic was as chewing gum; hence, the name. Mastic-flavored chewing gum is sold in Lebanon, Turkey, and Greece. Mastic is used in ice cream, sauces, and seasoning in Lebanon. The rarity of mastic and the difficulty of its production make it expensive. As a result, imitations in the form of other resins appear in the market, sold as mastic, such as Boswellia or gum arabic. Other trees, such as Pistacia palaestina, can also produce a resin similar to mastic.
