Save. Volkswagen AG owns and manufactures the Bentley luxury car. Bentley started as a much feared race car on European racing circuits but was plagued by financial trouble in its early years. Volkswagen is largely responsible for resurrecting Bentley after 67 years of neglect under its previous owners, Roll-Royce. Volkswagen also reintroduced the Bentley as a motorsport vehicle.
