Garage Door Opener Problems. So, when the garage door opener decides to take a day off, it can leave you stuck outside, probably during a rain or snow storm. Though they may seem complicated, there really are several things most homeowners can do to diagnose and repair opener failures. And, if you are careful not to damage the door or the seal on the bottom of the door, use a flat shovel or similar tool to chip away at the ice. Once you get the door open, clear any water, ice or snow from the spot on the garage floor where the door rests when closed.
