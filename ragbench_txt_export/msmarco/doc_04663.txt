After the release of their first album, the group expanded to a septet with the additions of Davis Causey guitar, George Weaver (drummer)| (percussion) and Randall Bramblett (saxophones, keyboards and vocals). That configuration recorded the group's second album, Cats on the Coast, in 1978 (which produced a moderate hit with That's Your Secret). By the time of the third album, On the Edge, Jaimoe and Weaver had both left, replaced by Joe English.
