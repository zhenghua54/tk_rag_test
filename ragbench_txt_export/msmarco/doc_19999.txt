Chemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (â†’) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction; the arrow is read as the word yields. In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction.
