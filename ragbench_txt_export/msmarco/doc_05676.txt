There are lots of factors that contribute to what a personal trainer charges. For example, experience, certifications, facility she works at, awards, session length and more. You can expect to pay as little as $20 to well over $100. However, a pretty typical session rate is in the $50 - $60 range per hour. Be sure to interview the trainer and learn about her qualifications, certifications and experience. Ask for references and client testimonials. Treat it like a job interview.
