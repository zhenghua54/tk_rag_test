The rate of a chemical reaction depends on the medium in which the reaction occurs. It may make a difference whether a medium is aqueous or organic; polar or nonpolar; or liquid, solid, or gaseous. Reactions involving liquids and especially solids depend on the available surface area. For solids, the shape and size of the reactants makes a big difference in the reaction rate. Presence of Catalysts and Competitors. Catalysts (e.g., enzymes) lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction and increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process.
