Commercially the radioactive isotope bismuth-213 can be produced by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997 an antibody conjugate with Bi-213, which has a 45-minute half-life, and decays with the emission of an alpha-particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. Bismuth (Bi) has no stable isotopes, but does have one very long-lived isotope; thus, the standard atomic mass can be given as 208.9803987(16) u.
