Around six months of age, consider enrolling your baby into swimming lessons. There are qualified instructors and infant swim classes in many cities. Usually by nine months, babies can be taught to swim between two adults for about five seconds. Exposure to water should be like feeding schedules: small and frequent. Once baby is comfortable with water in the shower and tub, it's time to graduate from to the pool. You can usually enter this stage between one and two months of age.
