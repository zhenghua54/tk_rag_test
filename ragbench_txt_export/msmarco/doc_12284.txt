RE: Barclays closed down my account & now I can&#39;t get an account with any bank!? I was with Barclays for 6 years, I had no overdraft & a Barclay Card which I paid every month. Four months ago the cash machine ate my card & when I went into the bank to find out what was going on, I was told my account was being closed.
