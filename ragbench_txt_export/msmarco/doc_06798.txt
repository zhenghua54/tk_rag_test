No owls are not omnivores because they eat mice,lizards,and snakes. So owl is a carnivorous bird. There are exceptions to this though, as some species such as Burrowing Owls may feed on seeds and fruits when prey is lacking, but for the most part they are carnivorous though. There are very few omnivorous owls, such as Burrowing Owls who on occasion may consume fruits and seeds.
