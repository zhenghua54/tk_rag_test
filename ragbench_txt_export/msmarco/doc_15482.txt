Things to Do on Whidbey Island. When I was growing up on Whidbey Island, I went through a few phases. There was a phase, when I was around when I thought that Whidbey Island was boring, that there were no fun things to do on Whidbey island. Seriously. Get up, walk out the door, and go for a hike. The hiking is really just trying to find the best view, that’s what it’s all about. Whidbey Island has more than 100 miles of hiking and biking trails, plus miles upon miles of beautiful beach to comb over and enjoy.
