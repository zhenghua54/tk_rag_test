With heart or muscle injury, AST is often much higher than ALT (often 3-5 times as high) and levels tend to stay higher than ALT for longer than with liver injury. AST is often performed together with the ALT test or as part of a liver panel. An AST test is ordered along with several other tests to evaluate a person who has signs and symptoms of a liver disorder. Some of these may include: 1  Weakness, fatigue. 2  Loss of appetite. 3  Nausea, vomiting. 4  Abdominal swelling and/or pain. 5  Jaundice.
