Jon Stewart. There is a new king of late night, according to TV Guide Magazine 's annual survey of star salaries. And he's a very rich king. The Daily Show host Jon Stewart is now earning between $25-30 million a year, according to several sources (his network, Comedy Central, did not comment). That puts Stewart ahead of the past perennial late night salary leaders Jay Leno and David Letterman. NCIS star Mark Harmon is still the salary champ in drama, with $525,000 an episode plus a piece of the show's profits. But there could be some new titleholders on the horizon, sources tell TV Guide Magazine.
