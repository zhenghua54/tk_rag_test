King size mattress dimensions are approximately 76 inches wide by 80 inches long, making a king mattress almost the same size as two twin XL beds. This bed size is also preferable if you have children, dogs or cats that will be sharing your bed. A twin size mattress is the smallest mattress available and is best suited for one child or one adult. The dimensions of a twin size mattress are approximately 39 inches wide by 74 inches long. Taller adults may be more comfortably sleeping on a twin XL bed size.
