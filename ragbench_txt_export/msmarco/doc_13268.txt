It it is allowed to regrow the length of time depends upon how much new regrowth is required. If you injured a nerve in your lumbar spine (i.e. your low back), that may be 1 meters worth of growth to get to the feet. At 1-2 mm per day, that may take up 500 to 1000 days. If you injured a nerve at your wrist (as occurs with carpal tunnel syndrome and the median nerve), that may be 5 cm and could take 25-50 days to completely regrow. About 4-6 weeks, kind of a little bit longer Probably one of the worst piercings to get. I had double hip piercings and they backed out after about 4 months. Surface piercings are really a waste of money because eventually they will back out and leave you with a horrible scar.
