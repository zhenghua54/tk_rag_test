The world's largest temperate rain forests are found on the Pacific coast of North America. The forests start in Alaska and run along the coast to Oregon and California. Isolated patches of temperate rain forests are found in coastal Chile, Norway, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The temperate rain-forest biome, or sets of related ecosystems, support many species of flora and fauna.
