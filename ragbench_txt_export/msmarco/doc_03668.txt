It can be difficult to treat some brain tumours with chemotherapy drugs because the brain is protected by the blood brain barrier. This is a natural filter within the body. It only allows certain substances through from the blood to the brain tissues. Some drugs can cross the blood brain barrier. Some brain tumours damage the blood brain barrier so that the chemotherapy can enter the brain. Chemotherapy can be given as tablets or capsules or as injections into a vein. It is possible to inject some drugs into the fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord.
