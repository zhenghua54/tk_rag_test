Upright Freezers. Upright freezers generally use more electricity than chest freezers. This is because hot air rises; when a chest freezer is opened, the cold air stays low and within the appliance, whereas with an upright, the cold air is replaced by room-temperature air. A new 17-cubic foot upright freezer with auto defrost uses an average of 684 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, explains Efficiency Vermont. A manual defrosting freezer uses just 480 kilowatt hours, which is about 22 percent less energy.
