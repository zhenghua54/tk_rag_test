In addition to dressing Manneken Pis, it has been known on occasion for the fountain to be hooked up to a beer keg and beer has been handed out to passers-by. Both Manneken Pis and the Museum of the city are within easy walking distance from the Park Inn by Radisson Brussels Midi Hotel. After a busy day of sightseeing, guests can return to contemporary accommodation in Brussels city centre and take full advantage of the premier facilities on offer. Manneken Pis is a bronze statuette of a little boy urinating into the fountain basin, which reaches just 61cm tall. In the fifteenth century, the statue played an important role as the first drinking fountain in Brussels.
