Damart is a French company which specialises in clothing. Established in 1953 the brand became a household name in France and the UK. Although the brand specialises in a material called Thermolactyl, known for its insulation qualities, the label has expanded to include fashion items for the senior's market. In 2002, Damart entered into partnership with the Breast Cancer Campaign and has since raised Â£82,000 for breast cancer awareness through sales of its limited edition pink vest.
