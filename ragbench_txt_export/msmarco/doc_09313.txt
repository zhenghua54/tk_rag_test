A traditional Acre was a Furlong; meaning Furrows length (220 Yards or 660 Feet) long by a Chain (22 Yards or 66 Feet) wide. So 1 square Furlong (todays' city block) is 10 Acres. 8 Furlongs to a Mile. An Acre is 43,560 square feet. An Acre was originally the amount of land an ox could plough in one day   and was 1 chain wide by 10 chains long, or 22yds x 220yds or 66ft x   660ft. In modern measur â€¦ ements an acre is 43,500 square feet. 3 acres would be 130,680 square feet. The square root of 130,680 is 361.5 (361.496887953 rounded up) So if the 3 acres were perfectly square this would be measure 361.5 feet long and 361.5 feet wide. However, acres are not typically in perfect squares
