The layers are thinner in these new materials and brings out more pattern and details with less contouring. Diamondply is a laminated material that is made by dying thin layers of hardwoods and layering them together with resign and pressing them all together under extreme pressure and heat. We offer Diamondply in a wide variety of different color combinations as well as different thicknesses. We have recently made a special purchase of 3 pallets of Rosewood color Dymondwood that was hidden away in a warehouse for years. It is available in 3 thicknesses of material: 1/4, 1/2 and 2 and can be ordered as handle sets, slabs or turning squares for the 2 material.
