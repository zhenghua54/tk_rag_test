Best Answer: maybe the starter is holding it. you don,t have to take the converter bolts out to get the transmission out. the converter would just stay on the flex plate when you drop the transmission that,s all. the converter would just slide right out of the pump and stay on the flex plate. sounds more like the starter needs to be taken clean off.
