Modular Programming. Modular programming can be used to break up a large program into manageable units, or to create code that can be easily re-used. A modular program consists of a main module and one or more auxiliary modules. Each module originates from a separate source code file. The main module is compiled as an EXE, and calls functions in the auxiliary modules. The entry function in an auxiliary module is not called automatically when the module is statically linked. If the entry function is used to initialize the module, it is necessary for the main module to explicitly call it. This is particularly important for a modular GUI Designer program.
