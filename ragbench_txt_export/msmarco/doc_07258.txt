I’ve spoken to a few Realtors about renting out property, and they’ve all said that many people do not have the stomach to be landlords. If you know deep down that you can do it, then go for it. But if you have any doubts at all, then being a landlord might not be the thing for you. loading.... As a future landlord this is a great article. I’m sure a lot of new landlords don’t figure in the cost of maintenance, taxes, property taxes, insurance ect.. when they first think about becoming landlords. They also don’t think of the pitfalls of dealing with some really bad tenants.
