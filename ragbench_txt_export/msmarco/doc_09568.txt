It is essential to learn about causes of feline vomiting and learn to ask your veterinarian the right cat health questions. Vomiting in cats can be caused by a problem in any part of the gastro/intestinal system from the stomach to the small intestines to the colon as well as the mouth and esophagus. Vomiting in pets can also be caused by disorders of other organs in the body as is the case with feline diabetes or feline kidney disease.
