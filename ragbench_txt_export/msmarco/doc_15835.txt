Eastbourne maps. The Eastbourne campus is located to the west of the town centre in three main clusters: Darley Road, Hillbrow and Welkin. Our Eastbourne campus is set in the Meads area of this historic seaside town, on the edge of the dramatic Seven Sisters Country Park. It's just a mile from the town centre and even closer to the seafront. Almost 3,000 students study here, benefitting from the close-knit university community and the excellent facilities.
