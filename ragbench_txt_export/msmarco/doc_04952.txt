Garcinia cambogia is a citrus fruit that grows in Southeast Asia. An extract from the fruit rind, hydroxycitric acid (HCA), has historically been used for cooking, but it’s also been used for weight loss and to lower cholesterol. You can buy garcinia cambogia online or at most health and supplement stores, in pill form or as a powder. Sometimes, it’s also included as an ingredient in snack bars. Typical doses are between 250 and 1,000 mg each day. An older study found that garcinia cambogia was not much more effective for weight loss than a placebo (fake pill). A more recent review of studies on HCA found that there isn’t enough evidence to show that it is safe and effective for long-term use.
