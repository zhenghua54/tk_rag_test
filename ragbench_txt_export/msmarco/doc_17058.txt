Step 3. Cover pots with plastic wrap and place in a warm room to germinate---approximately 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Check daily for sprouts and to ensure the potting mix is still moist. Watermelons usually take 7 to 14 days to germinate but check seed package for exact timing for the variety you are growing. Watermelons require a long, hot summer in order to reach maturity. In the areas with short summers, start watermelon seeds indoors and transplant outside after all danger of frost has passed. In areas with a long summer watermelon can be started right in the garden bed.
