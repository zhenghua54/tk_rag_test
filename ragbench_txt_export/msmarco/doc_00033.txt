The Ghost Ant is similar to the Odorous House Ant, but the Odorous House Ant is totally brown or black in color. Workers are 1/16 inch/1.5 mm in length. The legs, pedicel, gaster, and antennae are pale, almost translucent, in color and the head and thorax are darker in color. How to Get Rid of Ghost Ants Unless you use a non-repellent spray, such as Taurus SC or FUSE Insecticide; baiting is the preferred ant control treatment. These non-repellent sprays are non-detectable by ants, so they do not avoid them as typical sprays. These sprays kill the ants by contact and by transfer.
