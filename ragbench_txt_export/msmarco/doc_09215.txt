Urea in concentrations up to 10 M is a powerful protein denaturant as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins. A mixture of urea and choline chloride is used as a deep eutectic solvent, a type of ionic liquid. Urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and is an important raw material for the chemical industry. Friedrich Woehler 'w√∂hler s discovery in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in. chemistry
