I am using Android 4 and I have installed the last release of Outlook app (april, 16th). It synchronizes the emails, contacts and calendar very well. When I want to add a new contact, my phone only show me the telephone contact and gmail contact but I cannot see the outlook contact account. To add or edit contacts from Android native apps the Microsoft account must be set up as Corporate and set to sync contacts. To add or edit all calendars in a Microsoft account from Android native apps the Outlook app must be installed and set to sync calendars.
