* If the room is about 12' x 12', a 26 or 27 chandelier would look right. * If the room is about 14' x 14', choose a 24 to 36 chandelier. * A chandelier should hang about 30 from the surface of the table to insure no bumped heads and good illumination. * A chandelier should be about 12 narrower than the width of the table over which it hangs.
