In 1905, Schlieffen was chief of the German General Staff. Europe had effectively divided into two camps by this year â€“ Germany, Austria and Italy (the Triple Alliance) on one side and Britain, France and Russia (the Triple Entente) on the other. The Schlieffen Plan was the operational plan for a designated attack on France once Russia, in response to international tension, had started to mobilise her forces near the German border.
