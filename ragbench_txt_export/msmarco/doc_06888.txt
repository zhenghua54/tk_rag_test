Queen mattress dimensions are 60 inches wide by approximately 80 inches long â€“ 6 inches wider and 5 inches longer than a full size mattress. These added inches can make all the difference in comfort, especially for couples, and have made the queen size mattress today's most popular mattress size. Sometimes still called a double mattress, a full size mattress is 53 inches wide, which is just 15 inches wider than a twin size (single). That leaves each partner only 27 inches of personal space, or about the width of a crib.
