Although the term opiate is often used as a synonym for opioid, the term opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the Papaver somniferum (opium poppy), while opioid refers to synthetic substances. The term opioid was first used in the early 1960s. Its basic meaning is opiate-like (opiates being a set of narcotic drugs derived from opium), and many sources do not define it more explicitly than that.
