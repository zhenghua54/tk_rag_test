All polyamides are made by the formation of an amide function to link two molecules of monomer together. The monomers can be amides themselves (usually in the form of a cyclic lactam such as Caprolactam), α,ω-amino acids or a stoichiometric mixture of a diamine and a diacid. For the industrial production of synthetic polyamides with at least one aliphatic monomer (nylon polymers), the amide link is produced from the condensation reaction of an amino group and a carboxylic acid group, water is eliminated. For fully aromatic polyamides or 'aramids' e.g.
