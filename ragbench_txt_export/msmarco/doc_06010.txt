GALVANIZING The galvanizing reaction takes place at between 445 and 465Â°C. When the dried steel part is immersed in the galvanizing bath the steel surface is wetted by the molten zinc and reacts to form a series of zinc-iron alloy layers. The work remains in the bath until its temperature reaches that of the molten zinc, so that all the galvanizing reactions can go to completion. In simplistic terms, while there is zinc on the surface the steel will be protected from corrosion. Hot dip galvanizing is one of a number of methods available to the surface finisher for applying a zinc coating to an item. Other techniques include electroplating, mechanical plating, and sherardising, painting with zinc-rich coatings and zinc spraying or metallising
