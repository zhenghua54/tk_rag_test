Matching DNA Samples. One of the primary responsibilities of a forensic DNA analyst is to match a DNA sample found at a crime scene, such as hair or flakes of skin, with the DNA of a suspect. DNA analysts working in health care settings generally have the sample to be analyzed delivered to them, but forensic DNA analysts sometimes have to assist in the process of recovering a sample containing genetic material to be analyzed. For example, they may help remove hair or blood samples from a piece of clothing.
