A property claims representative may work for an insurance carrier or be self-employed. Claims adjusters are more likely to become self-employed after gaining years of experience with a carrier. It is the job of the representative to make contact with claimants and schedule a time to inspect the property damage. Communicating with customers throughout the claims process is a routine aspect of a property claims representative's job.
