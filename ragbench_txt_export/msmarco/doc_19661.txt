April 2013 - Due to an early morning flight I stayed at Beijing Terminal 3 landside for 8 hours. Unfortunately you can only check-in 3 hours before departure. Airport is clean and modern, but not much fun stuff to do. Pro: you can get up to 15 hours of free wifi, there are also some stationary terminals around. Airport Hotels. If sleeping in Beijing Airport does not appeal to you, there are many hotels near the airport: 1  Hilton Beijing Capital Airport Hotel - (1 min from the airport) Free 24-hour shuttle bus runs 6am to 12:59am from Terminal 3/Gate 5 (every 15 min) and Terminal 2/Gate 3 (every 30 min).
