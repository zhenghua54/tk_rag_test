A genomic library will contain all the exons, introns, and transcriptional factors that are not found in the cDNA library. **2/24/2011** cDNA library does contain exons, which is the protein coding regions. + 42 others found this useful. Preeti Shah. Only protein coding regions will be present in a cDNA library. This also means that a cDNA library is often times tissue specific. Since the expression of mRNAs will be different in different tissues of the organism it will appear different then a genomic library.
