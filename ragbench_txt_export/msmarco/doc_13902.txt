Purpose Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear liquid produced within spaces in the brain called ventricles. Like saliva it is a filtrate of blood. It is also found inside the subarachnoid space of the meninges which surrounds both the brain and the spinal chord. The choroid plexuses are formed by the fusion of the pia mater, the most internal layer of the meninges and the ependyma, the lining of the ventricles. The Ventricles These four spaces are filled with cerebrospinal fluid and protect the brain by cushioning it and supporting its weight.
