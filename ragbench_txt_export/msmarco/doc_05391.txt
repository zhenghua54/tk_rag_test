Occupational therapists also focus much of their work on identifying and eliminating environmental barriers to independence and participation in daily activities. Occupational therapy is a client-centered practice that places emphasis on the progress towards the client's goals. Occupational therapists often work closely with professionals in physical therapy, speech therapy, nursing, social work, and the community.
