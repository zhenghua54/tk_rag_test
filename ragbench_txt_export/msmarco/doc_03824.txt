This is Bolivian money tho most people think it is Mexican because that is the most common peso. Anyway Bolivia went through a currency change in 1985 they now have a new form … of money and your 10000 mil pesos Bolivianos is worth about 10 of there new money. How much is a 2000 peso note worth in US dollars? If it is a current issue Mexican note, then it's worth $157. An old pre-1989 2000 Peso note is worth 60¢ - $4 in perfect condition to a collector.
