1 In estimating the cost having a new gas line professionally installed, expect to pay $15-$25 a linear foot to hire someone to handle everything -- labor, materials, testing and any required permits -- and there's often a minimum charge of at least $100. 1 If not, running a new line from the gas manifold (where the gas service to your house starts) to where you want the new appliance installed might take 20-30 linear feet or more, which works out to $300-$750.
