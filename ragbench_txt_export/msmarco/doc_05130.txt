The F2 is bred to a bengal and the kittens produced are called F3's. The F3 is bred to a bengal and the kittens are NOW CONSIDERED SBT (stud book tradition meaning at least 4 generations away from the leopard cat) BENGALS or F4's. Most breeders do not label their kittens on their site as F5, F6, F7 ...... but instead just refer to them as Bengals.
