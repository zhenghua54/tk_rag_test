The Hajj--the Pilgrimage to Mecca--is essentially a series of rites performed in and near Mecca, the holiest of the three holy cities of Islam--Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. For the duration of the Hajj, Mecca and the Sanctuary that surrounds it have a special status. To cross the frontiers of the Haram--which lie outside Mecca between three and 18 miles from the Ka'bah--pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia must now have a special Hajj visa in their passports.
