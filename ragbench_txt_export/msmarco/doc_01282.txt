Typhoid Vaccine: Injection. The typhoid injection is given only once, at least two weeks before travel. The injection lasts only two years compared with the five years of protection offered by the oral typhoid vaccine. After two years, a booster shot is needed for people who plan to continue traveling in countries where typhoid is common or who are otherwise at risk.
