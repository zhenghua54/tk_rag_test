IPL skin rejuvenation offers patients a wide range of benefits, including: 1  IPL is a quick in-office procedure, with almost zero needs for recovery. 2  Itâ€™s easy to fit it into your schedule and get on with the rest of your life. 3  You see great results without undergoing intensive surgery. It is important to understand that IPL skin rejuvenation utilises light waves, not laser. These terms are often used interchangeably by many individuals, however, this is not correct. A separate treatment, known as laser skin resurfacing, is also utilised as a cosmetic treatment for some similar conditions.
