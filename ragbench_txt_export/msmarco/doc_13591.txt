You may apply to the Pardons Board for a full pardon three (3) years after the date of the disposition of your most recent misdemeanor conviction and/or five (5) years after the date of the disposition of your most recent felony conviction. The granting of a pardon is an act of grace and mercy and is taken seriously. It is a thoughtful and deliberative process where many different things are considered. The process can take up to 2 years because of the large number of applications received by the Pardons Board each month.
