Knowing when did the Vietnam War start is very important to enhance our understanding on world history. It is considered as one of the most popular wars of all times because many countries aside from North Vietnam and South Vietnam fought against each other at this war. The war started due to the interest of North Vietnam to have control over South Vietnam, Cambodia as well as Laos. Because of conflicting interests, many countries supported the resistance of South Vietnam such as the United States as well as some of the members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
