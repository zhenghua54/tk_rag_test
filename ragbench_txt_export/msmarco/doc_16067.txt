CaCO3 + H2CO3 → Ca2+ + 2HCO3- (calcite + carbonic acid → calcium + bicarbonate). Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction caused by water. Water changes the chemical composition and size of minerals in rock, making them less resistant to weathering. Click on the video clip below to see hydrolysis of a relatively weathering resistant mineral, feldspar.
