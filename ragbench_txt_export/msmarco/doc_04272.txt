Common clastic sedimentary rocks in Pennsylvania are conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, claystone, and shale. Common nonclastic sedimentary rocks are limestone and dolomite. Igneous rocks are formed by the cooling of molten material, either lava (above ground) or magma (underground). Metamorphic rocks are those formed by altering igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks by heat and/or pressure. The heat and pressure cause changes in the minerals present, as well as rearranging the minerals in the rocks.
