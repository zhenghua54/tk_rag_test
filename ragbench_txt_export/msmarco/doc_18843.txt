A snail requires a clean and damp environment that is not too cramped. A large jar is big enough for a small species; a bigger snail will require an aquarium or a large plastic container. Do not simply throw away snail eggs, as they can hatch and spread live snails into local flora, wreaking havoc on native vegetation. Handle snails gently by picking them up by their shells, and do not attempt to pluck them from the sides of their aquarium, as this can cause injury.
