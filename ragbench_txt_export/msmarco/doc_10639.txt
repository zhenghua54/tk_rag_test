Here's a breakdown of LDL cholesterol levels and health: Less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) – this is your goal if you're at very high risk for a heart attack. Less than 100 mg/dL – the goal for people with heart disease or diabetes. 100 to 129 mg/dL – near or above the ideal level. 240 mg/dL and above – high. Ideally, HDL cholesterol should be above 40 mg/dL for men and above 50 mg/dL for women. The higher your HDL level, the better. The test for non-HDL cholesterol isn't usually part of screening for your total cholesterol.
