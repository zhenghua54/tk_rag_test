The Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is personal to the defendant and may not be asserted by the media or the public in general. However, both the public and media have a qualified First Amendment right to attend criminal proceedings. Similarly, there is no Sixth Amendment right to a unanimous jury (Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 [1972]). The essential feature of a jury lies in the inter-position between the accused and the accuser of the common sense judgment of a group of laymen, the Court wrote in Apodaca.
