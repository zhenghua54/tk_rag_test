Place the Walla Walla bulb sets on the soil 3 to 6 inches apart, depending on the desired size of the bulbs. Place the sets 1 inch apart if some of the onions are planned for green onions. Sprinkle enough soil on top of the onion sets to cover the bulbs. Leave the tips showing above the soil. They are considered a long day onion variety, which means they need 14 to 15 hours of daylight to form bulbs. Walla Walla onions are suitable for container growing, which allows the plants to be moved in and out of shelter. Onions in containers grow well in areas that are not normally used for gardening.
