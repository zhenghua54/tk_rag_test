In the beginning. Zendesk was started in a Copenhagen loft by three friends who used an old kitchen door as a desk. They wanted to bring a bit of zen to the chaotic world of customer support. And they wanted to do it with software that was nice to look at and easy to use. Zendesk moved its San Francisco headquarters to the Tenderloin in 2011, a famous and deeply historic neighborhood in the heart of the city that was unfortunately neglected for decades.
