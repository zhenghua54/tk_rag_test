Then there is the original cost of the ship, which can be anywhere from $600 to close to $1 billion. These rigs usually last 30-35 years, which works out to a per-day cost of $59k (again, shows up as depreciation). Current day rates for these types of ships are running around $550k/day. This is the cost to the oil company to rent the ship from the owner, companies like Transocean or Noble Corporat
