A. It's a chronic lung disease, characterized by destruction of the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) where the blood exchange oxygen and CO2 with the air. The disease leads to obstruction of the airflow, air trapping inside the lungs, and to many long term complications, and eventually to death. In the early stages of emphysema, the only result may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patients with emphysema may show an increase in the total amount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), but a decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed out after taking a deep breath (vital capacity).
