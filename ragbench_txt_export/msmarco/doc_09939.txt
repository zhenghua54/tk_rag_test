1. Dig the trenches its $10,000. 2. provide and place steel in the trenches it is $30,000 (this seems crazy to me). 3. Provide the concrete is $17,500 ($133 a yard, really high). 4. Pour the concrete costs $25 a yard or $7,500 (also seems high just for pouring. Also, for flatwork, they're quoting me by the yard for 4 slabs. For 1st floor concrete floors (above grade) they're quoting me 150 a yard for flatwork.
