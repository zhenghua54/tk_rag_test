These areas are the inguinal nodes in the groin, the axillary nodes in the armpit, and the cervical nodes in the neck. The typical lymph node is surrounded by a connective tissue capsule and divided into compartments called lymph nodules. They are widely distributed throughout the body along the lymphatic pathways where they filter the lymph before it is returned to the blood. Lymph nodes are not present in the central nervous system.
