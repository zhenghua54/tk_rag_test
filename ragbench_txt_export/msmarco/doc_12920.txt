This question lets you talk about your strengths, things which you are good at and what makes you go that extra mile to accomplish something. You are asked this question to see if you think on the same lines as the prospective employer and whether youâ€™ll fit into the company and do a good job. When they ask what stimulates you, they hope to hear some of your personal motivations that are related to the role you have applied for.
