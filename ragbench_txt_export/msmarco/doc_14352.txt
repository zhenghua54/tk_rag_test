A common question I get is how exactly does payroll time rounding work? So I thought it would be worthwhile to cover it in some more detail to help Time Clock MTS users. So, in our example above any employee clocking in after 7:30:00 AM will have their time rounded up to 7:45:00 AM. Letâ€™s say the normal clock out time for the above example is 4:30:00 PM.
