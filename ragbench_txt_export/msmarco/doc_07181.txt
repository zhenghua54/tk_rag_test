The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is a commonly used antibiotic which is active against many bacterial organisms that cause sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, skin and tissue infections and community acquired pneumonia. The combination consists of amoxicillin which is a semisynthetic, third generation penicillin and clavulanate which is a beta lactam that acts as an inhibitor of beta lactamase, the major bacterial enzyme responsible for penicillin resistance.
