Brazilian wandering spiders are widely considered the most venomous species of spider. At deadly concentrations, their venom causes loss of muscle control and breathing problems, resulting in paralysis and eventual asphyxiation. In addition, the venom causes intense pain and inflammation following a bite. Redbacks are considered one of the most dangerous species of spiders in Australia. Its neurotoxic venom is toxic to humans, with bites causing severe pain, often for over 24 hours. An antivenom is commercially available, and since its introduction in 1956, no deaths due to redback bites have been reported.+.
