Democrat Tom Wolf defeated incumbent Tom Corbett (R) in the 2014 Pennsylvania governor race. Corbett was first elected as governor of Pennsylvania in 2010. He struggled to keep support of GOP voters as his re-election race drew closer. In 2012, Corbett brought state funding for education back up to 2008 levels, still at least $500 million below the previous year without the stimulus funds. This fiscal year, Pennsylvania is spending $5.5 billion on basic education.
