Meatloaf can be made without breadcrumbs, but we as a society have become accustomed to preparing our meatloaf recipes with bread crumbs. If you want to try something different, or you happen to be out of breadcrumbs, here is a handy list of breadcrumb alternatives for your meatloaf recipe. 1) Cornflakes Crush the cornflakes, or other unsweetened cereal, in a ziploc bag and use as you would breadcrumbs. 2) Soft Bread Tear the bread into small pieces. The pieces can be used instead of dried bread crumbs. Make sure you tear or cut the bread into small enough pieces so you can incorporate it evenly into the meatloaf. 3) Quinoa Prepare according to package directions, or use leftover quinoa
