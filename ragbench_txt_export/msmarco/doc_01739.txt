If you decide not to prune them, they will continue to grow and bloom all summer, but the roses will get large. If you have your Knock Out roses as a landscape plant and you have plenty of room for them to grow, you may not need to prune your roses as heavy as I am suggesting. The answer is clearly no. The reason that I suggest to prune your roses now is to remove the first heavy flush of growth after your Knock Out roses have passed their first full display of color.
