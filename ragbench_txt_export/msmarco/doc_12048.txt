In the liquid phases, all molecules interact with one another. The stronger the interaction between a molecule and a pure liquid, the greater will be the solubility of the molecule in the liquid. All molecules interact with each other through London dispersion forces, or induced dipole interactions. In the figure below, a 2-atom molecule collides with a 3-atom molecule.
