1 In a human egg or sperm, there are 23 chromosomes, one of which is an X or Y. 2  The number of chromosomes is reduced from 46 to 23 during the process of meiosis. 3  Fertilization of the egg by the sperm restores the diploid number of 46 chromosomes. Summary: At the end of meiosis, 4 daughter cells are formed = eggs or sperm. Each contains half as many chromosomes as the parent cell (n); each cell is genetically different from its parents and from its siblings. Fertilization of an egg by a sperm restores the chromosome number to 2n.
