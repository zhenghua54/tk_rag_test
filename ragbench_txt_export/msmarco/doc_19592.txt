In fact, late medieval and early modern humanism is just the opposite. Renaissance humanism was a response to the standard educational program that focused on logic and linguistics and the other great late medieval Christian philosophy, Scholasticism.

Niethammer, to describe a program of study distinct from science and engineering. In the Early Modern period, humanism was not a philosophy but a new educational curriculum.
