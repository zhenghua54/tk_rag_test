Reasons for High Energy Use. On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features. The drawback to their small size is that a mini fridge sometimes uses more energy than a full-size refrigerator, according to a Consumer Reports review. The actual cost to run a mini fridge depends on several factors, including the size of the refrigerator and the number of hours in use.
