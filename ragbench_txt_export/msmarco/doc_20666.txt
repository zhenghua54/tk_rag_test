Protein, carb and fat guide. Protein â€“ eat 75 to 175 grams of protein per day Most people should eat between 0.5 to 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight. Eating protein helps prevent the breakdown of muscle so your weight loss is fat, not muscle. In one study where dieters doubled their protein intake, they experienced a reduced appetite and consumed fewer calories, which ultimately led to significant weight loss.
