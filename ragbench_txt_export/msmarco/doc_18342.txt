Cost of Attendance (COA) is the estimated cost to attend SDSU during the 9-month academic year. While your individual costs may vary, the COA reflects a modest, adequate living allowance. Your individual circumstances, discretionary expenses, or spending styles may not be the same as the standard COA. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code).
