The nitration process involves formation the nitronium ion (NO 2 +), followed by an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of it with benzene. The nitronium ion is generated in situ by the reaction of nitric acid and an acidic dehydration agent, typically sulfuric acid: This mixture is sometimes called mixed acid.. The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (δ H = −117 kJ/mol). World capacity for nitrobenzene in 1985 was about 1.7×10 6 tonnes.
