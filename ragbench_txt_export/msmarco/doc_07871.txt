Most People believe Naga Mani Generally forms in the hood of a cobra or king cobra. Actually it is not formed in the poison gland., but the higher cobra spirit of Naga Loka, chooses one highly special, spiritual and magical stone for itself. One is very lucky to get such a unusual gem of Naga Loka. Sri Garuda Purana:  A pearl found in the hood of a cobra is round in shape like the one obtained from the mouth of a fish and emits a dazzling effulgence from its own natural seat. After copious washing such a pearl assumes the luster of a well-polished sword.
