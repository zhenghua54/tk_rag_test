The effect that a reduction in surface wind speed will have on the  Coriolis force is to reduce the effect of the Coriolis force. Winds  blowing at higher speeds are pulled â€¦ on more by the Coriolis force,  which somewhat alters the direction in which they blow. Answered. The value of the Coriolis force is 2mvwSin(A), where; m is the mass of the moving object, v is its velocity, w is the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame, and A is the angle between the direction of v and the direction of the rotation axis (up for CC rotation).
