However, according to a 2012 nationwide survey, over three quarters of British Columbians have supplementary health benefits from group insurance plans that include physiotherapy*. Coverage can range from $200 to $500 per person, per year**, and up to $750 for some plans***. Low-income people receive supplementary coverage for physiotherapy through MSP Premium Assistance (details below). Clinic fees reflect the time spent directly with the physiotherapist. Fees are set individually and vary depending on the length of direct physiotherapist time (generally 20-60 min) and the treatment needed. Cost per visit generally fall between $63 and $190.
