Most owners are a little skeptical when it comes to a Pregnant Chihuahua. If you think you have a Chihuahua that is pregnat first look for signs. 1  The first sign is your Chihuahua will not be as energetic as she once was before and sleep more often then usual. 2  The second sign will be that her stomach will appear bigger very quickly. When these signs appear, immediately take your Chihuahua to a vet. If your Chihuahua is giving birth through cesarean section there may be fur loss due to anesthetics. In due time the fur will grow back and is perfectly normal.
