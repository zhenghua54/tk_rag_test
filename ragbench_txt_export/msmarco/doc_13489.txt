There is no simple answer or single unit of hardness, but there are many different scales and systems used to measure different kinds of hardness. The most familiar to most pe â€¦ ople would be the Mohs' scale. It is used to measure the hardness of stone on a non-linear scale from 1 to ten. Talc, the softest, is 1 and the hardest, diamond, is 10. It isn't linear because diamond is actually 42 times harder than talc, not 10 times.
