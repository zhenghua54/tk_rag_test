Thermometers are used to measure the body temperature and can be calibrated in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) or degrees Celsius (°C) depending on the global region. The normal body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C) is actually an average of temperatures. A person's normal temperature can fluctuate 1°F (0.6°C) or more or below 98.6; additionally, the body temperature fluctuates the same amount throughout the day-lower in the morning and evening while higher at mid-day. On the other end of the spectrum from a fever is hypothermia, when the body temperature falls below 97°F. Shock, prolonged exposure to cold, alcohol/drug use, and some metabolic disorders (such as diabetes mellitus) can cause hypothermia.
