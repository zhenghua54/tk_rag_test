I am planning a new garden and would like to include Sweet Summer Love Clematis but have heard that clematis vines are toxic to dogs. My dogs have never bothered any of my flower beds, but I'm not sure I want to take the chance. I have the perfect place for the vine but its in the area the dogs use most.
