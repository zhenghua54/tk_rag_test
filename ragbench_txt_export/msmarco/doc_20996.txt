If it smells bad, it is bad. The fishmonger will rarely try to peddle Salmon as fresh caught to a regular customer for fear of losing repeat business. Check the eye of the fish for clarity, cloudiness indicates poor quality. Do not hesitate to ask the market manager for a smell sample even if you are making a small purchase. If the Fish Smells Fishy reject it. If, god forbid, the question refers to a canned product that smells even slightly off, then toss it and order in a pizza. Trust your nose because if it smells bad, it is.
