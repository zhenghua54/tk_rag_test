In the early stage, the Christian concept of an angel characterized the angel as a messenger of God. Later came identification of individual angelic messengers: Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, and Lucifer. The angel is something different from God Himself, but is conceived as God's instrument. In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles.
