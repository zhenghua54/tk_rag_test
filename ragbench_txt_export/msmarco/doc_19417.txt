In underground mining, after the initial development has gained access to the coalbed, one of three methods is commonly used to extract the coal: room-and-pillar, longwall, or shortwall. It is also used to recover part of the coal left from underground mining. In the western United States, auger mining is used in conjunction with strip mining. Coal mining by the auger method entails boring horizontal or near-horizontal holes in an exposed face of the coal, and loading the coal removed by the auger.
