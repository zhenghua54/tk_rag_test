Internal recruitment (not to be confused with internal recruiters !) refers to the process of a candidate being selected from the existing workforce to take up a new job in the same organization, perhaps as a promotion, or to provide career development opportunity, or to meet a specific or urgent organizational need. These are the steps taken by a recruiter in order to select the best qualified candidate for a position/job in an organization. The process is a guide to how recruitment and selection should be carried out.
