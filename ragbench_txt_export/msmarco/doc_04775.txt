The National Pork Board recommends cooking pork chops, roasts, and tenderloin to an internal temperature between 145째 F. (medium rare) and 160째 F. (medium), followed by a 3 minute rest. Since large cuts increase approximately 10째 F. while resting, remove them from the heat at 150째 F. followed by a 10 minute rest.
