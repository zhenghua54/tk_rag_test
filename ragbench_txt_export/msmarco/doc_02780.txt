Market orientation perspectives include the decision-making perspective (Shapiro, 1988), market intelligence perspective (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990), culturally based behavioural perspective (Narver and Slater, 1990), strategic perspective (Ruekert, 1992) and customer orientation perspective (Deshpande et al., 1993). While Kohli and Jaworski (1990) consider market orientation as the implementation of the marketing concept, Narver and Slater (1990) consider it to be an organisational culture.
