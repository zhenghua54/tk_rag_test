... ... What is an After-hours Service:-. A patient is considered an after-hours patient only if he reports to the office after your normal office hours end â€” not when he presents during normal office hours and the appointment runs past closing time. It is my understanding that when you are open on the weekends with posted hours, you cannot bill for 99051 or 99050. If I understand your question, you are now open until 7 p.m. during the week and 10 a.m. until 12 p.m. on Saturdays.
