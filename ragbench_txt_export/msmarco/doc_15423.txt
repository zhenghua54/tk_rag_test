Directions. 1  Preheat oven to 400Â°F Line your pan with aluminum foil and lightly brush with olive oil, or use a bit of cooking spray. 2  Combine parsley, garlic, lemon zest, and coarse salt on the cutting board. 3  Finely chop, then combine with the breadcrumbs in a shallow plate. Easy! Oven-Baked Cod. 5 5. I made this with sole fish, so I cook them for 20 minutes. I also didn't put them in olive oil before the breadcrumbs for a lighter version. But before I put them in the oven I dizzle some drops of olive oil. The result was a very tasty fish, easy to make and very healthy.
