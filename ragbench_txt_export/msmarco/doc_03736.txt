If a person has a case of hypoxia, he or she is advised to get a pulse oximeter at home to be able to monitor the oxygen in his or her blood regularly. Mild hypoxia is when there is a 90% to 95% reading being given by the device. Moderate hypoxia is at 90% to 90% reading. There is this model of pulse oximeter known as finger pulse oximeter. This model is able to measure the saturation of hemoglobin together with the oxygen. In a normal situation, each gram of hemoglobin holds 1.34 milliliters of oxygen. The percentage is based on this normal reading.
