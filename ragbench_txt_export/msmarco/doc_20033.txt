Pork loin and pork tenderloin are not cut from the same part of the animal, and in fact, look really different â€” pork tenderloin is thin and small, while a pork loin is wide enough that you can cut steak-like pieces from it. How you cook it, though, is the main difference. 1 Size: Pork loin is a large piece of meat, so you can get it cut to order. 2  A typical roast can be anywhere from two to five pounds. 3  Texture and flavor: Fairly lean, mildly flavored meat with a thick cap of fat on top; tender if cooked properly.
