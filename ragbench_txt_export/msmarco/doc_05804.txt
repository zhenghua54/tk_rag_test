In the present study, the effect of body temperature on this acute decrease of tryptophan hydroxylase activity was examined. 2 h after a single dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (20 mg/kg, s.c.), rats exhibited hyperthermia (38.7) or hypothermia (35.8) when maintained at 25 or 6, respectively. In conclusion, lowering body temperature protects against the immediate decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase activity induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, suggesting that hyperthermia plays a prominent role in the acute as well as the long-term decrease in enzyme activity.
