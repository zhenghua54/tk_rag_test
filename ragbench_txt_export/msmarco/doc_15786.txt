Nucleotide sequence of the origin of replication of the Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome. Meijer M, Beck E, Hansen FG, Bergmans HE, Messer W, von Meyenburg K, Schaller H. The origin of replication, oriC, of the Escherichia coli chromosome was mapped within a DNA segment of 422 base pairs. The nucleotide sequence of this segment was determined. The nucleotide sequence of the replication origin is characterized by a high degree of repetitiveness due to both inverted and direct repeats. Sequence homologies were found between portions of the replication origins of E. coli and phages lambda and G4.
