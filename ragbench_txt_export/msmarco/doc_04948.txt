I marinate my pork tenderloin in a bourbon/soy sauce/brown sugar mixture for about 6 hours and then bake at 425 degrees, basting with the marinade every 5 minutes or so. They only take about 20 minutes to cook at this temperature and I take them out of the oven when the meat thermometer reads about 148 degrees.
