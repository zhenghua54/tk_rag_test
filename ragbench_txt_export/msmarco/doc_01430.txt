My rhubarb plant had 8 tall flowering stalks and some stalks on the plant that were green, showing no red on the stalks. The flowering stalks started growing before the stalks at the base. What do I do to get rhubarb we are able to eat/ This plant is about 5 years olld and has done this every year. Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable, though it is generally used as a fruit in desserts and jams. You only eat the stalks, which have a rich tart flavor. The leaves of this plant are poisonous, so be sure that they are not ingested. Rhubarb is easy to grow, but needs cool weather to thrive
