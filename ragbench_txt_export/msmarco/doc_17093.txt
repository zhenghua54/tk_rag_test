Hypocalcaemia (pronounced high-po-kal-seem-ee-ah) means a low calcium level in the blood. It is rare in people with cancer. It can be a temporary side effect of some cancer treatment drugs, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin. The main cause of low calcium levels is having the parathyroid glands in your neck removed. This may be necessary for some types of cancer in the neck area. Or it can occur if the parathyroid glands are damaged during thyroid gland surgery.
