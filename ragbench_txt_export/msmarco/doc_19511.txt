You can take $25,000 out of your RRSP to buy a home under the Home Buyers Plan (HBP) . Remember to consult the CRA website to be sure your home meets the necessary requirements. You can also withdraw money from your RRSP to pay for your education under the Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP) . If you need to withdraw money from your RRSP, you can do so, but keep in mind you will be taxed on the amount you withdraw. There are only two exceptions to this rule: buying your first home, and borrowing from your RRSP to further your education.
