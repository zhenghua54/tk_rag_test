Compound adjectives â€“ Exceptions. Note that combining an adverb and an adjective does not create a compound adjective. No hyphen is required because it is already clear that the adverb modifies the adjective rather than the subsequent noun. For example: 1  It was a terribly hot day. 2  It is an amazingly good idea. A compound adjective is formed when two or more adjectives are joined together to modify the same noun. These terms should be hyphenated to avoid confusion or ambiguity. For example: 1  Diana submitted a 6-page document. 2  She adopted a two-year-old cat.
