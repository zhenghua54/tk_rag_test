Sciatica symptoms occur when the large sciatic nerve is irritated or compressed in the lumbar spine. The sciatic nerve is the largest single nerve in the body and is composed of individual nerve roots that start by branching out from the spine in the lower back and combine to form the sciatic nerve.. 1  The sciatic nerve starts in the lower back at lumbar segment 3 (L3). The specific sciatica symptoms-the leg pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and possibly symptoms that radiate into the foot-largely depend on where the nerve is pinched. For example, a lumbar segment 5 (L5) nerve impingement can cause weakness in extension of the big toe and potentially in the ankle.
