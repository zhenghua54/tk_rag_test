Sore eyes without eye pain is a common complaint that usually resolves on its own with rest. Sore eyes accompanied by eye pain and other symptoms, including fever, discharge, redness, sudden vision changes, or eyelids that are red and swollen, should be evaluated by your health care provider. In most cases, sore eyes are not serious. Seek immediate medical care (call 911) if you have sore eyes together with eye pain, fever, discharge, redness, sudden vision changes, or eyelids that are red and swollen. Seek prompt medical care if your symptoms of sore eyes are persistent or cause you concern.
