Tweet. Once someone obtains a money judgment in California it will last for 10 years. At the end of 10 years, the judgment is no longer enforceable, unless it has been renewed. California laws specify that you can renew a judgment during the tenth year. Thus, between the end of the ninth year and the end of the 10th year, you can file a simple document with the court where the judgment was entered and breathe another 10 years of life into it.
