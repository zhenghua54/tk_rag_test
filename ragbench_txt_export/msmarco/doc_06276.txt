The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful core molecular biology technique. It is an efficient and rapid in vitro method for enzymatic amplification of specific DNA or RNA sequences from nucleic acids of various sources. A simple PCR reaction consists of a set of synthetic oligonucleotide primers that flank the target DNA sequence, target DNA, a thermostable DNA polymerase and dNTPs.
