Plunge the drain for deeper clogs. Remove the overflow drain cover by unscrewing the screws with a screwdriver and then pulling out the overflow stopper assembly from the overflow pipe. Stuff a rag into the overflow pipe to keep air from entering the pipe when you plunge the drain. Fill the tub with enough water so that the base of the plunger is covered, then perform several up-and-down plunge strokes. The air and water pressure will usually be enough to break through the clog.
