Most households can have the temperature set between 120ºF and 130ºF on their water heaters. If you are concerned about energy savings and reducing your monthly energy bill then set your heater temp to 120ºF and see if that is sufficient for your needs. Increasing your water heater temperature by just 10ºF from 130ºF to 140ºF may increase heat loss resulting in a larger electric bill from $30 to $75 dollars annually. Setting the temperature to 140ºF can also increase demand losses resulting in an annual expense of up to $500 dollars.
