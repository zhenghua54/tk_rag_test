The average construction cost is much higher than the 2011 cost, which was $184,125, and NAHB notes it is the highest itâ€™s been since 1998. The 2013 construction cost per square foot ($95) also jumped in comparison to 2011, where it was $80 per square foot. Framing and trusses are the largest component of construction costs. The cost per square foot of framing and trusses was $11 in 2011 and jumped to $16 per square foot in 2013. The reason behind these increases is possibly attributed to rising lumber costs and shortage of professional framers. Framing crews were reportedly hard to come by in 2013.
