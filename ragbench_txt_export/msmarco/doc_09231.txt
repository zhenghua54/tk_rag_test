Kingdom Animalia. The kingdom Animalia consists of multicellular, eukaryotic organisms. The eukaryotic cells that make up these individuals have a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Animal cells differ from those of plants and fungi because animal cells do not contain a cell wall.
