Most states require physical therapist assistants to have an associate’s degree from an accredited physical therapist assistant program. Physical therapist aides generally have a high school diploma and receive on-the-job training. Physical therapist assistants record patients’ progress and report the results of each treatment to the physical therapist. Physical therapist aides work under the direct supervision of a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant.
