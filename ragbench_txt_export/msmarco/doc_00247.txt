3.1 NISO's definitions. There are three main types of metadata: • Descriptive metadata describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords. • Structural metadata indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. • Administrative metadata provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.
