When electricity is generated from flowing water, this is called hydroelectric energy, and the prefix 'hydro' refers to water. Hydroelectric energy is considered a renewable energy resource because it's an energy resource that regenerates in a short time period. You can think of this like the hair on your head. While hydroelectric energy can be a very beneficial renewable resource, there are also drawbacks to using water to generate electricity. While the maintenance costs are low after the dam is built, they're very expensive to construct and require large up-front investments.
