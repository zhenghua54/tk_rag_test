Evenly spread the herb and oil mixture over the cod. Bake for approximately 12–15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork: internal temperature of the cod should be 155 degrees. Makes: 4 servings. Prep time: 5 minutes. ½ tsp. sea salt. ¼ tsp. onion powder. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Cut the cod into 5–ounce pieces or have your fish provider do this for you. Combine the olive oil, thyme, salt, and onion powder in a bowl. Mix. Rub or spray a cookie sheet with olive oil to prevent sticking (or cover the pan with parchment paper).
