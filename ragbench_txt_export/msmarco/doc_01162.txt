Step 4. Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, preheat and then set the roasting pan in your oven. Because this is a dry-heat method of cooking, do not cover the pork shoulder or add any liquid to the roasting pan. Step 1. Trim away as much visible fat as you can. A picnic-style pork shoulder contains a significant amount of internal marbling that while adding flavor also increases the amount of saturated fat in the meat. The more fat you cut off before roasting, the less fatty and healthier the meat will be.
