A  grounding electrode conductor  is the conductor between a common single grounding point in the system and the grounding electrode.  Bond  refers to the connection between the grounded conductor, the equipment grounding conductors and the grounding electrode conductor. Bonding is also used to describe connecting all of the exposed metal surfaces together to complete the equipment-grounding conductors. In some areas, the term earthing is used instead of grounding. A  grounded conductor  is a current-carrying conductor that normally carries current and is also connected to earth. Examples are the neutral conductor in AC wiring and the negative conductor in many DC systems.
