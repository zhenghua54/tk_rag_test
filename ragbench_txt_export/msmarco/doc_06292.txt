According to a 2014 Washington Post story, Uber said the average UberX driver putting in at least 40 hours a week could expect to pull in about $74,191 dollars a year in San Francisco, and a quite respectable $90, 766 dollars a year in New York City, both incomes dwarfing the average cabbie salary of $30,000 a year.
