In fact, there is some evidence that some cranberry extract tablets can boost the level of oxalate in the urine by as much as 43%. 1 Most research shows that drinking cranberry juice or taking certain cranberry extracts can lower the risk of repeated UTIs in some people. 2  Evidence suggests that taking cranberry products can reduce the occurrence of UTIs in women, most children, and people who are hospitalized.
