Giraffes live in sub-Saharan Africa, south of the Sahara Desert, from Niger all the way to Zimbabwe and Botswana. The largest concentration is in central eastern Africa. Many wild giraffes populate Kenya and Tanzania. Giraffes live in savannas, grasslands, and open woodland. The tall giraffe uses their own elongated neck and tongue to get to the top of African trees. Africa gives the ideal balance of heat, vegetation, and rain to keep the giraffe content for about 25 years.
