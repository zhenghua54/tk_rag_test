Fat body mass includes all of the bodyâ€™s fatty tissue, while lean body mass includes everything else, such as the bones, organs, and muscles. Therefore, the term lean muscle refers to the fact that muscle is part of lean body mass. These two components are usually measured in a ratio, or by percentage. Body fat percentage, the amount of the body composed of fat mass, is becoming an increasingly popular way to measure fitness levels.
