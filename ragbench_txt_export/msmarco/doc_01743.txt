You have different varieties of roses and some may start growing leaves earlier than others. It's recommended that you feed your roses when you prune in the spring. You can add compost to the soil or use rose food or an all purpose fertilizer. You can also give the roses a handful of Epsom salts for an extra dose of magnesium. It's better to move roses when they are dormant (late winter, early spring). But you can transplant them now, if you do it soon, the roots need some time to get established in the new location before the soil freezes. Water the roses well the days before digging them up. Don't prune the roses way back.
