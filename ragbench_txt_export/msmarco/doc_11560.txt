Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story The Mightiest Team in the World in Superman #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.
