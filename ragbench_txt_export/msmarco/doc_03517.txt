Hippocampus kuda can be distinguished from other seahorses by the presence of low, rounded bumps instead of the typical spines found along the body (Project Seahorse, 2003). Spotted seahorses have a characteristically thick snout and deep head (Lourie et al., 2004). Seahorse lengths are measured by recording the distance from the tip of the tail to the top of the coronet, a cup-like depression found on top of the head. Adult lengths of H. kuda typically range between 7.0 and 17.0 cm (Capuli, Torres, and Froese, 2004).
