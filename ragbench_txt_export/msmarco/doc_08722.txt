1 Elvis was a brilliant artist. 2  As a musicologist — and I consider myself one — there was always a great deal of respect for Elvis, especially during his Sun sessions. 3  As a black people, we all knew that. ( 4 In fact), Eminem is the new Elvis because, number one, he had the respect for black music that Elvis had. 1 A few months later, Elvis was back; this time, his voice was even stronger but he looked worse; two months later, he was dead and that's when my family and I went to see him, one last time, in a memorable trip where we and thousands of others, walked slowly through those gates to view his grave.
