Adjust your top oven rack so that it will accommodate the picnic shoulder ham once it is placed in your roasting pan. Keep in mind that the ham will protrude above the level of your pan as the meat will be placed on the pan's roasting rack. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the ham in your preheated oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. A meat thermometer inserted into the picnic shoulder will help you to determine when the meat is done. Allow about 30 minutes per pound cooking time
