All real estate commissions are negotiable, and are paid directly to the broker, not the agent. Agents work for the broker. Typically, it is the seller who designates how much the buyer's agents are paid. A listing commission can vary from a flat fee to a percentage of 1 % to 10% or more of the sales price.
