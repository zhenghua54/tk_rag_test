Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning organization that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace by: Catalysing an energy revolution to address the number one threat facing our planet: climate change. Greenpeace argues that because of Arctic oil drilling, an oil spill could hurt vulnerable ecosystems. It is because the drilling project in the Hoop area of the Barents Sea is too close to the sea ice and to Bear Island 175 kilometers (110 miles) away.
