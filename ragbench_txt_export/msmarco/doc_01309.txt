A spinal syrinx is a potentially very serious anatomical abnormality that exists within the interior of the spinal cord itself. A syrinx is described as a fluid-filled hollow space within the cord, which sometimes expands and spreads in both length and width, slowly destroying the spinal cord. Not all syrinxes are problematic, although all present risk factors for future catastrophic health concerns if they do grow larger or longer. When a syrinx occurs, this cavity is abnormally filled with cerebral spinal fluid, expanding the space inside the spinal cord. A true syrinx is located at an interior location of the cord which is not lined with protective ependymal cells.
