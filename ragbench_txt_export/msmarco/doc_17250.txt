Chemical engineers' median salary has more than doubled since the first survey in 1992, when it was $59,700. Those working in the petroleum industry are the highest paid. Chemical engineers in the petroleum production and refining business pull a median salary of $150,000. By the time they reach 36 years of experience, men's median salary is $140,000 and women's is $103,333, according to the chemical engineers' survey. The organization attributed the pay gap to family leave.
