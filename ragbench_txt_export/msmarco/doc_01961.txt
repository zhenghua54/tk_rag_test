She is NOT an example of someone who started late in show business. Few people become household names on the stage before they are 30. Julie Andrews was the exception. If somebody has the cash reserves and/or dedication, I wouldn't say it is too late for them to start in their mid-20s. I believe she was already 40 when she booked Best in Show.).
