Johnny. Tizer from the early 2000’s and was ended in 2006 was a beautiful unique tasting drink. Me and my pals were so excited as they started bringing out different colour versions of the drink, including purple which tasted incredible. Tizer was a dominant force in the pop/soda world. But then they changed it to the tizer we have nowadays. It now tastes disgusting and leaves a horrible feeling in your throat. I’m 18, I’ve still got along time ahead of me to see the old tizer maybe return one day. It was my favourite pop of all time.
