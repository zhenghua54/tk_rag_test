Mulan's mother is called Fa Li in the movie. In China after a girl marries she is still called by her maiden name by her friends and family, though legally she is known as Mrs. (husband's surname). Mulan's origins most likely arose as a merger between the Tuoba (Toba) clan of the Xianbei culture and the Han Chinese. The Tuoba, whom originated from the far northeast, managed to conquer and rule northern China during the Northern Wei Dynasty (AD 386-534) despite being vastly outnumbered.
