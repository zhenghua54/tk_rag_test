Tap water is drinking water that comes from an indoor tap or spigot. It is part of a larger indoor plumbing system that requires a complex supportive infrastructure, including a stable water source, piping, and water filtration to keep the water safe. He prefers buying distilled water in big containers and drinking that instead of tap water. To me, distilled water has a strange taste that almost reminds me of vinegar with a hint of sweetness. I feel that water should be totally flavorless, and since my tap water is, I prefer to drink it.
