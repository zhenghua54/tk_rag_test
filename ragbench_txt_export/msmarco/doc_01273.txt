1 Say it to your loved one when the time is right. 2  If you already said I love you and didn't mean it, and now you think the time is right, say it in a very unforgettable way. 3  They will notice the difference from the first time to the second time. 4  Make it special. Whether or not your family is comfortable expressing their love for each other, be the icebreaker and tell them. 1  You can tell them during an eventâ€”a wedding dinner, Thanksgiving, or just a family dinner. 2  You can tell them in private, in an unguarded moment.
