TEAS basics. TEAS V, the most recent version of the test, is a multiple-choice assessment of basic academic knowledge in reading, mathematics, science, and English and language usage. The four sections are timed for a total of 209 minutes (approximately 4 hours). Decide on how many TEAS practice tests you would like to take before the actual exam and spread them out between study days and prep exam days. You may find that you need to work harder in certain areas than others. If this is the case, build in extra study days for the material you find more difficult.
