Pricing will be charged based on time and complexity requirements, and quoted on a project basis. Design costs for clean-up of existing artwork – $100/hr for rough copy cleanup or creation and $40/hr for vectorized or .eps clean versions of logo or image. Once created, a job/design can be saved for repeated/future use. Engraving costs include a set-up fee of $45 per different area engraved on the same item. Actual engraving costs depend on material, size, type of engraving – simple text, logo, photo, etc.
