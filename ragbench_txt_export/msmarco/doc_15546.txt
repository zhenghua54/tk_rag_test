To determine how much you should weigh (your ideal body weight) several factors should be considered, including age, muscle-fat ratio, height, sex, and bone density. Some health professionals suggest that calculating your Body Mass Index (BMI) is the best way to decide whether your body weight is ideal. Your body fat percentage is the weight of your fat divided by your total weight. The result indicates your essential fat as well as storage fat. 1  Essential fat-this is the amount of fat we need to survive. 2  Women require a higher percentage than men. 3  Essential fat is 2%-5% in men, and 10%-13% in women.
