Croup is an upper respiratory infection that transmits similar to colds or influenza, and generally affects kids up to the age of 5. Once exposed, it can take roughly 2-5 days to develop symptoms. Croup typically can last 3-7 days. I found the information on both the Mayo Clinic website, and on this Healthy Children page: http://www.healthychildren.org/english/tips-tools/symptom-checker/pages/... The Mayo Clinic page has information on how to deal with symptoms (night wheezing, etc.), and when to see the doctor (high fever, or signs of poor oxygenation): http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/croup/DS00312/DSECTION=symptoms. Good luck, and hope both kids are back to playing together in no time
