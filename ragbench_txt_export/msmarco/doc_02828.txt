# re: Spell to bring someone back with honey. Saturday, February 07, 2009 7:01 AM by SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION. If you do not have a photograph then we can use a photograph paper and write his full name then use it as a photograph...Visualize him when doing it at all times....as if your looking at his photograph. This need to be done in a Tuesday or Fridayâ€¦. Now the Day that your ready to cast this spell I need you to grab his or her photograph and concentrate on him coming back to you. Open the cup, write his or her complete name with the red pen on back of his photograph. Merge his image on the cup and pour honey on top.
