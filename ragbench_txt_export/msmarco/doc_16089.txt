Single-Double-Triple-Shredded Mulches. Shredded bark mulch is usually sold as single, double or triple shredded, with the single shredded being the coarsest and the triple shredded the finest. Single shredded is the form of mulch that comes directly from the saw mill. Even though single shredded mulch is much less uniform with more large pieces of bark mixed into the product, it does last the longest when applied to landscape beds. The finer ground mulches are more popular due to their more uniform particle size, but they do tend to break down more rapidly.
