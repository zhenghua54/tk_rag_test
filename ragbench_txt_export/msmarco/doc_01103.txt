Tell your provider how much the new deck cost to build so that insurance coverage can be added to your policy. If the replacement value for your home is $200,000 and the deck cost $3,000, the policy will be increased to reflect the replacement cost of the new deck. The same holds true for any addition you make to your house whether it be a new garage, dormers or an additional room built on to your home.
