The tiger keelback snake takes a different approach. When females get pregnant, they slither into the forest to eat as many poisonous toads as they can find. The tiger keelback is a beautiful orange, olive, and black creature found in Japan. It defends itself with two glands on its neck, which contain poisons called bufadienolides. These irritate the airways and harm the hearts of any would-be predator. But the snake doesnâ€™t make these poisons itself.
