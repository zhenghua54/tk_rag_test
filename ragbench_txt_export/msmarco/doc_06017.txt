A gallon of heating oil, which cost $4.09 a year ago, now averages $3.23 in New Jersey, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and prices are expected to drop further. The lower prices are projected to mean savings of about $700 for the average oil customer this winter. For example, gasoline prices now average $2.41 a gallon in Bergen and Passaic counties, down from $3.30 a year ago, according to AAA. Several factors in play. The lower consumer prices reflect turmoil in the oil industry, where prices have fallen to about $60 a barrel for the first time in five years.
