This is real simple. Plug the phone into your computer and use iTunes to reset the device. Once the device is reset just do NOT activate the phone and you have an iPod Touch. Just remember that every time you power the phone completely off it will give you the activation popup and simple hit cancel and you will have your iPOD Touch.
