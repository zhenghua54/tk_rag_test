As you can see, with some planning, your excavation cost difference should be minimal. Footings: Cost for footings should be the same for a crawlspace or basement based on an average load bearing of the soil at 2000 psf (pounds per square foot). Walls: 4 foot high for crawlspace and 8 foot high for a basement.
