The pink in the crystal resonates to both the core of the earthy heart and the upper part of the root chakra. Unakite Physical Properties Unakite rock is a variety of granite with green epidote and patches of red orthoclase. It is composed of pink feldspar, green epidote and quartz (but lacks mica).
