1 The liver is responsible for metabolizing or breaking down alcohol. 2  Because alcohol is a toxin, even small amounts of alcohol cause fatty liver; long-term alcohol use can cause hepatitis and cirrhosis. 3  When the liver must process alcohol, the ability for the body to maintain stable blood sugar levels is affected. 1 Because alcohol is a diuretic that increases the output of urine, it can cause the loss of such water-soluble minerals such as zinc, magnesium and potassium. 2  Zinc status appears to be particularly affected by alcohol and zinc deficiency interferes with the ability to taste and smell, further limiting dietary intake.
