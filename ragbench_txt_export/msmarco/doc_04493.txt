Direct toxic effects of alcoholism contribute to malnutrition. Alcohol causes stomach cells to secrete too much gastric acid and histamine. Histamine produces inflammation and too much gastric acid irritates the stomach and esophagus linings and makes them vulnerable to the formation of ulcers. Alcoholism contributes to malnutrition by decreasing appetite and vital nutrients; drinking often serves as a substitute for meals, according to MayoClinic.com.
