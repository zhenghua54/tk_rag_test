Littering can also sometimes lead to wildfires because it is possible for spark to hit a piece of litter like a paper bag and start a fire. Cigarettes could also start fire if not being properly put out prior to being littered. Many litter items are not biodegradable which means that their chemical decomposition takes a very long time and these items can therefore create long-term damage to environment (as this is the case with cigarette butts).
