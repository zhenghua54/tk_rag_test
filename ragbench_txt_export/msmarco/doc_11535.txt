Yttrium and its compounds have a wide variety of uses. Yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) accounts for the elementâ€™s largest use. The oxide, as well as yttrium vanadate (YVO 4), is used with europium to make phosphors to create the red color in television tubes. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of yttrium oxide are used this way. It is also used to produce yttrium iron garnets, which are very effective microwave filters.
