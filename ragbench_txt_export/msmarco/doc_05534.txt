1 Duck and goose confit: the French way of preserving food in fat, so goose fat is perfect for this. 2  See recipe for Duck confit. 3  Use goose fat for duck, goose or pork rillettes, which is a homemade coarse pate, made from confit. 1 Pastry: Shortcrust pastry can be made with goose fat, however it can be very short and difficult to handle. 2  Here again, use less fat than if using butter or lard. 3  Cut 100g hard goose fat into 250g plain flour with a round-bladed knife. 4  No water is needed.
