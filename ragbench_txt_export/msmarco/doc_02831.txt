Radionics is based on the understanding that every person's energy patterns, frequencies, signatures, vibrations or rhythms are as unique to them as their fingerprints, and that every part of their body, down to the cell level, reflects these 'vibrations'. The particular form of ESP used in Radionics is often referred to as the radiesthetic faculty through which the practitioner, by means of a series of posed yes/no questions, obtains information. about the health of his patients to which the conscious thinking mind has no direct access.
