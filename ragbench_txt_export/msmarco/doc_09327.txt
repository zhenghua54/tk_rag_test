While some cat foods are suitable for ferrets, this one is not. (Actually, it shouldn't be fed to cats either). Both ferrets and cats are obligate carnivores and derive all necessary nutrition from meat. When choosing a food, look for one that has at least 35% protein, 20% fat, and less than 3% fiber. Ferrets are obligate carnivores, like cats, meaning that they must have meat in their diets if they are to survive. However, they require very high levels of protein and fat, â€¦ much higher than that required by a healthy cat, and so the best thing to form the basis of your ferret's diet is ferret food.
