No-cellular respiration is the process of converting glucose (C6H12O6) to ATP-a form of energy that can be used by the cell. Synthesis is a general term used for the cre â€¦ ation of a product, for example protein synthesis is the creation of a protein. (1) Glycolysis. (2) Citric Acid cycle or Krebs Cycle. (3) Oxidative phosphorylation. The cell seems to respire in a way that it takes in molecular oxygen (as an electron acceptor) and releases carbon dioxide (as an end product), hence, the process is described to be aerobic.
