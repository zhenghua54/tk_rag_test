A motor unit (a neuron and groups of muscle fibers) innervate and control muscle contraction. The unit contains a muscle endplate or organ, nerve (s), neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter in muscle that produce muscle contraction. Muscle tissue is enclosed in facia, which in turn is attached to other structures including ligament. There are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. Muscle tissue provides a) posture and body support b) locomotion and c) heat production.
