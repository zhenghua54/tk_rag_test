As the tide goes out gates in the dam which contain turbines are then opened and the flowing water passes through the turbines, thus generating energy. Tidal barrages have very high infrastructure costs and are very damaging on the local environment. Also construction of such dams is a very lengthy project. The tidal range (difference between high and low tide) needs to be in excess of five metres for the barrage to be workable. As the tide comes in, water flows through the dam into the basin. Then when the tide stops the gates are closed, which traps the water in the basin/estuary.
