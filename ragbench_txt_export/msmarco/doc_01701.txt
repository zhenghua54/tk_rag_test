The color of our titanium rings is not a paint, plate or pigment. The color in our titanium rings is caused by oxidisation. Titanium is a type of refractory metal that has an interesting relationship with oxygen. The color will not fade or chip though it can be scratched off. The titanium in not colored through the entire depth of the metal. Although titanium is a very strong metal, as with any metal it can, and will scratch, and with scratching, the titanium color can be removed. See below for further information.
