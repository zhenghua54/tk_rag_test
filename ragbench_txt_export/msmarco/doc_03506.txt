SELMA plates are used for identification of bacteria, which may cause mastitis, and should only be used for milk samples. SELMA means SEL ective MA stitis medium and the agar plate has three (SELMA) or four (SELMA PLUS) fields with different media. The other half (B) is covered with E. coli-agar. Most pathogens of the urinary tract grow on CLED agar and if they are lactose fermenting, the colour of CLED agar changes from green to yellow. The MacConkey agar is used to grow mainly gram negative bacteria.
