An overdraft facility can be granted on a secured or unsecured basis. A secured overdraft is one where you pledge an asset to the bank as security. The asset could include deposits in the bank, property or shares. If the bank stops your secured overdraft facility and you are unable to repay your debt, the bank has the right to sell your pledged assets to recover what you owe it.
