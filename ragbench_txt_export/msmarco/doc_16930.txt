Usually, you pay the entire cost of coverage (both your share and the employer's, plus a 2 percent administrative fee). As long as the prior plan exists, COBRA coverage lasts up to 18 months for most people, although it can continue as long as 36 months in some cases. 1 For example, if you expect to have a 6-month interruption between jobs and health plans, you can purchase COBRA coverage during that time. 2  COBRA coverage can be counted as creditable coverage as long as there is no significant break after your COBRA coverage ends.
