A Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) account is the normal bank account opened by an Indian going abroad with the intention of becoming an NRI. An NRI can also open this account by sending remittances from his home country or by transferring funds from his other NRO account. It’s easy to transfer funds fromanNREto an NRO account. But it’s not possible to transfer funds from an NRO account to an NRE account. Once you transfer funds fromanNREtoanNRO account, the amount is non-repatriable.
