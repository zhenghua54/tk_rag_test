Small-flowered willowherb, Epilobium parviflorum SCHREBER [Fam. Onagraceae], is widespread in Central and Eastern Europe and in disturbed areas of North America. Epilobium species have been used as remedies in folk medicine, particularly in Central Europe, for the treatment of prostate disorders and abnormal growths. Epilobium Parviflorum has an inflammation-inhibiting and healing effect on acute and chronic inflammation of the prostate and can help to reduce the gland to its normal size. It is recommended that all men over the age of 50 take this herb regularly as a preventative and to maintain prostate and bladder health.
