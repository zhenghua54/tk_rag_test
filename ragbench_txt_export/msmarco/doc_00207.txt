The term “chiasma,” which comes from the Greek, refers generally to an intersection or crossing. This term is also used in anatomy to refer to bundles of nerves at the point of intersection, like the optic chiasm, where the optic nerves cross each other. At the chiasma, the chromatids can exchange genetic information, resulting in new combinations of genetic material. When the chromatids separate and become sister chromosomes, they will contain a different mix of genetic material than their parent chromosomes.
