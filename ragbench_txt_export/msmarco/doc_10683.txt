Dr. Jeff always focuses on the big picture, which is why he values making a difference in Denver and across the country and beyond. Forever young at heart, Dr. Jeff loves the freedom, variety and sense of adventure that his mobile clinics offer. He has satellite clinics already in Mexico and Eastern Europe, contacts on every continent and a team that will follow him anywhere. Dr. Jeff lives above the clinic with his wife Petra. When he's not at the clinic, he spends time coaching high school cross-country runners and focusing on karate at the dojo. With more than 80,000-plus clients, approximately 30 surgeries a day, 30 staff, a bustling emergency room, and a far-reaching mobile clinic, Dr. Jeff is under constant pressure to keep his staff, clients and patients both healthy and happy.
