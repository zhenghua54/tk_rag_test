Osteomyelitis is an infection of medullary bone that results in the progressive inflammatory destruction of bone and the apposition of new bone. Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal femur and proximal humerus. Most commonly occurs in young children.
