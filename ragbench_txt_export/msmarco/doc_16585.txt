Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. Sometimes a degree in electronic engineering is accepted, due to the similarity of the two fields. Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.
