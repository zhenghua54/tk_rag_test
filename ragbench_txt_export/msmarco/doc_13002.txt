Prasiolite is the proper name for the green variety of Amethyst. Although it is not as well known as the purple variety, it has a similar level of energy. Yet it is a quite different stone, and comes to you from a heart based perspective. The meaning of the name Prasiolite, comes from the Greek word meaning 'leek', as its color resembles that plant. The spelling of its name may also be Praseolite, and both are correct, although the first spelling is more common. Deposits of this stone have been found in Brazil and in the USA.
