In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi. 1  Sporangiospores: spores produced by a sporangium in many fungi such as zygomycetes. 2  Zygospores: spores produced by a zygosporangium, characteristic of zygomycetes.
