A canard is an aircraft design which places the large main wing behind the smaller horizontal stabilizer. This results in a triangular shape of the aircraft, similar to a duck in flight, which is where the term canard originated (the word canard is french for duck). Many fighter jets use this design because of the increased speed and maneuverability it affords.
