My A&S pool is filling as I type and we will have our start up meeting tomorrow or the next day. We have been told by our PB that the proper protocol is 2 full weeks of brushing the plaster and then 2 weeks of chemical balancing-totalling approx. 28 days. before we can swim in it. l1234. Swim at will, but -- at start-up it is best to delay chlorination for as long as possible and than keep it low. Heavy use of the pool may make chlorination more important. ALso a lot depends on what type of stratup was done: accid or alkali start.
