Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). 1 This form was previously referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile diabetes. 2  The cause is unknown. 3  Type 2 DM begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. 4  As the disease progresses a lack of insulin may also develop.
