Ketosteril, along with low-protein diets, has been used in clinic to help lower creatinine and treat chronic renal failure, especially those that have GFR lower than 25ml/min. With low-protein diets (less than 40g/d for adults), ketosteril can be taken for long-term use. It can make use of nitrogens of non-essential amino acids and turn into essential amino acids so as to reduce urea production and at the same time avoiding malnutrition due to lack of protein intake.
