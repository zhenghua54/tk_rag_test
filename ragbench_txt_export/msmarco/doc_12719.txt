Consider a saw-mill where there are 10 workers. Nine of the workers have super accounts of $50,000 while the manager of the saw-mill has $500,000. In this case, the median super balance is $50,000, while the average super balance is $95,000. None of the workers has a super balance of $95,000 and in this case the average does not paint an accurate picture of the typical super balance at the mill. SMSFs make up 31 per cent of total super assets ($1.3 trillion) 3 and generally have higher member balances than large funds. ATO data indicate that the average super balance per SMSF is $888,433.
