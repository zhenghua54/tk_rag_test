2013 U.S. HOTEL FRANCHISE FEE GUIDE | PAGE 14 As indicated in the preceding table, franchise fees as a percentage of total rooms revenue ranged from 1.93% to 15.86% in the first-class category in 2012. The average franchise fee as a percentage of total rooms revenue was 10.99%, and the median was 11.54%. In addition, the total initial fee ranged from $0 to $155,000. We note that the hotel consortiums included in this study charge comparatively lower initial fees than those charged by the traditional franchisors. For example, the initial fee may be a minimum of $45,000 plus $300 per room for each room over 150. Thus, a hotel with 125 rooms would pay $45,000 and a hotel with 200 rooms would pay $60,000. The initial fee is paid upon submission of the franchise application.
