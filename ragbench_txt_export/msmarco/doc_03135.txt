Divergence is a specific measure of how fast the vector field is changing in the x, y, and z directions. In this section, I'll give the definition with no math: Divergence at a point (x,y,z) is the measure of the vector flow out of a surface surrounding that point. That is, imagine a vector field represents water flow. Then if the divergence is a positive number, this means water is flowing out of the point (like a water spout-this location is considered a source)
