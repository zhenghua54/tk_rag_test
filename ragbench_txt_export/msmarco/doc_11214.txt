Carer's Allowance can usually only be backdated for a maximum of three months if you claim it within three months of a decision to award a qualifying benefit to the person you care for. Similar rules apply if the person you look after goes into a care home, but Carer's Allowance will only be paid for up to four weeks for a care home stay. Find out how to challenge a Carer's Allowance decision that you're unhappy with. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015.
