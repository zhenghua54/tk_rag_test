Opioid like compounds found in natural opium latex are classified as opiates, not opioids. In 2013 between 28 and 38 million people used opioids recreationally (0.6% to 0.8% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). Many of the alkaloids and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant papaverine. Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.
