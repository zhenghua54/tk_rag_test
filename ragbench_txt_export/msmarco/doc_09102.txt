There is no simple answer to the question, 'Who invented the first steam engine and in what year?' There are several people who invented aspects of the steam engine and contributed to development of the steam engine approximately as we know it today over a period of at least 1700 years. Thomas Newcomen (1663 - 1729) is a third candidate for recognition as 'the one who invented the steam engine .' He built the first atmospheric steam engine as an improvement over Savery's device for removing water from coal mines. Newcomen's steam engine is shown in the illustration at the left.
