A Dr. Bradley Dunlap, MD, Orthopedic Surgery, answered on behalf of NorthShore University HealthSystem. How long it takes to heal a broken pinky toe depends on where the break is located. Fractures of the small toe of the foot (not the metatarsal bone in the foot) tend to heal on their own if you modify your activities.
