What is often found is that land snails live in locations where there are humans around. If you have a garden then chances are you have already seen them exploring this area as well. What you will discover is that snails species are quite abundant with thousands of them out there. Of course a snail canâ€™t move very far in a day but they do continually move most of the time to new locations. Snails are loners but they often come into contact with each other due to the feeding grounds where they find plenty for all of them to share. This is also where they find each other for mating to occur
