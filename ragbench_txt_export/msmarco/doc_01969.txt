After we removed the old siding and replaced it with Hardiplank, the homeowner was now eligible to get a discount on his insurance since the home was now 100% masonry. Cement Fiber Siding is a popular choice for many of our clients that are remodeling their homes due to the low cost vs stone, brick or stucco.
