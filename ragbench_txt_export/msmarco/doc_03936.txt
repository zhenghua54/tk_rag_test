have(2) umpire 1000 RED ANGUS COWS that are both 17 years old..they will both be weaning calves soon and marked for flushing..fault free, great uddered, and what we need in the cattle world to make money..they have produced every year, drought or not.....1 of the cows, mother, was flushed at 19.... We have kept some limo cow to 20 year old an awhile bunch to 18, now ill grant u she mite wean a 400 lb calf, but a few months ago it was worth 750 to 800 dollars. Now she made me 200 to 300.00 dollars maybe more, an she paid for herself 12 to 15 years ago ,so profit per cow is how I do it!!! 1  or to post comments.
