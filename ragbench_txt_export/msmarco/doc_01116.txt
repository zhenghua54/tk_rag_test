From traditional POS systems (POS stands for point of sale, by the way) to iPad POS systems, we asked around and did the research so you don't have to. The best POS system is affordable and easy to use, and should also do more than just accept payments and process sales. To find the best POS system for small businesses, we started by looking at POS systems used by small business owners and finding out what they liked and disliked about them. We also read customer reviews to see what users think from first-hand experience.
