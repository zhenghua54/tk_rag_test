Making the world better, one answer at a time. Temperature and altitude are inversely proportional in the troposphere. This means that as one increases, the other decreases. Approximately 165 meters up in the troposphere is equivalent to a 1 degree Celsius drop. the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude is the higher you go, the lesser the atmospheric pressure becomes. if the air above you is less, then there is less â€¦ weight being pressed upon the air you are on. anonymous boy from small heath school y8 2011.
