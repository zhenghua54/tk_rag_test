Alimony income. For purposes of making an IRA contribution, taxable alimony income counts as qualifying income. This is a special rule that permits you to build retirement savings in an IRA even if you rely on alimony income for your support. The rule applies only to taxable alimony income, though. You canâ€™t make a regular (non-rollover) contribution to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA unless you or your spouse have qualifying income. This page explains what types of income count as qualifying income for this purpose.
