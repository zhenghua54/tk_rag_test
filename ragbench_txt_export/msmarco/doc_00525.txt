1 Refinishing stairs can add about $25-$45 per step to the total cost. 2  Severely damaged floors may need boards replaced, cracks sealed, stains bleached or other repairs before being refinished; the cost will depend on how extensive the problems areas are. 1 Typically this takes about a day or two, and restores a floor that's in relatively good condition. 2  Expect to pay $340-$900 (about $1.50-$4 a square foot) to completely refinish a 15x15 foot room. 3  That generally includes sanding down to the bare wood and applying at least 2 and sometimes 3 coats of finish.
