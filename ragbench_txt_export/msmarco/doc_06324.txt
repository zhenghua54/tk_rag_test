More than two-thirds of 265 U.S. employers with layoffs during the past two years offered outplacement, at an average cost of $3,589 an employee, according to a June survey for The Wall Street Journal by the American Management Association and Institute for Corporate Productivity. The company says clients who report back to them about getting jobs do so in an average of 16 weeks. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which says it pioneered outplacement, says its clients find jobs in a median of 14 weeks.
