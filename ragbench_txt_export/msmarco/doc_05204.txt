Hummingbird Flower (Bouvardia ternifolia). A never-ending display of brilliant saffron orange is brought forth to any sunny window or conservatory by this free-branching, upright grower. Clusters of these eye-catching blooms appear on the growing tips. Best of all, after a hard pruning, they quickly come back into flower.
