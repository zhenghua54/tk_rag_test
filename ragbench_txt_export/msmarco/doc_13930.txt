Benzene to nitrobenzene. Benzene is nitrated by replacing one of the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring by a nitro group, NO 2. The benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature not exceeding 50Â°C. The benzene is first converted to nitrobenzene which is in turn reduced to phenylamine.
