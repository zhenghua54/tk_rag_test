HOCKLEY, TX. HOCKLEY, TEXAS. Hockley is thirty-six miles northwest of Houston on State Highway 6, U.S. Highway 290, and the Southern Pacific line in northwestern Harris County. The earliest settler in the vicinity was Sam McCurley, who in 1829 lived a few miles from the site of present Hockley. The Houston and Texas Central Railway began service to the community in May 1857. A post office was established there as Houseville in 1858, but the name was changed to Hockley before the end of the year. During the late 1860s efforts to make Hockley the county seat of a new county known as Hockley failed.
