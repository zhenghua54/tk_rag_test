In fact, Burger King charges its franchisees 4.5% of sales in addition to a $50,000 franchise fee, and Dunkin' Donuts has its franchisees cough up 5.9% of sales each year in addition to a franchise fee that can range anywhere from $40,000 to $80,000, depending upon the location. After 20 years, assuming the company agrees to renew the contract, another $45,000 franchise fee is charged. The total monetary layout to open a McDonald's franchise can range anywhere from $500,000 to $1.6 million. The real kicker, however, is the ongoing royalty fee.
