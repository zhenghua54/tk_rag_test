The work done by the load is equal to the area under the curve. As the load is applied, strains are produced and their presence increases the energy of our bar. This strain energy is the energy absorbed by the bar as a result of its deformation under load. From the principle of conservation of energy we know that this energy is equal to the work done by the load, assuming no other energy transfer (such as heat) occurred. by Marina Gandelsman. Strain energy is one of fundamental concepts in mechanics and its principles are widely used in practical applications to determine the response of a structure to loads.
