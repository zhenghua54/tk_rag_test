You may plan to install electrical wire outdoors for operation of pumps, lighting, and other apparatuses. Whatever the purpose, you can run your wiring overhead or in a below-ground trench. If you choose a trench, you will need to know what types of wiring and conduits you can use and how deep to bury them. For example, if you have a run of cable that is partly buried and partly above the ground, and you prefer not to splice your burial cable to a length of above-ground cable, you can use UF cable for the full cable run.
