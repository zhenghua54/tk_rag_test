The Menai Heritage Centre celebrates the two world famous bridges, the Menai Suspension Bridge-built by Thomas Telford and the Britannia Bridge-built by Robert Stephenson. It is likely that a community has existed at the location of Menai Bridge since Roman times simply because this is the shortest crossing of the Menai Strait. On 12 November 1918 Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst flew airship SSZ73 under the Menai Bridge following the armistice at the end of World War I.
