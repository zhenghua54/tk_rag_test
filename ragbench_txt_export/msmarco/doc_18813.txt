If you take your Rodeo to the dealer, it wil run around $400 to $500. The part is available aftermarket, or from Isuzu. I bought mine from a seller on eBay for around $40. It involves dropping the fuel tank and replacing the unit at the top. The instructions come with it, all parts, and a new O-ring to seal the unit.
