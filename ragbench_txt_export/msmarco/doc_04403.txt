IBM has been contracted by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to conduct an independent study of mail delivery performance, known as the Transit-Time Measurement System (TTMS). TTMS' main goal is to measure service performance of USPS mail delivery from the customer's point of view. IBM provides information to the USPS on a daily basis to help them gauge their success in meeting performance goals. The USPS is required by law to measure delivery performance as part of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. The Mail Study is funded by the USPS, and paid for through postage revenue, not tax dollars.
