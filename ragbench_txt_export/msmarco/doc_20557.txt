Prolactin is one of several hormones that is produced by the pituitary gland. Prolactin has many different roles throughout the body. Perhaps the most important role of prolactin is to stimulate milk production in women after the delivery of a baby. Hypothyroidism.

This same hormone may also cause excess prolactin to be produced from the pituitary.
