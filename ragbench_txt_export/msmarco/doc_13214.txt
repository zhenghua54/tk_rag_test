Arcus Senilis. Arcus senilis (corneal arcus) is a bilateral condition manifesting as a white ring in the periphery of the cornea. It is a lipid-rich corneal deposit that does not affect the patient's vision. It begins at the top and bottom of the cornea and spreads to form a complete ring. It is most commonly seen in elderly patients.
