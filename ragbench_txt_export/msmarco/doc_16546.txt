Plus I am trying to save around $650 each month into my savings account some of which get spent on special occasions. Together I am trying to save 33%. I am wondering if that is too much. If I should pull back a little on the savings so that I have some play money and not feel so strapped for cash. Again, with savings, you have to come to a point where you ask yourself, how much is enough. I tend to save more than the typical 3-6 months of living expenses and feel I should invest the rest but I like having the liquidity at any given moment. Great article. Thanks.
