For the unincorporated community in Wisconsin, see Slab City, Wisconsin. Slab City or The Slabs is a snowbird campsite in the Sonoran Desert 156 miles northeast of San Diego, used by recreational vehicle owners and squatters from across North America. It takes its name from the concrete slabs that remain from the abandoned World War II Marine barracks of Camp Dunlap. Located just east of State Route 111, the entrance to Slab City is easily recognized by the colorful Salvation Mountain, a small hill approximately three stories high which is entirely covered in acrylic paint, concrete and adobe and festooned with Bible verses.
