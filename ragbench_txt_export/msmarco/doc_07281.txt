The geography spatial data type, geography, represents data in a round-earth coordinate system. This type is implemented as a .NET common language runtime (CLR) data type in SQL Server. Examples. The following examples show how to add and query geography data. The first example creates a table with an identity column and a geography column GeogCol1. A third column renders the geography column into its Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation, and uses the STAsText() method.
