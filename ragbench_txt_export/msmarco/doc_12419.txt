Anti-caking – Cellulose’s ability to absorb moisture and coat ingredients in a fine powder make it the ingredient of choice for anti-caking applications. Shredded and grated cheeses, spice mixes, and powdered drink mixes are just a few of the many food items that take advantage of cellulose as an anti-caking agent. This organic compound, which is considered the most abundant on earth, is even excreted by some bacteria. Cellulose provides structure and strength to the cell walls of plants and provides fiber in our diets. Although some animals, such as ruminants, can digest cellulose, humans cannot.
