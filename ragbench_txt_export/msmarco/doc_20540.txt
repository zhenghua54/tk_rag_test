Viakal can safely be used on: Chrome fixtures, stainless steel and fibreglass surfaces, ceramic tiles, porcelain (sink, shower tray, WC, bidet), glass/plastic (shower doors, plastic baths, vases), aluminium. Viakal is also safe for septic tanks. Limescale is the build up of mineral deposits which occur in everyone's water supply. Householders in hard water areas (about 47% of the UK population) are particularly prone to limescale build-up, although it does occur with soft water aswell.
