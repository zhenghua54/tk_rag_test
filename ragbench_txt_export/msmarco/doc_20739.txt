All cells have a cell membrane and the cytoplasm (liquid medium). A nucleus is found in eukaryotic cells, along with various organelles such as ribosomes, vacuoles and mitochondria. Viruses have neither, and instead have a protein coat and a structure, usually a tail, that can penetrate a living cell. However plant cells, in addition to the cell membrane also have the cell wall outside the cell membrane. This provides mechanical rigidity to the cell and prevents the flow of larger particles. 7 people found this useful.
