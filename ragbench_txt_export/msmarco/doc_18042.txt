We’ve seen the Holstee manifesto go viral, and quite possibly make Holstee more well known for their manifesto than for the clothing line they originally started with. Other notable manifestos (while not necessarily brand manifestos) include The Fixer’s Manifesto, WorkIsNotAJob, and The Expert Enough Manifesto. Those dull paragraphs, filled with vague aspirations of “to help people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential”* are a way of the past. Today’s customers simply do not have the time or will to care about lofty and overly general objectives.
