The Basics. A fourth-cup serving of baby lima beans—about 45 grams of beans—has about 170 calories, including 5 calories from fat. You'll get 32 grams of carbohydrates, including 10 grams of dietary fiber, and 10 grams of fiber from that serving of baby limas. The same size serving of large lima beans actually has fewer calories: One-fourth cup of large lima beans has 150 calories, with no calories from fat. For vegetarians, the fact that a serving of lima beans, whether of baby lima beans or of large lima beans, contains about 4 percent of the recommended daily value for protein can be a big plus because many protein sources are derived from animals.
