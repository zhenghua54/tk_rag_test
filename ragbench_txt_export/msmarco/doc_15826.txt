Narrow-Leaved Cattail. Typha angustifolia. Cattail family (Typhaceae). Description: This perennial plant is 3-7' tall and unbranched, consisting of a flowering stalk and 4 or more leaves. The flowering stalk is light green to green, glabrous, stiff, and round in cross-section (terete). The leaves are 1 â€“6' long and up to  across. At one time, this plant was relatively uncommon in Illinois, but it has become increasingly common. In some areas, Narrow-Leaved Cattail is even more common than Typha latifolia (Common Cattail). Habitats include marshes, edges of ponds and rivers, and ditches. Narrow-Leaved Cattail is often the dominant plant in a wetland area; sometimes it is codominant with Common Cattail
