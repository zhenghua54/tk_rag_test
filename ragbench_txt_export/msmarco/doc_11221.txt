Hi, just to let you know I applied for carers on 26th may after receiving dla for my son, just called them for an update and was told a decision was made yesterday and I will get my award letter next week. And first payment will be around 29th June. It took about 5/6 weeks for me to get a letter back saying i was going to be awarded carers allowance. It said that i would get an award letter this month to tell me how much i'll be getting and then will be paid in May.
