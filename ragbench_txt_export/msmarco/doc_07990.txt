Black wool serge and other wool drapes are often used in the UK and Europe for stage masking and acoustic curtains. Wool is FR (flame-retardant) to the British standard. Drape makers manufacture wool serge curtains for permanent theater installations, architectural design, and sound dampening in public venues and concert halls.
