Best Answer: It depends on the species. Usually the smaller the bird, the shorter the lifespan. Larger birds, such as cockatoos and macaws have been known to live up to 100 years or more and often people say that birds like amazons and african greys can live to be 80 years old. These things are indeed true, but it's very rare for a bird in the wild or companion animals do live to their fullest extent.
