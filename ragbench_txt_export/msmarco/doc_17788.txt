- Don’t mow the lawn when the grass is wet. Mowing a wet or muddy lawn will damage the grass. - It is best to water in the fertilizer, so wait for the grass to dry completely before mowing your lawn. - Don’t cut the grass too short. Short grass has shallower roots and is less likely to withstand the summer heat. - Don’t wait too long to mow your lawn.
