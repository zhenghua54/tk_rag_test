Calves can be ready for weaning by 3 to 4 weeks of age; however, in Penn State studies calves weaned at 3 weeks required extra attention. The increased time and labor required to get these calves eating starter suggest that waiting until 4 weeks of age would be prudent. In two experiments, 124 male and female calves were weaned at 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of age and studied through 8 weeks of age. Milk replacer for this study contained 22 percent protein and 15 percent fat and was fed at 10 percent of birth weight.
