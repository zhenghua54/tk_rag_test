When someone is in love they'd do anything and everything just to be with them. Being in love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well. You know someone is in love by the way they look, and talk about each other making forever seem like a reality. When you know that someone is in love, is when they day dream. They also drop there grades because they pay more attention to some one else in stead of there work. They also stare at the person they like. Or sometimes they miss a lesson for going to sleep during class.
