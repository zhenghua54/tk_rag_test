Rhinoplasty, or plastic surgery of the nose, is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures. The nose occupies the prominent central area of the face, and thus determines to a major extent whether the face is considered attractive or not. You should be at least 14 or 15 years old for girls and a little later for boys because it is best to have rhinoplasty after you've completed your growth spurt. Having the surgery should be something you want and not something other people want for you.
