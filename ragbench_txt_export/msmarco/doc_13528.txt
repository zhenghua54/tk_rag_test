Tropical rainforests are warm, wet forests with many tall trees. They grow in a narrow zone near the equator. Tropical rainforests are found in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America. The largest rainforest in the world is the Amazon rainforest in South America. Tropical rainforests are home to a huge number of different plants and animals. All tropical rainforests are endangered. All tropical rainforests are found in a belt wrapping around the equator of the earth. This region is called the tropics. In the tropics the sun shines directly overhead about the same length of time every day, each day of the year. As a result, temperature is the same most days of the year.
