If you are cooking the brisket at a temperature between 225 and 250 degrees, pull it off the pit and put it in a cooler for 2 hours when the internal temp is 185. If you are cooking hot and fast (around 325 degrees F), which isn't discussed here, pull the brisket off the pit at 200 and put it in a cooler for 2 hours. Checking the Temperature While Smoking. To achieve the best results, I cook the beef brisket at 225 degrees for about 1 hour and 15 minutes per pound. The time per pound is strictly a guide and cooking times wil actually vary.
