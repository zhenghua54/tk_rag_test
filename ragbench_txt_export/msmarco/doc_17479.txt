Local plumber quoted price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax. Installation by Lowe' was $75.Very happy I checked around. 1 If you can't install the garbage disposal yourself, it's generally not a difficult or time-consuming process and you can usually hire a handyman, for anywhere from $30-$150 an hour.
