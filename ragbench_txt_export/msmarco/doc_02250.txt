There is no income, corporation or capital gain taxes in Bermuda, and the Government routinely grants an assurance under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act of 1966 that no such taxes will be imposed with respect to a particular exempted company until 2016. Bermuda companies which are owned by non-Bermudians are designated as exempted and, as such, must carry on their business outside Bermuda. Only local companies at least 60 per cent owned by Bermudians are allowed to carry on business in Bermuda.
