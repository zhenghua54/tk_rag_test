As mentioned, polysaccharides can be used for energy storage. Typically, storage takes the form of starch in both plants and animals. A starch is a chain of glucose molecules that usually takes a linear form. In plants the common storage starch is amylose; in animals the common storage starch is glycogen. Polysaccharides are long-chain monosaccharides linked together by glycosidic bonds. They're typically used for either energy (starches) or structural purposes. Linear starches such as amylose are found in plants, and glycogen is found in animals.
