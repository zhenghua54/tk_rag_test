Eloquence (from Latin eloquentia) is fluent, forcible, elegant or persuasive speaking. It is primarily the power of expressing strong emotions in striking and appropriate language, thereby producing conviction or persuasion. The term is also used for writing in a fluent style. The concept of eloquence dates to the ancient Greeks, Calliope, (one of the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne) being the Muse of epic poetry and eloquence. In modern times, colloquial speech entered into presentation styles deemed eloquent. Eloquence is both a natural talent and improved by knowledge of language, study of a specific subject to be addressed, philosophy, rationale and ability to form a persuasive set of tenets within a presentation.
