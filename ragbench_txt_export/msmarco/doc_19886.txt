I was a cross country runner for years and have suffered shin splints. It really hurts! Shin splints is an inflammation of the tissues in the lower leg causing pain with exercise. It is common in those who walk, jog, or run on hard, uneven surfaces. The pain can radiation down the front and side of the leg, extending down the back and inner leg and ankle.
