Causes of Pericardial Effusion. Most pericardial effusions are caused by inflammation of the pericardium, a condition called pericarditis. As the pericardium becomes inflamed, extra fluid is produced, leading to a pericardial effusion. Viral infections are one of the main causes of pericarditis and pericardial effusions. Infections causing pericardial effusions include cytomegalovirus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and HIV. In people with a pericardial effusion that's not due to pericarditis, there are often no symptoms. Large, serious pericardial effusions may cause symptoms including: 1  Shortness of breath. 2  Palpitations (sensation that the heart is pounding or beating fast). 3  Light-headedness or passing out. 4  Cool, clammy skin.
