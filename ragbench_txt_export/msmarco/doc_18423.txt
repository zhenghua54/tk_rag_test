1 Standard states for all species are 1 bar of partial pressure 25 °C. ( 2 This assumption matters a lot. 3  The meaning of the $^\circ$ symbol in $\Delta G^\circ$ can't be understood without it.4  The free energy of methanol liquid does not vary with pressure, i.e. $G_{liq} = G_{liq}^\circ$ at all pressures. will assume: 1  Methanol vapor is an ideal gas. 2  Standard states for all species are 1 bar of partial pressure 25 °C.
