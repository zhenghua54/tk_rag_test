Once the sodium hydroxide solution is standardized it can be used to determine the molarity of any acid solution. Consider the following example. A 50.00 mL solution of hydrochloric acid is titrated with a 0.100M solution of sodium hydroxide. The phenolphthalein end point was found at 37.50 mL of NaOH. A 25.00 mL sample of HBr is titrated with a 0.150 M standardized sodium hydroxide solution. The endpoint was reached when 18.80 mL of titrant had been added. Calculate the molar concentration of the HBr. A 20.00 mL sample of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is titrated with a 0.100
