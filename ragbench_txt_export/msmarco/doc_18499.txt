Having a child is expensive, and most of the costs are not tax deductible. Paying for pre-K can qualify for a tax break, but paying for private kindergarten or a private elementary school never does. If you qualify, you get your tax break not as a deduction, but rather as a child-care tax credit. You can only claim the credit if you need your child to be in the pre-K program so that you can work or look for work. If you're married and filing a joint return, you and your spouse must both be working or job-hunting to claim the child-care credit.
