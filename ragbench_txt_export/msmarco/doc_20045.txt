Ataxia (from Greek α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = lack of order) is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that includes gait abnormality. Wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the ATP7B gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body. Copper accumulates in the nervous system and liver and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments.
