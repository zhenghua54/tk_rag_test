Polished concrete costs about $200 a cubic meter for the concrete itself, plus another $80+ for laying, (which you need as well for the tiles!) plus between $40-$90 sqm for polishing. So it really depends on what type of tile you want, and if you compare it directly to the finish of polished concrete.
