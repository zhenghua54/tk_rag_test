Now that we know what DNA is, this is where the recombinant comes in. Recombinant DNA is the general name for taking a piece of one DNA, and and combining it with another strand of DNA. Thus, the name recombinant! Recombinant DNA is also sometimes referred to as chimera.. By combining two or more different strands of DNA, scientists are able to create a new strand of DNA. That's a very good question! rDNA stands for recombinant DNA. Before we get to the r part, we need to understand DNA. Those of you with a background in biology probably know about DNA, but a lot of ChemE's haven't seen DNA since high school biology.
