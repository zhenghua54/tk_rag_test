The cost for installing copper gutters on a house is not cheap and is seen as a luxury. Copper gutters can cost between $15 and $25 per linear foot. In comparison, most houses are outfitted with aluminum gutters, which only cost between $4 and $8 per linear foot. One factor that affects the cost of the copper gutters is the thickness of the metal being used.
