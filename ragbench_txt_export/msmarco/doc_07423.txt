Top players can earn more playing in France, but, on average, players in English leagues are very well compensated relative to other leagues. During the 2010 to 2011 season, the players in the Aviva Premiership -- England's top rugby league -- earned an average of 85,000 pounds sterling -- approximately $130,000. The top professional rugby players in France receive the highest salaries in the world. In fact, four of the five highest paid professional rugby players in the world all played for teams in France's Top 14 -- the most competitive league in France -- in 2011.
