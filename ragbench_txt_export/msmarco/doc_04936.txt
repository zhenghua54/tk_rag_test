With a population of over 15,000, Wisconsin has fewer Amish than only Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. The Wisconsin Amish population is spread over nearly four dozen settlements across the state, and a total of 120 church districts (Young Center, 2010). Wisconsin is a state which saw Amish arrive relatively late compared to other states associated with the Plain People. Though the first Amish only began to settle in Wisconsin in the early 1900s, the Wisconsin Amish presence has grown to become the fourth-largest in North America.
