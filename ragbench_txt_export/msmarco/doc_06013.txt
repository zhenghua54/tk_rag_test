The dominating part is the energy cost (for a filter with filter class F7 the energy cost is 80 % of the total cost [1]). Using a filter with lower pressure drop (more filter bags) will reduce the cost for energy use, but the filter cost will increase. When the program has calculated the filter cost for the installation it automatically changes one of the filters to a 6-pocket filter (extending the filtration area in order to reduce the pressure drop and lower the energy consumption) and runs the calculation one more time.
