According to the 2008 U.S. Census the size of the average home was approximately 2,520 square feet, which assumes a two-story structure with a footprint of approximately 24'x50' . 1 According to the Craftsman Book Company a home as described above, with mid-range materials, a normal foundation with full basement, efficient doors and windows, all appliances, and turnkey finishing would run at an average of $295,000 to complete. 2  This does not include acquisition of the acreage or any furnishings.
