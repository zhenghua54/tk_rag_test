Carboxylic acids are commonly named as indicated in the table below. Although rarely used, IUPAC-recommended names also exist. For example, butyric acid (C 3 H 7 CO 2 H) is, according to IUPAC guidelines, also known as butanoic acid. The general formula of a carboxylic acid is Râˆ’C(O)OH with R referring to the rest of the (possibly quite large) molecule. Carboxylic acids occur widely and include the amino acids and acetic acid (as vinegar). Salts and esters of carboxylic acids are called carboxylates.
