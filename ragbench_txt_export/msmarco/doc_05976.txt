It is best to root them in sand in a shaded area. Only the hydrangeas which naturally have pink flowers will bloom blue, and only if grown in acid soil. These lovely plants grow without difficulty in a wide variety of soils but prefer fairly rich, moist soil. They can grow in full sun if they are watered well, but they will bloom more freely in partial shade. The most common variety in our area is the French Hydrangea. Easy to grow in rich, moist soil, it has a large, mounding shape and can achieve heights of four feet in a year. The large foliage is dark green, but being deciduous, is gone in the winter.
