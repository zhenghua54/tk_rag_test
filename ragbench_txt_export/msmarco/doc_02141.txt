1 Cholesterol is not found in the membranes of plant cells. 2  Glycolipids are located on cell membrane surfaces and have a carbohydrate sugar chain attached to them. 3  They help the cell to recognize other cells of the body. It also serves as a base of attachment for the cytoskeleton in some organisms and the cell wall in others. Thus the cell membrane also serves to help support the cell and help maintain its shape. Animal cells, plant cells, prokaryotic cells, and fungal cells have cell membranes.
