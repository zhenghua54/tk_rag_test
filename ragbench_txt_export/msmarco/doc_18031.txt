Transformation [ edit | edit source]. Transformation is the process by which a donor DNA molecule is taken up from the external environment and incorporated into the genome of the recipient cell. Allows for Recombinant DNA Technology. Involves use of plasmids. Transduction [ edit | edit source]. Involves transfer genetic material from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage. Acting as a vector, the virus carries its own genome plus a fragment of DNA from the bacterium it has recently infected. If the host bacterium survives the viral attack, recombination may occur,
