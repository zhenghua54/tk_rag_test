Know your options before beginning your bachelor’s degree program. Print. It’s a common misconception that bachelor’s degrees always take four years to complete. Four years is the traditional amount of time many students take to earn a bachelor’s degree, but it’s different for non-traditional adult students. Online bachelor’s degree programs typically take between three and five years, depending on the amount of time you have to devote to your studies. The required courses are similar to a campus-based program, but are completed either mostly or entirely on the computer.
