If you don't feel like you can give a complete interview answer in 60 seconds, shoot for a 90-second answer. Some behavioral questions, such as describing how you might handle a difficult situation with a co-worker or ways you might contribute to a team project require extended details and analyses. Rehearsing answers to common interview questions can help you prepared so you don't get rattled and ramble too long about irrelevant details. A hiring manager will likely ask open-ended questions that don't have simple yes or no answers, so take time to answer them thoroughly.
