It just depends on where you are located and what age range you are willing to take. Also if you offer transportation to and from school, or if you will only take children in the school district that the center is in. Typically for infants it is like $150 to $175 per week per child. Toddlers, about $150 per week. School aged kids for before and after school care, about $100. Report Abuse. It greatly depends on the age of the child, what you offer, and where you are located. I work in an infant room in Minneapolis, and our center charges $83/DAY for infants. It lessens as they get older...I think the preschool rooms are around $50/day.
