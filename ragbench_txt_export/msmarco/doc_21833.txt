If you like a scarf with long ends to wrap around your shoulders, this is the pattern for you. I have used the same slipped stitch edge on this scarf. To make this edge, the first stitch of every row is slipped knitwise (as if to knit) while holding the yarn at the back of the work (wyib). With one small change to the pattern, you get a longer, narrower scarf. In this pattern, the same number of stitches are cast on and bound off. The same amount of yarn is used. Remember to weigh your yarn before you begin and periodically while working the increase section.
