A standard king size bed is 5 feet wide and 6 feet 6 inches long (150 x 198 cm). Please note: from a king size bed and upwards the standard length increases by 3 inches to 6 feet 6 inches or about 2 metres. A Queen size bed in the US refers to a 60 inch wide by 80 inch long mattress (152 x 203 cm), although it is more commonly referred to in the UK as a ‘ King’ instead being of similar dimension.
