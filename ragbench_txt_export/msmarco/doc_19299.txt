You can buy acoustic ceiling tiles in either 2’x2’ or 2’x4’ sizes. It will cost about $1,000-$1,700 to install an acoustic ceiling system in an average 12’x14’ room. Most contractors will charge between $2 and $5 per square foot for labor. A modest set of 12, 2x2 tiles can cost from $25-$40. There are more extravagant tiles which can cost as much as $100 for a set of 12. Labor costs should remain constant no matter how much you spend on the tiles.
