In a Cartesian coordinate system with coordinates (x, y) the unit square is defined as the square consisting of the points where both x and y lie in a closed unit interval from 0 to 1 on their respective axes. That is, the unit square is the Cartesian product I Ã— I, where I denotes the closed unit interval. Often, the unit square refers specifically to the square in the Cartesian plane with corners at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).
