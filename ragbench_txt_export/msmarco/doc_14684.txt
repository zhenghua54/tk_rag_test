MSM stands for methyl-sulfonyl-methane, which is sulfur. MSM is an organic white sulfur powder, which comes from the ocean and is water soluble. IT IS A FOOD found in plants, meats, dairy products and vegetation. It is the third largest nutrient found in your body. We suggest you do not use synthetically produced MSM. The organic sulfur we use and offer on our shopping cart is very well absorbed. The precise dosage is not real critical, since MSM is a macro mineral food. Personally I started with one tsp 3x per day and NOW take one tsp 2x per day.
