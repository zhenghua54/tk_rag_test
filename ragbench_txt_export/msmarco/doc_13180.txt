Osteoblast (from the Greek combining forms for  bone , ὀστέο-, osteo-and βλαστάνω, blastanō germinate) are cells with single nuclei that synthesize bone. Individual cells cannot make bone, and the group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon; the basis of this is discussed in Organization and ultrastructure of osteoblasts below.
