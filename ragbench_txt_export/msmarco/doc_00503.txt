ZipLine. Post 2. @alisha-- The incubation period for viral and bacterial meningitis is similar. It's usually about ten days for both but it can range anywhere from two days to two weeks depending on the cause of the meningitis and the individual. There is also fungal meningitis, but fungal meningitis is different. The incubation period for meningitis can vary between 2 to 14 days. Children under the age of five face a high risk of contracting meningitis-related infections. The spinal cord is normally enclosed within membranes called meninges, which protect and cushion long nerves.
