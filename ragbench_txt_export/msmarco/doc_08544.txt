At night, most people are inclined to enjoy a cooler setting as opposed to a warmer one. A normal temperature for that would be around 67-69 degrees. And for the daytime 69-72. If it is winter then your preferences may change because the overall temperature of your house goes down. It's all subjective, but I've found that most people find comfort in the 68-70 range overall. I know that advice has been given about having a home too warm or too cold but am not sure what a healthy temperature is. I like a very warm house in winter but don't like the attached bills! We keep our programmable thermostat at 68 degrees F. We have kids but we're all healthy with no special needs.
