I've taken it for my asthma, arthritis, lupus, bronchitis, pneumonia and even a severe case of poison ivy. At my highest dose/time, I was on 120 mg (about double what the normal starting daily dose is) and was on that dose for over a year. Obviously I had the worst side effects when I was at that level.
