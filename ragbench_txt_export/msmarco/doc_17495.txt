EPDM rubber is closely related to ethylene propylene rubber, but EPDM rubber has a diene-component. EPDM rubber is similar to EPT rubber (ethylene-propylene terpolymer) and EPR (ethylene propylene rubber). The ethylene content of EPDM rubber is around 45% to 85%. Higher ethylene content means higher loading, better mixing and improved extrusion. What is EPDM Rubber. EPDM rubber (ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber) is a type of synthetic rubber. EPDM is an elastomer, which is an elastic polymer or links of identical large molecules than have both viscosity and elasticity.
