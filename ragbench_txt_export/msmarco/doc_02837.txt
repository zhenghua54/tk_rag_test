Radionics is a method of healing and diagnosing at a distance using the unique extra-sensory faculties of the operator supported and amplified by a physical instrument, device, geometric pattern, energy or substance. The particular form of ESP used in Radionics is often referred to as the radiesthetic faculty through which the practitioner, by means of a series of posed yes/no questions, obtains information. about the health of his patients to which the conscious thinking mind has no direct access.
