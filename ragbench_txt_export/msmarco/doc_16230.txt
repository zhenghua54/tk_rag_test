In-house assets include assets of a fund that are subject to a lease or lease arrangement between the trustee and a related party. One exception to this rule is where the lease or lease arrangement is in respect of business real property. However, where the complexity arises is where the related party tenant wishes to make changes or improvements to the property. Invariably, on the exit of a prior commercial tenant a refurbishment is required. Indeed, economic changes may force a change in use and layout during a lease term.
