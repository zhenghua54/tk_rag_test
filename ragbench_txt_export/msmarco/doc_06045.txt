If you're worried about the cost of the phone-call, you can ask an adviser to call you back. You can text 'legalaid' and your name to 80010 and an adviser will call you back within 24 hours. The helpline has a translation service if you would like advice in a language other than English or Welsh. You can deduct your mortgage or any charges on your home, up to a maximum of Â£100,000. This is called mortgage disregard. You can also deduct 3% of the market value of your home (the amount for which it could be sold for on the open market) for sales costs.
