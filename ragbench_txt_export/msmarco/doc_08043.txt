Some people feed the calves while others just wean them on pasture. Calves 4-5 months of age transition better, as theyâ€™re used to eating forage. Younger calves are trickier, but if you can meet the nutrient requirements of calves just 2-3 months old, they can be successfully weaned that young, Lardy adds.
