Dustin Johnson began his 2013 season with a win at the season opening Hyundai Tournament of Champions, an event reserved for winners from the past season. Johnson won by four strokes over defending champion Steve Stricker. The event was Johnsonâ€™s seventh PGA Tour win and his third in a 54-hole event. As an amateur, Dustin won the Monroe Invitational and the Northeast Amateur in 2007 and played on the winning 2007 Walker Cup and Palmer Cup teams. Dustin Johnson is the first player since Tiger Woods to win at least once in each of his first seven seasons coming out of college.
