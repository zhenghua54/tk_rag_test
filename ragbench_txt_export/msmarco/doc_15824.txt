1 Typha latifolia x T. angustifolia hybrids (Typha x glauca .), commonly known as Hybrid or Glaucus Cattail, are especially common in the Midwest and may develop extensive pure stands by rhizomatous growth. 2  Hybrids are almost always intermediate in form between the parent species. 1 Distribution of these species overlaps considerably in the contiguous US. 2  Where Typha latifolia and Typha angustifolia occur together, hybrids are common, especially in habitats with variable water levels.
