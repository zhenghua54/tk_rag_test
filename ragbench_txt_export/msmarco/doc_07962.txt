Fabric vs Leather Sofas. Sofas are some of the biggest pieces of furniture in a living room. With the potential for such great impact, it is just appropriate to invest some time into thinking about what kind of the sofa to get. One of the main considerations should be the type of material used for the sofa. Dust mites and stains are the enemy of fabric. Fortunately, there are solutions that can be applied to the surface of the sofa to make them water and spill-resistant. The owners should also dust and shampoo the sofa regularly to prevent deep staining. For more info on the types of fabric, check out Furniture Fabrics.
