The hyphen (‐) is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. The use of hyphens is called hyphenation. The hyphen should not be confused with dashes (‒ , – , — , ―), which are longer and have different uses, or with the minus sign (−), which is also longer in some contexts.
