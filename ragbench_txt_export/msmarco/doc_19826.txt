From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In chemistry, a precursor is a compound that participates in the chemical reaction that produces another compound. In biochemistry, the term precursor is used more specifically to refer to a chemical compound preceding another in a metabolic pathway. Raman spectroscopy has been successfully tested to detect explosives and their precursors. A portable, advanced sensor based on infrared spectroscopy in a hollow fiber matched to a silicon-micromachined fast gas chromatography column can analyze illegal stimulants and precursors with nanogram-level sensitivity.
