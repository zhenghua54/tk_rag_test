An itch is a very slight form of pain from your nerves. There is usually something touching you and your body feels threatened by the contact, and so you itch to remove it fro â€¦ m your skin. In bites and stings it's because the nerves are stimulated by the poison/acid/alkali released into the bite. I have this sensation too. It is not skin related (unless it is an allergic reaction that makes you both cough and have a rash), but rather a nervous symptom-that is, related to the nerves in your chest.
