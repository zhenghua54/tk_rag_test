It largely depends on what type of fish. Generally, a group of fish is called a school. However, sharks are fish as well and a group of sharks is called a gam, herd, pod, or shiver. Rays are also fish, but groups of rays are called a fever, draught, drift, scale, school, or shoal. Eels, another type of fish, in a group are called a swarm. A group of barracuda are called a battery.
