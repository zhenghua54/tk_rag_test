In humans, prolactin is produced at least in the pituitary, decidua, myometrium, breast, lymphocytes, leukocytes and prostate. Pituitary PRL is controlled by the Pit-1 transcription factor and ultimately dopamine, extrapituitary PRL is controlled by a superdistal promoter and apparently unaffected by dopamine. There is a diurnal as well as an ovulatory cycle in prolactin secretion. In many mammals, there is also a seasonal change in prolactin release. During pregnancy, high circulating concentrations of estrogen and progesterone increase prolactin levels by 10- to 20-fold.
