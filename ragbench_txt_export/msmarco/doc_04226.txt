Marketers often track both the CPM and the CPI, or cost per interaction, for social media, and they use both metrics to judge the costs and effectiveness of their marketing efforts. The average CPM for social media banner advertising is $1 to $4, but the price can vary considerably. CPM for magazine ads is calculated on the estimated circulation size of the magazine, which you can find in the magazine's media kit. Most provide audited figures, including the total number of readers broken down by subscribers and newsstand sales.
