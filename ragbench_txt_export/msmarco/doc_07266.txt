The more integrated the economies become, the fewer trade barriers exist and the more economic and political coordination there is between the member countries. By integrating the economies of more than one country, the short-term benefits from the use of tariffs and other trade barriers is diminished. There are varying levels of economic integration, including preferential trade agreements (PTA), free trade areas (FTA), customs unions, common markets and economic and monetary unions.
