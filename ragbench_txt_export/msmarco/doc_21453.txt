Bathroom renovations, Victoria BC. A bathroom renovation is a great way to improve your home. There are many benefits to this semi expensive endeavor. It usually takes 7 to 10 days on average, and can cost $1,500 to $30,000. You are probably wondering how one could do a bathroom renovation for $1,500? It can be easy, just change the tub, and put a tub surround in. There is the tear out with the dump run – $250 to $500, depending on how extensive the tear out is. If you replace the drywall and paint-that will cost $1,000, depending on the size of the bathroom. My advice on any bathroom renovation in Victoria BC is: don’t get the trades to do it.
