How to Kill Chickweed in the Lawn In lawn areas, pull chickweed from the ground to expose the soil. The soil should then be aerated with an aerator or shovel. If using a shovel, place gashes in the ground at least two to three inches deep and every one or two square foot. Once you do begin to water, continue to do so each day for about two to three weeks. Any leftover chickweed should begin to die while new grass replaces it. Whether you choose to eradicate chickweed manually or with an herbicide is up to you. However, the best way to kill chickweed is before it has time to set seed.
