When the carbon in  the fuel is burnt with oxygen from the atmosphere, the energy that  was used in photosynthesis is released and carbon dioxide is  re-formed.    Coal, oil, and natural gas are fossil fuel. When they are used they  are gone forever. They are called non-renewable. Fossil fuel combustion results in the emission of carbon dioxide,  which is a heat trapping greenhouse gas.    Volcanic activity releases some hundred million tons o â€¦ f CO2 into  the atmosphere each year.
