An Associates in Science degree is a two-year degree that focuses on math and science as its core curriculum. The A.S. degree differs from a Associates of Arts or Associates of Applied Science. The Associates in Science, depending on the major, can be used as a terminal degree, meaning the student does not plan to pursue a higher degree, or it can be used as the base for a four-year degree. This makes the Associate in Science degree the most flexible of the two-year degree options.
