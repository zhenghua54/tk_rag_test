Besides, the values of racking strength and shear modulus for thewall specimens with spruce boards applied horizontally was reduced to 61% and 31%, respectively, if the smaller size ofthe finish board with 0.95cm (t) Ã—8.41cm (w) was applied instead. Asindicated in Table 2, the values of racking strength for the wood-framed wall sheathed with calcium silicate panel aretwice of those wall sheathed with 12-mm thick gypsum boards, in which are commonly used for noise insulation.
