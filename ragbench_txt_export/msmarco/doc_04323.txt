Naturally, one of saffronâ€™s first uses may have been for dyeing textiles, since a single grain can color 10 gallons of water with a distinctive yellow hue. More than a grain is used, however, to color the bright orange robes worn by Buddhist priests in India. Three wispy saffron threads can be gleaned from each delicate crocus, which, ironically, is lavender-purple in color. As a spice, saffron is known for what it does to energize dishes with a pungent, earthy essence.
