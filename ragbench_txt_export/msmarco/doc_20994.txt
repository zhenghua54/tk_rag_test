Report Abuse. Bacteria don't enter cells, - that's viruses. In general: Bacteria kill and eat cells by releasing enzymes that 'digest' the cell and allow the bacteria to absorb the nutrients released. Since those enzymes destroy tissue they are poisons. The higher the number of bacteria living in the body, the greater the concentration of those poisons in the blood. I KNOW it destroys tissue causing organ failure, usually in the lungs. So DONT tell me you die by suffocating I want to know how having TB bacteria in your cells results in tissue death.
