Reasons for High Energy Use. On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated full-sized refrigerators. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features. With the number of variables that factor into appliance energy consumption, it is difficult to predict how much energy a mini fridge may use. However, there are ways to estimate energy use and cost based on the wattage ratings of appliances.
