What is EDI? Basically it is the electronic exchange of business documents in a standardized format. In the EDI world, these business documents are called transaction sets, and the customers and carriers with whom you do business are trading partners. Most trucking software packages have the ability to send and receive EDI in this format. There are two basic methods for your computer to send or receive EDI transactions with your partnerâ€™s computer: direct communication, and Value Added Network (VAN).
