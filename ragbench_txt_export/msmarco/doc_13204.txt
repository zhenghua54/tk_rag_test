Each year millions of people experience abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), which are common as we age. For most, a normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). For athletic individuals, a normal resting heart rate may be as low as 40 to 60 bpm. Abnormal heart rhythms can be described as a heart beating too fast (above 100 bpm) or slow (below 60 bpm), a fluttering sensation in the chest area or the skipping of a heart beat.
