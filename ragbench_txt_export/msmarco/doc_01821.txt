Best Answer: The gestation period is 5 weeks; after the eggs are layed, they hatch after 65-75 days. The female can lay more than one clutch of eggs, because she has the ability to retain sperm from the male. About 24 hours before they hatch, the eggs will appear to collapse. Don't breed a beardie until she is atleast 2 years old. Any time before that, and her bones might not be devoloped well enough to be able to produce & lay the eggs.
