The Continental and Pirelli brands also were at or near the top of many of the lists. A Continental tire appeared in six of the seven lists, and was the top pick in the V-rated performance all-season category (Continental PureContact). Pirelli was listed in four of the seven, but led the UHP summer tire category (Pirelli P Zero).
