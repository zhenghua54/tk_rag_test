Tweet. Tuberculosis is a disease caused by an infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus, a type of bacteria that can affect any part of the body but most commonly the lungs. The initial period of infection is known as the primary infection, which then progresses to the dormant phase (latent or inactive TB). Here the bacillus is sealed off from the healthy lung tissue in a tubercle. It can remain in this state for long periods of time.
