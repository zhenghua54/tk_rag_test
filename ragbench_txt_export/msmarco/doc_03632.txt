Yet at important moments, Albany's African Americans rose above the divisions. They did so in mid-November 1961, when the major black improvement organizations in town formed the Albany Movement and selected as their president William G. Anderson, a young black osteopath. It was the first mass movement in the modern civil rights era to have as its goal the desegregation of an entire community, and it resulted in the jailing of more than 1,000 African Americans in Albany and surrounding rural counties.
