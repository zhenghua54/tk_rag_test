In Human Anatomy and Physiology. The procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the area of the spinal column used to obtain the sample is in the lumbar spine, â€¦ or lower section of the back. I am currently a Certified Nursing Assistant and a nursing student. Caring for people is something I love and could never get tired of. I got interested in health care ever since I started my volunteer work in a emergency room at age 15.
