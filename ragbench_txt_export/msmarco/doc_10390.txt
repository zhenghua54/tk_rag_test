Of these, 5 H is the most stable, and 7 H is the least. Hydrogen is the only element whose isotopes have different names that are in common use today. The 2 H (or hydrogen-2) isotope is usually called deuterium, while the 3 H (or hydrogen-3) isotope is usually called tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of 2 H and 3 H) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium.
