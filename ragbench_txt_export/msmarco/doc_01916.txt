Operation Torch was the name of the Allied invasion of northwest Africa in the hopes and goal of removing the Axis presence on the continent. The operation marked the first time that British and American forces worked together on an invasion plan and would take place from November 8-16, 1942. For the Allies, Operation Torch was an overwhelming success. After the victory, British forces led by General Montgomery were to the east of Tunisia and the U.S. forces were located to the west effectively sandwiching Rommel in Tunisia.
