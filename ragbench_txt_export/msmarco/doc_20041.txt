Before you choose and begin cooking a pork roast it helps to understand which part of the animal it came from. The pig is divided into four primal cuts (see illustration). The tenderness or toughness of pork really depends on how much the animal has had to use the muscle. Pork is about 30 percent leaner than it was 25 years ago. This is good news for the low fat diets, but this means less flavor, moisture and tenderness, so choosing the proper cooking method for each cut will make a huge difference when preparing today's pork.
