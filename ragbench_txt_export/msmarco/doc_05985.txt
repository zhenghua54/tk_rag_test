The timing of a positive pregnancy test depends on implantation. If you are pregnant, a urine pregnancy test is not expected to be positive until 3-4 days after implantation (at the very earliest), which is about 10 days after ovulation/fertilization and 4 days before the next period. About 51% of pregnant women have a positive pregnancy test 2 days before their next expected period. A repeatedly negative pregnancy test and a missed period mean that you are not pregnant; a negative pregnancy test a week or more after your missed period indicates that your chance of being pregnant is less than 1-2%. It takes at least 2-3 days after implantation for there to be enough HCG in your system to be detected by the most sensitive test available, First Response Early Result. If you do test and it's negative, don't fret, just wait a couple more days and test again with the First Response Early Result.
