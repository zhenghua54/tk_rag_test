Biofeedback is a treatment technique in which people are trained to improve their health by using signals from their own bodies. Physical therapists use biofeedback to help stroke victims regain movement in paralyzed muscles. Psychologists use it to help tense and anxious clients learn to relax. Both patients and therapists use it to gauge and direct the progress of treatment. For patients, the biofeedback machine acts as a kind of sixth sense which allows them to see or hear activity inside their bodies. One commonly used type of machine, for example, picks up electrical signals in the muscles.
