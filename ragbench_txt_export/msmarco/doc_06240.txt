When your child shows signs of readiness, and not before. Healthy children aren't physically and emotionally ready to start using a potty until they are between 18 months and three years old. Most parents start the training when their children are between two years and three years old. But there's no official age, and you needn't potty train your toddler at all if you don't want to.
