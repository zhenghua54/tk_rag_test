Plankton are also divided into 3 main types: 1  Phytoplankton (from Greek phyton or plant), algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. 2  Zooplankton (from Greek zoon or animal), small protozoa, crustaceans, jellyfish and various other animals that feed on other plankton.
