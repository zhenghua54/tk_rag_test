Check if the auxiliary fans are working and check coolant hoses for possible leaks. A greenish or bluish fluid leak could mean a broken or worn out hose. If no leak is evident check the coolant level in the coolant reservoir. DO NOT OPEN the engine radiator cap. Fill the reservoir with water or coolant when necessary.
