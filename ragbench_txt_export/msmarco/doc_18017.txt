Muscles spasms occur: 1  As a result of the muscles trying to protect themselves from a muscle strain or sprain or. 2  In response to an underlying condition. Muscle spasms in your back can be so painful that they may have you headed for the emergency room. If you experience a back muscle spasm, make sure to stop and listen to your body. Either your back is telling you not to do that activity ever again, or it's warning you that there's a more serious underlying issue.
