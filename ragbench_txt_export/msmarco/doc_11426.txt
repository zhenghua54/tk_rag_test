AF-A is where the camera selects and goes between the last two modes. If it thinks the subject you are photographing is stationary, then it will automatically use AF-S focus mode. If it picks up that the subject you're photographing is a moving subject, then it will automatically use AF-C focus mode. This is also the default camera focus mode, unless you change the setting to AF-C or AF-S. MF is the manual focus mode. It's unclear why this focus mode is included, because nowadays there is usually an option to switch between auto and manual focus on the side of the actual lens.
