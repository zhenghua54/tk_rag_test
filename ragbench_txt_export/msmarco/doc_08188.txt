World Vision International is an Evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organization. It was founded in 1950 by Robert Pierce as a service organization to meet the emergency needs of missionaries. In 1975 development work was added to World Visions objectives. Today it is headquartered in Monrovia, California, in the same building as World Vision Inc. Mooneyham served as president of World Vision International until 1982 when he resigned after criticism within the International Board related to management style.
