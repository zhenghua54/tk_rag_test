This is how I moisturize and seal my hair so that it won't dry out. Very simple process. I try my best to avoid the ingredients: petrolatum, petroleum, lanolin, and mineral oil in my hair care products because these ingredient just coat the hair and block moisture from entering/leaving the hair. *UPDATE* (7.5.12).
