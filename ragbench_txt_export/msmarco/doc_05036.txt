Spores are the reproductive structure of the 'lower plants,' plants that don't flower. Fungi, algae, and even some bacteria all form spores when they want to pass their genes on. Plant spores are produced by the organisms we can usually recognize. The major types of plants that form spores are algae, mosses, and ferns. Algae are the simplest of these plants, and can range from tiny, single celled things to large, multi-celled plants that cover your backyard pond.
