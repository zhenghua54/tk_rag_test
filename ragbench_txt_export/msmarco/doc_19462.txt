As such, it is beneficial for the flavor to have a frost before harvesting kale. Planting at the right time will allow the plant to be of optimum picking size after frost. Baby kale leaves may be ready for harvest in as little as 25 days after planting but larger leaves will take longer. Harvesting kale for use in soups, stews and mixed greens that are cooked allows use of the larger leaves. Harvesting kale may include taking a few tender inner leaves or removing the entire bunch by cutting at the roots. Using as a garnish may take a large or small part of the kale harvest. Advertisement.
