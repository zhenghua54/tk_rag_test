Ray Kroc's 1955 McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, the ninth in the chain, was demolished in 1984, but a replica was built on the original foundation and is now described as the McDonald's USA No. 1 Store Museum. It was the second restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, prior to the involvement of Ray Kroc in the company, and it still has the two original 30-foot (9.1 m)  Golden Arches  and a 60-foot (18 m) animated neon  Speedee  sign that was added in 1959.
