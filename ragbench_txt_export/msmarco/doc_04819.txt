Best Answer: Kayaks run from a couple of hundred dollars for a cheap recreational style boat (only safe for ponds and small slow streams) to several thousand dollars for a high-end touring kayak you can safely take into the open ocean. So there really is no average cost. If you would prefer an inflatable kayak for easy portability and storage the price range is roughly $100 - $2000. With an average good quality one costing anywhere between $250 and $1000.
