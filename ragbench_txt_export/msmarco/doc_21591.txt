This montage shows the best views of Jupiter's four large and diverse Galilean satellites as seen by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) on the New Horizons spacecraft during its flyby of Jupiter in late February 2007. The four moons are, from left to right: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Most of the moons of Jupiter are small, with about 50 of the satellites being less than 6.2 miles in diameter. The number of moons changes fairly frequently, with 66 and 67 being confirmed at the end of 2011.
