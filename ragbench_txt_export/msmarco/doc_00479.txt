Holy_Morale answered: Really nothing is THAT good for making money on f2p, if you get members and do runecrafting 99, then you will end up making well over 300mil gp for it. 6 years ago 0 0. Ex-Kefiroth answered: The BEST way to make money in f2p is to man up and get your mining level to 85 so you can mine runite. (powermine iron in Al-Kharid for 32k xp per hour, this may take a few weeks). The only place you can find runite in f2p is in level 46 wilderness, northeast of the caged lesser demons. (2 rocks). Smithing is best even with 1 smithing, just smith bronze bars, also when you have 48 smithing, smith steel pl8 and sell. Wc-a nice skill to make money, only good at 60 wc. Yews are the most expensive logs, worth 350-500 ea. Runecrafting-turns out good when you can craft at least 6 air runes per ess.
