Basic adult education programs are non-degree programs that offer training for adults. Programs may prepare students to take the GED test, help them strengthen their reading levels or provide them with important life skills. Read on for more information about what is covered in basic adult education programs. Some schools offer GED training and other adult basic education online. Classes in reading, writing and mathematics can often be taken online; students with lower than ninth-grade reading or math skills are often given remote assignments to help them reach this level.
