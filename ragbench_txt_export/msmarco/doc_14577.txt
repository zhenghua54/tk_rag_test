Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents at all ages, but is mainly a disease of the elderly, with a median age of 69 years in the white US population. In the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry, 68% of patients diagnosed with AML since 1973 were over age 60 years; between 1997 and 2005, 75% was aged 60 years or more. Prognosis worsens every decade beginning at age 30 to 40.
