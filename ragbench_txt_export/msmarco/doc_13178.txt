An osteoblast is a cell that is generating new bone matrix â€” i.e., a bone forming cell. It does this by creating the organic component in bone, namely collagen. As osteoblasts move along the bone matrix, they get stuck in the tissue and turn into osteocyctes. This creates new bone growth and repair. There are three types of bone cells in bone marrow. Unless you have a fracture or a disease like osteoporosis, your physician may never talk about osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes.
