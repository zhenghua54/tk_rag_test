Anonymous says: 1. I don’t think companies should be able to patent human genes. Letting private companies patent human genes makes it harder to find cures—researchers are often fearful to research something that has a chance of being in the private domain. I think companies shouldn’t be able to patent human genes. First of all its your genes, your cells you own that. Companies shouldn’t just take something from you without your consent of it.
