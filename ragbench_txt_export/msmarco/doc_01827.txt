The accelerated possession procedure enables landlords to bypass the usual Court hearing and, assuming the paperwork is correct, it is usually possible to obtain an Accelerated Possession Order demanding that the tenant vacate the property within a period set by the Court which is usually 14 days. The possession order will normally take effect two weeks after the decision unless the court decides that this would cause the tenant exceptional hardship. In that case, the judge may delay the order for up to six weeks.
