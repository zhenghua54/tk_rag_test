PepsiCo anticipated the increasing focus on health and wellness more than 15 years ago and continues to innovate to provide consumers with a wide variety of choices. Reduce the average amount of saturated fats per serving in key global food brands, in key countries, by 15 percent by 2020, against a 2006 baseline. In 2009, PepsiCo established ambitious targets for the reduction of sodium, saturated fats and added sugars in our key global brands. We remain steadfastly committed to these goals and believe we will ultimately achieve them despite some challenges affecting our rates of progress.
