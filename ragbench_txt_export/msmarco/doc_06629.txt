Degrees in Chiropractic. To become a chiropractor, one must earn a degree from an accredited school and become licensed by the state in which they wish to practice. Many states also require continuing education credits for chiropractors to maintain licensure. Chiropractors earn the doctor of chiropractic degree, or DC. Programs generally last between three and five years and students almost always are required to have a bachelor degree with an emphasis on science courses.
