Notes. 1  If you have an audio receiver that has optical audio input, connect your optical audio cable to the HDMI Audio Adapter (by using a TOSLINK connector). 2  The Xbox 360 S Console features a TOSLINK input jack on the back of the console. 3  In this case, you do not have to use the audio adapter for digital audio. Description. The Xbox 360 HDMI Cable connects the Xbox 360 console to a high-definition TV that is equipped with an HDMI port. The HDMI cable can be used only on an Xbox 360 console that is equipped with an HDMI port. Note HDMI cables that are not produced by Microsoft will work with an HDMI-equipped Xbox 360 console.
