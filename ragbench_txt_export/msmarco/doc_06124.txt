More commonly known as false teeth, dentures are fitted in place of natural teeth. A full set is used to replace all your teeth. A part set is used to replace one or more missing teeth. Dentures are custom-made using impressions (mouldings) from your gums. They're usually made from metal or plastic. You can use implants to replace just a single tooth or several teeth. To fit an implant, titanium screws are drilled into the jaw bone to support a crown, bridge or denture. Replacement parts take time to prepare. This is to ensure that they fit your mouth and other teeth properly.
