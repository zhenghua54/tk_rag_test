Hello, We rent an apartment in an 80 unit building in Ottawa and the heat is not on. Last year it wasn't turned on until October 15. There is a frost warning right now and tonight is forecasted for zero degrees. I have had the oven on since 7am the last 3 days, and turn it off at 5pm. If a landlord fails to provide heat in accordance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act and the Regulations, a tenant may file an application to the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board to have the Board determine what the appropriate remedy is.
