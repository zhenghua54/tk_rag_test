Stop 1: The Mouth. The mouth is the beginning of the digestive system, and, in fact, digestion starts here before you even take the first bite of a meal. The smell of food triggers the salivary glands in your mouth to secrete saliva, causing your mouth to water. When you actually taste the food, saliva increases. In addition, juices are produced that will help to further break down food. Chew your food more -- it helps with your digestion. Stop 2: The Pharynx and Esophagus. Also called the throat, the pharynx is the portion of the digestive tract that receives the food from your mouth. Branching off the pharynx is the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach, and the trachea or windpipe, which carries air to the lungs. 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
