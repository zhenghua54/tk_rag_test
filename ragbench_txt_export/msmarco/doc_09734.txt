Married couples (or engaged couples) cannot be “au pairs”. Au pair positions in the USA are for one person at a time. Even host families that need two au pairs at the same time don’t look for married or partnered ‘couples’, since the family has two au pairs usually to cover a work week that is more than 45 hours long.
