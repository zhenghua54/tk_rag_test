The Schieffen Plan was Germany's key war plan for invading France at the start of World War 1. It involved marching through Belgium in order to knock France out of the war quickly. The plan was devised by Alfred von Schlieffen. It involved attacking France through Belgium in the event of war with France. The Schlieffen Plan (in World War I) was named for its author, the German army chief of staff Count Alfred von Schlieffen, who formulated it in 1905.
