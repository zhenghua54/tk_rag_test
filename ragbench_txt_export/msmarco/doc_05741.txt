Occasionally, the placenta of another puppy will come out with a preceding puppy. As the puppy exits the mother, she will lick the puppy clean and may eat the placenta and sac. This is normal behavior and an integral part of the bonding process. During a dog birth, puppies can take up to four hours to appear.
