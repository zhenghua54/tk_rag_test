Method: Add cut potatoes to large bowl and cover with warm water. Allow to soak for 20 minutes as you preheat your oven to 475Â°F. Drain the potatoes, pat dry and toss in oil to coat. Season and bake for 10-15 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through. Turn the fries and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until golden brown. Results: These produced nice, crispy french fires, but they were also a bit time consuming with all the soaking, drying and then baking again.
