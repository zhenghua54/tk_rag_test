Prasiolite (or vermarine) is the name for any quartz crystal or cluster that is green in color. Although often cut as a gemstone, prasiolite is actually quite rare in nature. Most prasiolites on the market are heat treated amethyst. Note that prasiolite is macro-crystalline quartz. A green cryptocrystalline quartz, where the individual crystals are too small to be seen and the resulting transparency is translucent, would be called chrysoprase. The term prase is sometimes used for any leek-green color of quartz, whether macro-or cryptocrystalline.
