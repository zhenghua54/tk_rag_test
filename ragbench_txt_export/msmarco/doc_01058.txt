There are numerous symptoms of Graves’ disease—an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to over-produce thyroid hormone, which is known as hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, so some Graves’ disease symptoms are the same as hyperthyroidism symptoms. However, people with Graves’ disease may also have other symptoms not related to hyperthyroidism. It can be a challenge to detect Graves’ disease early on.
