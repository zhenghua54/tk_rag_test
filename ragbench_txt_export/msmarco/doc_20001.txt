A general rule of thumb for most (not all) chemical reactions is that the rate at which the reaction proceeds will approximately double for each 10Â°C increase in temperature. For solids, the shape and size of the reactants makes a big difference in the reaction rate. Presence of Catalysts and Competitors. Catalysts (e.g., enzymes) lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction and increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process.
