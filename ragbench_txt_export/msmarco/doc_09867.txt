Because Golden Living is always searching for professional, quality staff, we offer the Certified and State Registered Nursing Assistant Training Program at our special Golden Living Training Centers in California, Indiana, Missouri and Kentucky. All of your time spent in the Golden LivingCenter will be instructor-led, and you will get the opportunity to experience what it is like to care for patients. Classes are normally full-time, five days a week from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm.
