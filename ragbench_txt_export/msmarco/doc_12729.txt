Let’s clear the air about how long it takes to be a nurse. When we think of a nurse, we think of one who cares for his/her patients and can administer medicine to them. This is a registered nurse — an RN; it is the standard. The standard college education for a registered nurse is two years in time. Other options than the 2 year degree. You have other options, too. Rather than getting an associate’s degree, you could opt to go to a school that offers bachelor degrees, which requires four years. The BSN track is probably the best option for high school students.
