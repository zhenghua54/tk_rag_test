Acupuncture and acupressure both use the same meridians and points in their healing, the difference is that acupuncture uses needles while acupressure uses both soft and firm touches on the points to generate the flow of energy. Qi Gong is somewhat different. Their flow is as critical as the flow of blood; your life and health depend on both. Meridians of the body affect all major systems including: immune, nervous, endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, skeletal, muscular and the lymphatic system.
