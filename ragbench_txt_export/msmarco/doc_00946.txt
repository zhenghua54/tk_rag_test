Description. Most plants have a vascular design. Vascular plants are those which have tubes called xylem or phloem inside of them for the transport of liquid. Plants which have roots, stems and leaves are vascular. Nonvascular plants do not have tubes inside and must move water through them in a different manner. Examples of vascular plants would be trees, vegetable plants, grass and anything with flowers. Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Very few kinds of vascular plants are seedless. Instead they produce spores for the purpose of regeneration. Nonvascular plants do not produce fruit or generate seeds. They also produce spores for reproduction, which is a complicated process.
