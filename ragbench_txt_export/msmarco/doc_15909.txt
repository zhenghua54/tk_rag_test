Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), and its weaker security level is discussed here. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol for wireless networks that encrypts transmitted data. The disadvantage is that without any security, your data can be intercepted without difficulty. If you run a network with only the default security, where WEP is turned off, any of your neighbors can immediately log on to your network and use your Internet connection. 1  For wireless devices to communicate, all of them must use the same WEP setting.
