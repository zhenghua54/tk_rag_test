Report Abuse. I'm surprised that you were not given x-rays of your ribs to make sure (if broken) they are not puncturing anything else. Broken and/or cracked ribs take about 6 weeks to heal, just as any other bone that may be broken. Decoy Duck Â· 8 years ago. If you would have had difficulty, the x-ray would be used to see if the fractured rib, punchered a lung..... As for how long will it take..... the pain should start subsiding after the 1st week.....
