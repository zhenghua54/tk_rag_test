11%. Employment of construction and building inspectors is projected to grow 12 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Concern for public safety and a desire to improve the quality of construction should continue to increase demand for inspectors. The median annual wage for construction and building inspectors was $53,450 in May 2012. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,050, and the top 10 percent earned more than $83,760.
