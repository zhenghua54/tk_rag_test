From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A death-qualified jury is a jury in a criminal law case in the United States in which the death penalty is a prospective sentence. Such a jury will be composed of jurors who: 1  Are not categorically opposed to the imposition of capital punishment; 2  Are not of the belief that the death penalty must be imposed in all instances of capital murderâ€”that is, they would consider life imprisonment as a possible penalty.
