Ketel One is a delicious Vodka. No hash burn, a pleasant taste. I usually make Vodka mixed drinks with juice etc, at a half to half ratio, with K1 I can make a drink 3/4 to 1/4 juice and the taste is smooth refined and refreshing, no burning aftertaste. Ingredients. Ketel One is distilled from fermented Wheat. Wheat vodkas are popular in the Eastern European Vodka Belt countries. Wheat is one of the most popular ingredients in grain based vodkas and generally produces a smooth and fruity spirit.
