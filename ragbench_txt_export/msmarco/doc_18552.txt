Scleral lens, with visible outer edge resting on the sclera of a patient with chronic severe dry eye syndrome. Modern scleral lenses are made of a highly oxygen permeable polymer. They are unique in their design in that they fit onto and are supported by the sclera, the white portion of the eye. A scleral lens is a prototypical lens dating back to the early 1880s. Originally these lenses were designed by using a substance to take a mold of the eye. Lenses would then be shaped to conform to the mold, initially using blown glass and then ground glass in the 1920s and polymethyl methacrylate in the 1940s.
