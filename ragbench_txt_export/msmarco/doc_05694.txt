Automatic Fly Reel. The third type of fly reel retrieve system, the automatic fly reel retrieve, does just what the name suggests. The reel retrieves all fly line without the angler turning the spool at all. The fly reel, instead of having a spool which is then turned by a handle, instead has a trigger. When released, the trigger allows the fly line to zip back into the reel. This isn't needed, or actually wanted, when fly fishing for most freshwater fish-particularly when fishing on rivers. 1 Get a single retrieve fly reel (the most common). 2  Don't get an automatic or multiplying retrieve, which are nice for saltwater fishing but not for freshwater fly fishing. 3  Make sure, repeat, make sure that you match up the fly line weight with the fly reel weight.
