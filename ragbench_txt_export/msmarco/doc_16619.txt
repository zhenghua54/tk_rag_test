Fibers include steel fibers, glass fibers, synthetic fibers and natural fibers â€“ each of which lend varying properties to the concrete. In addition, the character of fiber-reinforced concrete changes with varying concretes, fiber materials, geometries, distribution, orientation, and densities. The concept of using fibers as reinforcement is not new. Fibers have been used as reinforcement since ancient times. Historically, horsehair was used in mortar and straw in mud bricks. In the 1900s, asbestos fibers were used in concrete.
