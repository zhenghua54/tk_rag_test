This is copied to the mRNA first. The differences between DNA and RNA are that 1) RNA has uracil in place of thymine and 2) RNA uses ribose instead of the 2-deoxyribose in DNA. There are both double stranded and single stranded DNA and RNA in nature so this is not a defining difference. The difference between DNA and a chromosome has to deal with an intermediary-genes. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, which is a nucleic acid. It is made up of four bases-adenin â€¦ e, cytosine, guanine and thymine. When these four bases are arranged in a segment, it is called a gene.
