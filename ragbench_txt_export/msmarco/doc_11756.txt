A burial vault is a lined and sealed outer receptacle that houses the casket. It protects the casket from the weight of the earth and heavy maintenance equipment that will pass over the grave. It also helps resist water and preserves the beauty of the cemetery or memorial park by preventing the ground from settling. Wilbert offers three categories of burial vaults, with differences in the level of protection, warrantees, beauty, and personalization options.
