Hiccups at any time can be aggravating, but pregnancy and hiccups seem to go hand in hand. Even though they are not necessarily a symptom of pregnancy, or even a common complaint, it does appear that women are more susceptible to getting them while they are pregnant. This can cause the hiccups to form. You can also get hiccups from acid reflux, which tends to be stronger during pregnancy. The acid reflux can also result in the heartburn that you might be feeling, too. Although you might not necessarily feel the acid, the reflux can still cause the hiccups.
