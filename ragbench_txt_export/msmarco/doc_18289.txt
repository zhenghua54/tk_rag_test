There are about 250 calories in a small grilled cheese sandwich. Each slice of white bread has about 50 calories in it and each slice of American cheese has about 67 calories in it. So that 167 right there. But usually a grilled cheese sandwich will have two slices of cheese... so that puts you at 234. In addition, butter used for cooking, you are looking at about 300 calories overall for a thin grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese ALONE is going to be about 200 calories if you use say 2-3 slices of American cheddar. Then there is the question of buttering the bread and if you do butter the bread how much butter will you use. You are looking at a minimum of 250 calories in a thin grilled cheese sandwich. It depends on the type of cheese, bread and butter (or margarine).
