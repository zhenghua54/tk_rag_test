Scribd. Last on my list, Scribd is very similar to Oyster, but with a few unique features. It has a catalog of more than 500,000 books that you can borrow for just $9 per month, one dollar cheaper than Kindle Unlimited and Oyster. E-book subscription services are all the rage this year, thanks in part to Amazon. The decades-old book retailer unveiled its own unlimited book subscription, Kindle Unlimited, on July 18, aiming to compete with Oyster and Scribd, comparable services that have been around since 2012.
