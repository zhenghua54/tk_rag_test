For an aspiring pilot to spend 40 hours flying would cost $2,760 for the smaller plane or $4,360 for the larger one. However, while some pilots become proficient in as few as 40 hours, student pilots normally average closer to 70 hours of flight time before they are good enough to pass a pilot's licensing test.
