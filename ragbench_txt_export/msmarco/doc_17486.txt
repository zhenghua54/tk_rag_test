The short answer: 20 (composite score) is the national ACT average. About half of students score above that, and half of students score below. The top 25% of ACT takers score about 24 or more, so if your score is above 24, that's excellent. The bottom 25% of ACT takers score 16 or less -- so if you're scoring in that range, be careful!
