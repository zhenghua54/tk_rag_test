Best Answer: a) Plant cells contain large central vacuole, chloroplasts (if it is a photosynthetic plant cell) and a cellulose cell wall not found in animal cells. b) Eukaryotic cells have their chromosomes (DNA) contained in a nucleus, prokaryotic cells don't. `Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, bound by a double membrane. Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus. The purpose of the nucleus is to sequester the DNA-related functions of the big eukaryotic cell into a smaller chamber, for the purpose of increased efficiency.
