The RDFI may require that written confirmation of a verbal stop payment order be made within 14 days of a verbal stop payment order, provided that the RDFI notifies the Receiver of this requirement and provides an address to which the written confirmation should be sent at the time the verbal order is provided. The RDFI is obligated to comply with a verbal stop payment order only for a period of fourteen calendar days unless the order is confirmed in writing within that 14 -day period. A written stop payment order is effective for six months unless it is renewed in writing.
