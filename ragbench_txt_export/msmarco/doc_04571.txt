This test measures a substance called parathyroid hormone (PTH) in your blood. PTH is made by four tiny parathyroid glands in your neck. PTH circulates in your blood and is needed to regulate the level of calcium in your blood. Your heart, bones, nervous system, and kidneys need a normal calcium level in the blood to work the way they should. If your calcium level is too low, your parathyroid glands release PTH to get more calcium into your blood. If your calcium level is too high, your parathyroid glands stop producing PTH. Measuring the amount of PTH in your blood helps your healthcare provider find out the cause of an abnormal calcium level
