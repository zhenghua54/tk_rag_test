It has everything to do with age. Normally, a person's IQ should be at 100, at average. But, say, if a 6 year old got 100, they would be considered smarter than an Adult who got 100. This is because an adult should know more than a 6 year old. So, for a 12 year old, 100-110 would be average, and anything above that is above average.
