what s new is that any qualified dividends and long term capital gains that fall in the new 39 6 % tax bracket which kicks in when your taxable income is above $ 400000 if single and $ 450000 if married filing jointly will be taxed at a 20 % rate if your modified adjusted gross income is above $ 200000 $ 250000 if married filing jointly your total marginal tax rate for qualified dividends and long term capital gains is probably 18 8 % or 23 8 % rather than just 15 % as it has been for the last several years
