Milky quartz, polycrystalline quartz grains, and quartz with undulatory extinction are less stable in the sedimentary environment than monocrystalline non-undulatory quartz. Thus, a sandstone consisting of monocrystalline quartz that does not show undulatory extinction is mineralogically the most mature. 1  Feldspar. 1 Although feldspars are the most common minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks, feldspars are less stable than quartz at conditions near the Earth's surface. 2  Thus feldspars make up only 10-15% of all sandstones. 3  Feldspars in sandstones consist of the following:
