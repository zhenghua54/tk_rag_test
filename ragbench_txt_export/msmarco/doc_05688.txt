What Miso Paste Is. Basically, it's a paste made from a mixture of soy beans, rice or barley that has been fermented with salt, water and a fungus. But don't get alarmed -- it's not as gross as it sounds. Miso is a cornerstone of Japanese cuisine and it's been so for centuries. Use miso paste to glaze meat, fish or even vegetables. Once it's mixed with oil, vinegar, soy sauce or other condiments, simply brush the glaze mixture onto the protein or vegetables and you're ready to grill or broil.
