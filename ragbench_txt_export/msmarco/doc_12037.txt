To find information on a specific area code, use the area code lookup that makes it easy to find an area code by number and gives detailed information including city/state, timezone, and area code maps. The next three digits of a landline number or cellphone number are called the NXX. The NXX is also known as the prefix or exchange. Various telephone carriers will reserve blocks of telephone numbers by reserving an NXX within an area code. Like area codes, not all prefixes are currently in use.
