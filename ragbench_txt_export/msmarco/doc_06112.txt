What is an angiosperm? Angiosperms (a plant whose ovules are enclosed in an ovary) are  commonly referred to as flowering plants, as opposed to  Gymnosperms, or cone bearing plants. Stamens are separated into anthers, which produce pollen, and filaments. The mature ovary (part of the pistil containing the seeds) is termed a fruit.. Sepals and petals may be showy and colorful to attract pollinators, or may be quite reduced in wind-pollinated plants, such as grasses.
