Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a computer-based method for collecting, managing, analyzing, modeling, and presenting geographic or spatial data. GIS software allows you to overlay maps and datasets and query them in terms of their spatial relationships to each other. Employment of GIS specialists and cartographers is projected to grow 20 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is faster than average across all occupations. However, since it's a small field to start with, this growth will only create about 2,400 new jobs during that period.
