Lal Kitab is one of the branches of Vedic Astrology like KP System, Jaimini Astrology, Tajik Astrology, Nadi Astrology etc. I mean you can judge a kundli (birth chart) using various different methods and Lal Kitab is one of them. Lal Kitab method of birth chart assessment has been developed by Late Pt. Roop Chand Joshi. The language used in Lal Kitab is Urdu/Hindi popular during 1939-1952 period and written in Urdu script (Nastaliq). The language of the book makes it difficult to understand and that is the reason there are not many astrologers who understand Lal Kitab.
