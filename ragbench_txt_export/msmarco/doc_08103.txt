What is cystic acne? Cystic acne is a form of acne and it's the most severe form of acne. It's where you have large cysts or nodules that can occur anywhere on the face, the neck, the back, the chest and it can be very disturbing. Many times cystic acne can scar, so it's very important if you have cystic acne to see a dermatologist immediately. It's one of the forms of acne that cannot be treated with over-the-counter preparations because the acne really goes deep in the skin and it requires internal medication to treat it appropriately.
