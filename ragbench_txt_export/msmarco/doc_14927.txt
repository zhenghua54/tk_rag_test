2) A cDNA library will not contain a clone of every gene of the organism. A genomic library could have a clone of every gene for that organism.. 3) If a gene is expressed at a high level in certain tissues, a cDNA library made from mRNA of that tissue will contain many copies of that gene. Other clones will rarely or never be found in a cDNA library because the gene is not expressed or is rarely expressed. The “c” in cDNA stands for copy because a double stranded DNA copy is made from a mRNA. Because of the different starting material, cDNA libraries will have some key distinctions from a genomic library. The reasons for the differences above are because of the nature of gene expression.
