The least expensive way to get everything you need to hang your driveway gate is to buy it in kit form. A complete kit, including two gates, two posts and hardware can cost under $1,000. DIY automatic kits made from aluminium start at about $1700 and go up to $4000 or more for wide telescoping kits.
