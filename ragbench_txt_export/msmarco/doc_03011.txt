Substance monism is the philosophical view that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance. Another definition states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them (e.g. in Neoplatonism everything is derived from The One). 1 Partial monism, within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance. 2  Existence monism, the view that there is only one concrete object token (The One, τὸ ἕν or the Monad).
