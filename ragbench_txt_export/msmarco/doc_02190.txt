Narcotic Analgesics for IBS are opioid drugs and can be highly effective painkillers. One of their chief side effects, constipation, is actually of benefit to some Irritable Bowel Syndrome sufferers. Typically, most patients are initially prescribed an anti-spasmodic drug upon diagnosis, though you may have received a low-dose antidepressant or anti-diarrheal instead, or even one of the newest (and thus potentially riskiest) Irritable Bowel Syndrome drugs, Zelnorm or Lotronex.
