Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is the most common cause of pancreas symptoms. Common causes of pancreatitis include gallstones that form in the nearby gallbladder and travel to the pancreas via the common bile duct; long-term, heavy alcohol use; and certain conditions such as cystic fibrosis.
