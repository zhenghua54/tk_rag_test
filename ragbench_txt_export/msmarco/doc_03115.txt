Alternatively known as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, lupus anticoagulant syndrome is a coagulation disorder which causes formation of thrombosis in blood vessels. In very uncommon circumstances, lupus anticoagulant syndrome causes a person to develop rapid organ failure as a result of generalized thrombosis. This stage of condition is referred as catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
