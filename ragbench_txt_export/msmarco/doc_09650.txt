Learn about the signs and symptoms of early-onset Parkinson’s and who is most at risk. More than 1.5 million Americans have Parkinson’s disease, and each year 50,000 more individuals are diagnosed with the condition. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, five to 10 percent of the 50,000 are under the age of 50. (The average age for Parkinson’s diagnosis is 60.) These patients have what’s known as “early-onset” or young Parkinson’s disease. However, most people diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s disease (and Parkinson’s disease in general) have no family history or obvious risk factors. Researchers believe a combination of factors—both hereditary and environmental—combine to increase a person’s chance of developing the degenerative disease.
