Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are triglycerides whose fatty acids have an aliphatic tail of 6â€“12 carbon atoms. The fatty acids found in MCTs are called medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Like all triglycerides, MCTs are composed of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids. In the case of MCTs, 2 or 3 of the fatty acid chains attached to glycerol are medium-chain in length. Rich sources for commercial extraction of beneficial MCTs include palm kernel oil and coconut oil.
