Let's try this problem. We have a pea plant that is heterozygous for two traits â€” height and seed color. The plant is tall and yellow, which are the dominant phenotypes. We will let this plant self-fertilize, and see what kind of offspring this plant produces. This is a dihybrid cross; we are tracking two traits. We will use T (tall) to denote height and Y (yellow) to denote seed color. The plant is heterozygous for both traits so the plant is TtYy. The first thing to do is determine the types of gametes this plant produces
