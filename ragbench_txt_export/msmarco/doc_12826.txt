Psyllium Fiber. Psyllium fiber is derived from the husk of the seeds of the plant. It is highly soluble in water and forms mucilage, which acts as a laxative purely due to the mechanical effects the fiber bulk produces in the large intestine. Psyllium slows the passage of stools in the colon, so it is helpful in the treatment of diarrhea. Intake of limited quantities of psyllium has been found to be useful in inflammatory bowel disease, or IBS, but you need to work closely with your doctor to determine the amount of fiber right for you.
