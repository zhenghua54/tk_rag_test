For a stool analysis, a stool sample is collected in a clean container and then sent to the laboratory. Laboratory analysis includes microscopic examination, chemical tests, and microbiologic tests. The stool will be checked for color, consistency, amount, shape, odor, and the presence of mucus. 1 Check for poor absorption of nutrients by the digestive tract (malabsorption syndrome). 2  For this test, all stool is collected over a 72-hour period and then checked for fat (and sometimes for meat fibers). 3  This test is called a 72-hour stool collection or quantitative fecal fat test.
