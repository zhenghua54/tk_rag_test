Creep vs. Stretch: A review of viscoelastic properties of skin. Ann Plast Surg. 1998; 41:215-219. “A property common to extensible soft tissues is that they become stiffer as they are extended due to the reorientation of collagen fibers. “It was concluded that sustained static or cyclic loading of lumbar viscoelastic tissues may cause micro-damage in the collagen structure, which in turn reflexively elicit spasms in the multifidus as well as hyperexcitability early in the recovery when the majority of the creep recovers.
