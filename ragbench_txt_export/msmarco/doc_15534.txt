I get mouth ulcers constantly, I've had one for nearly 2 weeks but it's on tip of my tongue so I think it's just getting irritated. I get them on side of my tongue to like when my tongue feels swollen, I have Undersctive thyroid. Easophogus us and ulcer on it. But always suffered with mouth ulcers. I've had an ulcer at the bottom of my gum on the left hand side, its white grey and red, my lip gets rather inflamed and leaves a redish rash kind of thing around it, its so uncomfortable it bares me to eat or drink. I've been using bonjela for 2weeks now and all it does is numbs it for 5seconds.
