Posting to a Google Plus Community. As a member of a community you can post into that community either from your profile, from within the community itself, from the ‘Share’ button in the upper right, from a Google+ Page that is a member of the community etc. Sometimes you may want to restrict information being ‘shared’ onwards through Google Plus. To do this by clicking on the drop down in the upper corner of a post…. Also, as you can see from the drop down, you can edit, delete, link to the post and even disable comments as well.
