Timer. The Oster TSSTTVMNDG toaster oven has a 90 min ute timer that turns off the oven automatically when it gets to zero. You can change the cooking time, up to 90 minutes, for BAKE, BROIL, CONVECTION BAKE, WARM, DEFROST, and PIZZA. I am surprised that Oster allows 90 minutes for the BROIL setting. Many other toaster ovens have a much shorter maximum cooking time for the BROIL setting because it gets very hot inside.
