You're on the right track if you plan to lose weight by eating mainly fruits, vegetables and lean proteins for the next month. Fad diets won't provide you with the weight-loss results you want; instead, you need to make permanent changes in what you eat to lose weight and keep it off. Still, you'll need to count calories and consume fewer of them. To lose 4 to 5 lbs. in one month, you should consume about 500 to 600 fewer calories each day than you would if you weren't trying to lose weight.
