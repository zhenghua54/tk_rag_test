Work with the calendar. If you're lucky, you'll be able to time your exit from your old job and the start of your new job so that you are not without health insurance for more than 90 days, says Andrea Kinkade, president and benefits advisor at Kaminsky & Associates Inc. in Maumee, Ohio. Under Obamacare, employees must be eligible to enroll in their employer's health insurance within 90 days of their start date. It could be less. In California, our state legislature passed a law to say it's 60 days instead of 90, says Peter Freska, a benefits consultant with The LBL Group in Los Alamitos.
