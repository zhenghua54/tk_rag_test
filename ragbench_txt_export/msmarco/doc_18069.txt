After each legislative election the party that wins the most representatives is designated the  majority  in each house, and the other party is called the  minority .. These designations are significant because the majority party holds the most significant leadership positions, such as Speaker of the House. The majority leader usually the second ranking member of the majority party, is the party leader on the floor. Often hand-picked by the Speaker, the majority leader helps plan the party's legislative program. Many Speakers came to their positions by serving as majority leader first.
