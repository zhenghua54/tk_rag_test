Although vitamin D may help with weight loss, it is not recommended to take excessive vitamin D in an attempt to lose those extra pounds. Because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin stored in the fat cells, high doses may lead to toxicity. The upper limit of vitamin D is 4,000 IUs. Signs of vitamin D toxicity include nausea, vomiting and weakness. As with most vitamins, more is not always better.
