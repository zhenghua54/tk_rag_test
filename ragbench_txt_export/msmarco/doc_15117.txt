Myosin cross-bridges remain in place until the myosin head binds an ATP molecule. In the resting state, a myosin head is bound to an ADP and a phosphate molecule that have been produced by splitting an ATP molecule. When Ca2+ binds to a myosin head, it triggers the formation of a cross-bridge between myosin and actin. A troponin molecule that binds a calcium ion weakens its connection to a G actin molecule. When Ca2+ binds to a myosin head, it triggers the formation of a cross-bridge between myosin and actin.
