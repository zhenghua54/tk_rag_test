6. One of the BEST ways to increase carbonation in your Kombucha is to use small bottles with a latch/sealed top. You can buy these specifically made for kombucha or homeage alcoholic beverages. Using these will almost certainly ensure you will have strong fizz in your kombucha after a second ferment. While most people focus on adding carbonation during secondary fermentation of kombucha you can also adjust the way you do the first fermentation to boost the overall bubbliness of your kombucha tea, whether you do a second ferment or not.
