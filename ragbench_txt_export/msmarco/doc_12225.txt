Under Roth IRA rules (check IRS Publication 590 for more information), you can withdraw up to $5,000 without paying taxes on it, and without paying a penalty. Once you dip into your earnings – that $272.50 – the story changes. You can withdraw what you have contributed at anytime, and for any reason. So, if you have contributed $5,000 a year faithfully for the last three years, you now have $15,000 available to you from your Roth IRA. Why a Roth IRA Makes an Attractive Emergency Fund.
