The coggins test tests for EIA, or Equine Infectious Anemia. It is a viral disease that is HIGHLY contagious. Although often infected horses do not die, they will remain carriers, and must be isolated for the rest of their life. There is no cure. In a coggins test they draw some blood to test for EIA. It is required at basically every recognized show, in many states to transport, and most barns will require you present it. Around here it costs $20-$40, but I would assume that varies by region.
