Bone is a connective tissue, composed of a solid extracellular matrix and cells, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The suffixes of our two words are different, though. “Blasts” means embryonic — a condition related to an early stage of development. There are three types of bone cells in bone marrow. Unless you have a fracture or a disease like osteoporosis, your physician may never talk about osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes.
