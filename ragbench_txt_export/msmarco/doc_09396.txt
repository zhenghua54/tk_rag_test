In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to the study of the motion of all gases, not limited to air.
