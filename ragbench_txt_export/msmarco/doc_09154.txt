Epiglottitis is an inflammation of the epiglottis â€” the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the trachea (windpipe). Epiglottitis involves bacterial infection of the epiglottis, most often caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B, although some cases are attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
