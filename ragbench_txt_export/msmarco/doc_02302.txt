galvanizing. Process in which a zinc film is deposited on goods made of steel to provide long term (generally 10 to 30 years) corrosion protection and abrasion resistance.wo common galvanizing processes are (1) Hot metal bath: about 250 years old but still popular method in which the item is immersed in molten zinc to deposit a 50 to 150 micron thick film. (2) Electro-deposition: more recent method in which a 5 to 30 micron thick film of zinc is deposited electrochemically.
