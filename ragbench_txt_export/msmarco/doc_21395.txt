On September 15, 1971, the newly founded Don't Make a Wave Committee sent a chartered ship, Phyllis Cormack, renamed Greenpeace for the protest, from Vancouver to oppose United States testing of nuclear devices in Amchitka, Alaska. Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization. Greenpeace evolved from the peace movement and anti-nuclear protests â€¦ in Vancouver, British Columbia, in the early 1970s.
