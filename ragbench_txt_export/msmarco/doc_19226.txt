Monomer-Monosaccharide ex: glucose, fructose, galactose Polymers-disaccharides and polysaccharides Two monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkage are disaccharides. Monosacharides are categorized as triose,tetrose,pentose,hexose. according to the number of carbon atoms availability. if the monosacharide contain, 3 carbon-triose-eg. Glyceralthehyde 4 carbon-tetrose-eg.erythrose 5 carbon-pentose-eg. ribose,rebulose 6 carbon-hexose-eg. glucose,fructose,galactose.
