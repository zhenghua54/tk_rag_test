Basically, trans fat content only needs to be listed if the food contains 0.5 grams or more of it per serving. What that means is, if a food contains 0.49 grams of trans fat in 1 serving, that food will have Trans Fat: 0 grams listed in its nutrition facts. This is when the hilarity ensues. 1  First, few people ever eat 1 serving of anything. 1 So, as if it wasn't bad enough that foods can have Trans Fat: 0 grams on their label even though the food actually contains it, many of these foods take it even further by bringing extra attention this fact/lie and turn it into another selling point of the food.
