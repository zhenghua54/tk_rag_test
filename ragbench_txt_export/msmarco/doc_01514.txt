The father provides an X or Y chromosome; the mother always provides an X chromosome. Therefore, the sex of the child is determined by the chromosome of the individual sperm that fertilizes the egg. Male offspring carry XY chromosomes; female offspring carry XX chromosomes. In humans, it is the sperm which determines the sex of the child. The presence of a Y chromosome in the zygote is what determines that the child will be male. Only the fathe â€¦ r has a Y chromosome (XY).
