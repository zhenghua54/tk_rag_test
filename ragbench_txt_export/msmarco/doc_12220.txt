Roth IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA may be withdrawn tax-free at any time – it is a return of already taxed principle. Roth conversions – if you convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, you will pay income taxes based on the converted amount. Also, there is a five-year “seasoning” period. Exactly like the traditional IRA, the maximum contribution limits for a Roth IRA are the same. For the year 2012, contributions cannot exceed $5000, if you are below 50. Participants above 50 can contribute an extra $1000 (catch-up contribution).
