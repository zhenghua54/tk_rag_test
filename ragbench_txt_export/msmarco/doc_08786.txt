Best Answer: Sadhu and Sannyasi! Sadhu in Sanskrit, basically means; to cut or one who cuts... The one by whose instruction or direction one can be cut free from samsara, the cycle of repeated birth and death. A sadhu can be in any order of life. A sannyasi for the first few years of his sannyasa life will carry a sannyasa danda or staff. According to the type of staff he carries you can tell which line or school of philosophy he hails from. Mayavadi sannyasis carry a single rod, known as an eka danda.
