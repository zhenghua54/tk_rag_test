Typically gas or electric, this type of box smoker is nothing more than a burner or heating element inside a metal box that you can put meat in with wood chips held over the heat to smolder. A little breeze or a light rain and these smokers lose heat. The Brinkmann, for instance, retails for around $85USD. At the top range of the vertical water, smokers is the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (referred to online as the WSM). Available in two sizes, 18.5 inch for around $350USD and the largest of the vertical water smokers, the 22.5 inch which sells around $500USD.
