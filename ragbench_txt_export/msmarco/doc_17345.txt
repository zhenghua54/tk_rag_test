In ballet and other dance forms, arabesque is a position where the body is supported on one leg, with the other leg extended directly behind the body with a straight knee. The standing leg can be straight or in plie, but the back leg must always be straight. Arabesque has several different versions, all defined by the position of the dancerâ€™s arms. The one constant is that the dancer must have a straight leg directly behind them, or it is not an arabesque.
