If you prune in the spring, you will lose all of that year’s bloom. Old Garden Roses can be pruned to 15 inches every other year without damage. This keeps a large bush within bounds and provides shaping. For most roses, spring pruning should reduce the overall height of the bush to 18-24.. The shorter you prune – the fewer blooms you will have, but generally these blooms will be larger. Leaving taller canes will produce smaller blooms in more abundance.
