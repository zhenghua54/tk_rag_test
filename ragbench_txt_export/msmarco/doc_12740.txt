Fire TV is Amazon's answer to the Apple TV, and to other options like the Roku 3 and the Google Chromecast. Fire TV brings Amazon Instant Video, Showtime Anytime, and tons of games to your big screen TV. The Amazon Fire TV seems pretty cool, but it seems like you really need to purchase Amazon Prime to make it worthwhile. (Netflix is on both, so that's a wash.). But for me, the biggest draw of Apple TV is AirPlay.
