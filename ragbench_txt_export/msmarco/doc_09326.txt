As a treat it's OK, but as a primary food it is inadequate. Ferrets need a higher fat and protein content than cat foods contain and canned cat food is usually has lower values than dry. The best thing you can do is feed your ferret a mix of quality ferret foods and premium kitten foods. Canned cat food-not really. They are usually 75% moisture, meaning only 25% of good nutrients in the can. therefore, it would need to eat 4 cans of food for every one cup of normal food. Canned and dry food is generally in the same proportions with dry ingredients, but canned is just a lot more water.
