plants that do not survive the winters where they are planted are called annuals (they can be perennials in other climates) perennial means ongoing. Some plants listed as perennials may or may not endure and return in the spring. This is a perennial question. They come back (most common are lilies, hostas, peonies, herbs like oregano, thyme, lavender, etc.) The great thing about these is they tend to need very little care, and multiply through the years.
