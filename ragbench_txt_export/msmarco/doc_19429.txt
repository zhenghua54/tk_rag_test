I live in Crown Heights in that same area: very close to the Franklyn Ave. stop, near Bedford. If you're North of Eastern Parkway, the area is safe. You didn't indicate the intersections, but there's a lot going on in Crown Heights, and plenty of wonderful places to hang out on Franklyn Ave. and Washington Ave.
