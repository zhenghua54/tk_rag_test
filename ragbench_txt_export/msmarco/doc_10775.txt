Although the spider is not considered to be aggressive, it will often bite people in self-defense. Wolf spiders are venomous, but their bites are not considered dangerous. (Some bite victims who are allergic to spider bites in general may become nauseous, dizzy, and develop an elevated heart rate, however.). Phoneutria are poisonous to humans, and they are considered to be the deadliest of all the worldâ€™s spiders. Their venom is toxic to the nervous system, causing symptoms such as salivation, irregular heartbeat, and prolonged, painful erections (priapism) in men.
