Signs of Danger. Symptoms of coronavirus infection in dogs, cats and humans include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, coughing and sneezing. Cats and humans usually run a fever with a coronavirus where dogs usually do not. Your pet may have coronavirus without you knowing, as symptoms can be absent or cause isolated bouts of sickness. However, once your pet shows symptoms, the virus can turn serious or deadly quickly; consult your veterinarian instead of attempting to treat the disease yourself.
