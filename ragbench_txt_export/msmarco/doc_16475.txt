Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) result from a transformation of plant and animal material over millions of years. The solar energy originally stored in the plant or animal is eventually converted into energy stored in carbon and hydrogen bonds of the fossil fuel. Electricity use for heating is on the rise; however, electricity is not a direct fuel source like the others in this figure. It is a form of energy. Different sources, such as coal and uranium, are used to generate electricity.
