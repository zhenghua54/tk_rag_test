HOW A MAP SENSOR WORKS. MAP sensors are called manifold absolute pressure sensors rather than intake vacuum sensors because they measure the pressure (or lack thereof) inside the intake manifold. When the engine is not running, the pressure inside the intake manifold is the same as the outside barometric pressure. But the MAP sensor doesn't care because it just monitors the absolute pressure inside the intake manifold. On engines with a speed-density electronic fuel injection system, airflow is estimated rather than measured directly with an airflow sensor.
