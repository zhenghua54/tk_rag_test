Cooked rice, when not eaten immediately, should be cooled quickly. To store cooked rice, place in a shallow container, cover, and place in refrigerator. Cooked rice may be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. I also read where it can be frozen for up to 6 months. Ohioan. 08-24-2002, 10:34 AM. I'm usually kind of careless about how long I leave things in the fridge, but even I wouldn't leave cooked rice more than three days.
