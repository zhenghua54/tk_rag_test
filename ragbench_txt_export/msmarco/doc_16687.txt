A sequela (UK /sɨˈkwiːlə/ , US /sɨˈkwɛlə/ ; usually used in the plural, sequelae) is a pathological condition resulting from a disease, injury, therapy, or other trauma. Typically, a sequela is, in medical language, a chronic condition that is a complication of an acute condition that begins during that acute condition. In ordinary language it may be described as a further condition that is different from, but a consequence of, the first condition. Chronic kidney disease, for example, is sometimes a sequela of diabetes, chronic constipation or more accurately obstipation (that is, difficulty in passing stool) is a sequela to an intestinal obstruction, and neck pain is a common sequela of whiplash or other trauma to the cervical vertebrae.
