The following illustration provides an overview of the key terms of this definition of occupational therapy. Occupational therapy makes resources-oriented, targeted use of specific activities, environment adaptation and advice. This enables the client to increase his functional ability in activities of daily living (ADL), his social participation, and his quality of life and life satisfaction. WWhich activities a person needs in daily living at any one given point in his life and which are of particular importance to him are partly determined by the roles he assumes or has to assume in his environment (e.g. role of a mother, role of an employee). Occupational therapy takes these into account.
