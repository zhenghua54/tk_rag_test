When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, their immune system forms antibodies to gluten, which then attack the intestinal lining. This causes inflammation in the intestines and damages the villi, the hair-like structures on the lining of the small intestine. Symptoms of celiac disease vary among sufferers and include: 1  Digestive problems (abdominal bloating, pain, gas, diarrhea, pale stools, and weight loss). 2  A severe skin rash called dermatitis herpitiformis. 3  Anemia (low blood count). 4  Musculoskeletal problems (muscle cramps, joint and bone pain)
