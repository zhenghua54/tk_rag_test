In contrast, in microcytic anemia, the erythrocytes are smaller than normal. In a macrocytic anemia the larger red cells are always associated with insufficient numbers of cells and often also insufficient hemoglobin content per cell. Both of these factors work to the opposite effect of larger cell size, to finally result in a total blood hemoglobin concentration that is less than normal (i.e., anemia). Macrocytic anemia is not a disease in the sense of having a single pathology, but is rather a condition.
