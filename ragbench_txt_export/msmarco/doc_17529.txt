Strain energy. In a molecule, strain energy is released when the constituent atoms are allowed to rearrange themselves in a chemical reaction or a change of chemical conformation in a way that: ⁕angle strain, ⁕torsional strain, ⁕ring strain and/or steric strain, ⁕Allylic strain, and ⁕pentane interference are reduced. The strain energy in the form of elastic deformation is mostly recoverable in the form of mechanical work. For example, the heat of combustion of cyclopropane is higher than that of propane for each additional CH2 unit.
