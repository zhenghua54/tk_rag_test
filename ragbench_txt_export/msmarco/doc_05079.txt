Costs Vary Widely. Nationally, estimates of room addition costs vary from $80 to $250 a square foot. A simple room addition with a basic foundation and no plumbing generally costs at least $100 a square foot with typical internal finishing, no expansion of a heating/cooling unit, and minimal structural changes. An addition with a kitchen can run $250 to $300 a square foot, not counting finishing details like appliances and countertops. An addition with a bathroom can cost $125 to $200 a square foot, again with a number of cost variables including type of flooring, shower and tub, plumbing appliances or custom lighting.
