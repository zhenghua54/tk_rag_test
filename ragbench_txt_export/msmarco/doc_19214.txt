Jaundice may result from serious disorders, such as incompatibility of the newborn’s and mother’s blood type, excessive breakdown of red blood cells, or a severe infection. If jaundice develops in a newborn, parents should call their doctor right away. If jaundice is caused by a disorder, that disorder is treated. Breastfeeding jaundice is common. It develops in 1 of 6 breastfed infants a few days after birth. It occurs in newborns who do not consume enough breast milk (often because the mother's milk has not yet come in well). Newborns who consume less breast milk have fewer bowel movements and thus eliminate less bilirubin.
