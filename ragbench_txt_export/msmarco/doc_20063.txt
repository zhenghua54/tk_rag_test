Brightness temperature is the temperature a black body in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings would have to be to duplicate the observed intensity of a grey body object at a frequency. This concept is extensively used in radio astronomy and planetary science. (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between and; is the temperature of the black body; is Planck's constant; is frequency; is the speed of light; and is Boltzmann's constant.
