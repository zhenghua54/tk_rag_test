The average human cornea is approximately 11.8 millimeters in diameter, so even the smallest scleral contacts are designed to cover the entire corneal surface. In comparison, most conventional GP contact lenses are 9.0 to 9.5 mm in diameter and cover only 75 to 80 percent of the cornea. Another category of gas permeable lenses bridges the size gap between conventional GP lenses and mini-sclerals.
