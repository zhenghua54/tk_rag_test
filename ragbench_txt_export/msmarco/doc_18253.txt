Those of you who think that the popular portal CNET Download.com, which offers software downloads, is a rather safe bet concerning malware, may be forced to reconsider. All products on CNET Download.com now have a direct download link. However only CNET Installer Enabled products call it out separately with a Direct Download Link located underneath the green Download Now button. Bravo CNET.
