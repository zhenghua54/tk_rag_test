Calcium flux through NMDARs is thought to be critical in synaptic plasticity, a cellular mechanism for learning and memory. The NMDA receptor is distinct in two ways: first, it is both ligand-gated and voltage-dependent; second, it requires co-activation by two ligands: glutamate and either D-serine or glycine. A property of the NMDA receptor is its voltage-dependent activation, a result of ion channel block by extracellular Mg 2+ & Zn 2+ ions. This allows the flow of Na + and small amounts of Ca 2+ ions into the cell and K + out of the cell to be voltage-dependent.
