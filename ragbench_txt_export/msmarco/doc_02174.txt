Apart from being good for hair, safflower oil benefits the skin in more ways than one. Dry skin can be easily combated with this oil. This is because of the high content of linolenic acid in it. Because of its light and non greasy texture, the oil is easily absorbed by the skin, making it soft, smooth, and supple. The use of safflower oil is also recommended for treating acne, because the linolenic acid combined with sebum in the skin can help to unclog pores, and thus reduce acne and blackheads. Safflower oil also helps in getting rid of other skin problems like scars, wrinkles and extremely dry and flaky skin.
