In cell division, the cell that is dividing is called the parent cell. The parent cell divides into two daughter cells. The process then repeats in what is called the cell cycle. Cells regulate their division by communicating with each other using chemical signals from special proteins called cyclins. It is also important for cells to stop dividing at the right time. If a cell can not stop dividing when it is supposed to stop, this can lead to a disease called cancer. Some cells, like skin cells, are constantly dividing. We need to continuously make new skin cells to replace the skin cells we lose.
