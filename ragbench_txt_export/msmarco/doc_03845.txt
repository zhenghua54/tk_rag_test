In this experiment, your goal is to determine the molar concentration of two acid solutions by conducting titrations with a base of known concentration. You will be testing hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid solution, and acetic acid (CH 3 CO 2 H), a weak acid, solution. You will use a sodium hydroxide (NaOH), solution as your base of known concentration. The reaction equations are shown below in net ionic form.
