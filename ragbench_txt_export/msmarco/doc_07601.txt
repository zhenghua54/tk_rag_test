General Age Guidelines. Airline rules vary, but here's a good idea of what to expect on domestic flights: Children ages 1 - 4 may fly only when accompanied by an adult. A child must be at least 5 to fly alone. Kids ages 5 - 7 can take a direct flight to a single destination but not connecting flights. Those 8 and up may change aircraft on some airlines.
