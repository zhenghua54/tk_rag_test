I never was told about this potential side effect but was put on it after being admitted to the hospital with my asthma for two days back in late April, was also on Prednisone IV for those two days and then for two weeks after, as well as three other puffers and Singulair. I too went on singulair last year and have gained 10 pounds. I lost almost 70 pounds five years ago and have stuck around the same weight since then...until now. I noticed in my pants and back...I can't zip up any of my dresses anymore. I can understand a pound or two of gain from eating...but not 10 in five months.
