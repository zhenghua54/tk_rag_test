It's best to supplement the soil with black mulch to keep the soil moist; mulch also keeps weeds from damaging the watermelon plant. Germination time for watermelons is between three and 12 days; the seeds require warm temperatures -- 70 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit -- to develop a healthy seedling. Watermelon seeds also need plenty of room to grow; seeds should be at least five feet away from each other. When temperatures are in the high 70s Fahrenheit, the seeds take about five days for germination. Seeds planted in slightly warmer conditions, such as the middle to upper 80s Fahrenheit, will sprout a seedling in four days.
