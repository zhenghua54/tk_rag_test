Lipids such as cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides are stored in your body primarily in specialized fat cells called adipocytes, which comprise a specialized fatty tissue called adipose tissue. Stored lipids can be derived from the lipids in your diet or from lipids that your body synthesizes. Adipocytes have an almost unlimited capacity to store lipids in cell organelles called lipid droplets, which can grow to a very large size.
