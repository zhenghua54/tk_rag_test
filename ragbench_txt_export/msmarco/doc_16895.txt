Schizophrenia is a disease that has several types of symptoms, some of which start earlier than others. The more well-known symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, typically start when a man is around 16 to 19 years old or in his early 20s. A woman with schizophrenia more typically experiences hallucinations or delusions when she is in her mid-20s or early 30s.
