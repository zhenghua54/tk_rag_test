Sphingolipids are a class of lipids with a polar head group and two nonpolar tails. The core of a sphingolipid is an amino alcohol called sphingosine. Complex sphingolipids located in the plasma membrane of animal cells (especially nerve cells) have a structural function and are believed to protect the cell surface from harmful environmental factors.
