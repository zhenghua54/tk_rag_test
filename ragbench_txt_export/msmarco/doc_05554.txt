A Black status Younique presenter earns 30% commission on all retail that they sell. In addition to that, Younique presenters earn 6% on circle royalties, 3% first generation royalties, 4% second generation royalties, and 5% third generation royalties. The amount varies, as you can imagine, based on sales from the presenter and her team. I think so! From the excitement on November 1, 2014 and finding out that I hit elite Green status to the anticipation on November 30, 2014 to see that I hit Exclusive Black status with Younique. Oh my gosh, yâ€™all, this is a month that I will never forget!
