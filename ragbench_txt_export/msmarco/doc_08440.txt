The Kuiper belt is somewhat similar to the asteroid belt (with its rocky, metallic chunks), but the objects are made mostly of ice and frozen gases. This area of the solar system is large and difficult to assess as the objects in it are so far away and are, in general, quite small. There is some 20 to 200 times more mass in the Kuiper belt than in the asteroid belt. As the Kuiper belt is the group of trans-Neptunian objects out to the margin stated, Pluto spends most of its 248-year solar orbital time in the Kuiper belt.
