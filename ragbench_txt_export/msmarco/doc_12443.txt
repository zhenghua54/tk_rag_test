High uric acid levels raise the likelihood of a person having elevated triglyceride levels, visceral obesity (increased waist circumference), insulin resistance, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, all of which represent features of the metabolic syndrome. Thus, although there is no direct relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and high uric acid levels, they are linked by a common denominator: a diet enriched in fructose.
