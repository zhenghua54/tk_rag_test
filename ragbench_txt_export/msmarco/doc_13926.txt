As a physical therapist assistant, you’ll work under the supervision of a physical therapist (PT) to help patients whose ability to move is impaired, from injured athletes to disabled children. You’ll provide the kind of practical, hands-on help that can be truly life-changing. Working as a physical therapist assistant is not a stepping-stone on the way to becoming a physical therapist. To become a PT, you’ll need at least a master’s degree.
