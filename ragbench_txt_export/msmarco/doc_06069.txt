The name ginseng is used to refer to both American (Panax quinquefolius) and Asian or Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng), which belong to the genus Panax and have a somewhat similar chemical makeup. Both Asian and American ginseng contain ginsenosides, which are the substances thought to give ginseng its medicinal properties. But they contain different types in different amounts. Siberian ginseng, or Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) , is an entirely different plant with different effects.
