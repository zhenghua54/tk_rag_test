Serge is a type of twill fabric which has been classically used in uniforms and suiting for centuries. Many department stores stock serge garments, and it can also be purchased from fabric suppliers for custom work. The origins of serge appear to be quite ancient. The word is derived from the Greek serikos, which means “silken,” suggesting that the fabric was probably brought to Europe from China.
