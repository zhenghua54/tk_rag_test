As a result, the H+ ions need to diffuse into the stroma. In order to do this, the ions must travel through an enzyme known as ATP synthase. Once it does, the movement of H+ ions through ATP synthase into the stroma provides energy for ADP to become ATP. The ATP formed is an energy source to power the Calvin cycle. Now, the light-independent (Calvin cycle) reactions occur in
