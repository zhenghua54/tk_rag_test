Split and merge into it. Answer by Anamarasigan. Confidence votes 164. There are three kinds of chemical messengers in the nervous system: Neurotransmitters, endorphins and hormones. 1) Neurotransmitters are released by transmitting neurons. They alter the activity of the receiving neurons. Note that neurotransmitters exist outside of the nervous system as well. I believe they are called chemical messengers because of their function and the fact it is a chemical. They travel through the blood and target cells respond to hormones often â€¦ because of their structure.
