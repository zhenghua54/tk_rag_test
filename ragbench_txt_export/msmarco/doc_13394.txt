A muscle cell is a special kind of cell that makes up an organism's muscle tissues. The muscles allow independent movement and regulate biological functions such as digestion and heartbeat. An organism's muscle tissue is composed of muscle cells. Multi-unit smooth muscle cells operate independently and single-unit, or visceral, smooth muscle cells operate together as a unit. Muscle mass can be gained artificially from injections of performance-enhancing drugs and hormones.
