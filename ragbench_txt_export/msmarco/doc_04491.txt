Excessive alcohol consumption can satisfy caloric requirements, but easily leads to malnutrition and anemia. Although alcohol in small doses is an appetite stimulant, larger amounts suppress hunger, which doubly deprives the body of nutrients. 1 Because alcohol is a diuretic that increases the output of urine, it can cause the loss of such water-soluble minerals such as zinc, magnesium and potassium. 2  Zinc status appears to be particularly affected by alcohol and zinc deficiency interferes with the ability to taste and smell, further limiting dietary intake.
