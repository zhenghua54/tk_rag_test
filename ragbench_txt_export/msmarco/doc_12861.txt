An introduction to Phuket. The largest island in Thailand, Phuket is a mountainous province located in the southern tip of the Andaman Sea. It was originally valued by 17th century Dutch and English explorers as a rich source of tin. The resulting mining industry drew thousands of Chinese laborers to the island. Phuket's most popular beaches sit on the western side of the island. These include Patong Beach, Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach and Nai Harn and Rawai on the southern tip
