Genetic Modification of Bacteria. Bacteria-the first organisms to be genetically engineered-are used for replicating and altering genes that are subsequently introduced into plants or animals. Bacterial systems lend themselves to genetic manipulation in part because of their rapid reproduction rates. Bacteria are routinely used to produce non-bacterial proteins. An example is the production of purified proteins for vaccine use. Such proteins can be safer and as effective as vaccines that contain killed or attenuated (weakened) pathogens.
