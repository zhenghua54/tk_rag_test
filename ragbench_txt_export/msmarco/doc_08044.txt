1 The main objective of weaning is therefore to enable a cow to calve every year by allowing her to regain condition after weaning. 2  Calves are ideally weaned when they are 7 to 8 months old. 3  The right time to wean a calf depends on the condition of the cow and not the age of the calf. 1 In the more western parts of the country calves can be weaned late in May or early June at the age of about 7 to 8 months as the breeding season tends to be later in these areas.
