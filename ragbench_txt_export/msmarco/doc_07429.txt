Women's Reform Movement. A common story runs through textbook accounts of antebellum women reformers. It is a tale of origins and future progress, of new roles for women and the beginning of a movement for gender equality stretching to the present day. This is a compact, readable, and reliable survey of the role of women in antebellum reform, and one that pays attention to class and religious differences among them. The treatment of Seneca Falls and the Women's Rights Movement is brief, but rich.
