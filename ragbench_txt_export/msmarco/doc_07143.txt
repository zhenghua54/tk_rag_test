The most common tick-borne illness in North America and Europe, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected blacklegged tick. You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying the disease thrive. It's important to take common-sense precautions in areas where ticks are prevalent.
