Ghost ants are members of a tiny invasive species that derives its name from the milky white, almost translucent, color of the ant's legs and abdomens. The color makes them difficult to see. Baits are Better. Since ghost ants form several nests, the use of bait tends to be more effective in eradication than insecticide sprays which can kill the ant before it can return to its nest and poison the others. Ghost ants favor sweets so baits with a sugar or honey base work best.
