1 Pheochromocytoma is a relatively rare tumor of the adrenal glands or of similar specialized cells outside of the adrenal glands. 2  Pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamine hormones (adrenaline and related hormones) that are responsible for the characteristic symptoms. The catecholamine-secreting cells are sometimes referred to as chromaffin cells, and they are found in other areas of the body as well as in the adrenal medulla. Sometimes, pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells that are located outside of the adrenal gland.
