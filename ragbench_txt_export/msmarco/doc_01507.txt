A Dr. Michael Roizen, MD, Internal Medicine, answered. Sperm dictates the sex of the fertilized egg. However, a lot of mutual factors contribute to gender, including as the egg's receptivity to the male's chromosomes. So if a couple has five girls, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the man's fault. In humansâ€™ the sex of the baby is determined by the sperm. The sperm gamete is heterogamatic because approximately half of them contain the X chromosome which will result in a girl and approximately half of them contain the Y chromosome which will result in a boy.
