Safflower oil, as the name suggests, is a form of oil that is extracted from the seeds of the safflower plant. There are two types of safflower oil; one is rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and the other is rich in polyunsaturated fats (PUFA). The use of safflower oil is also recommended for treating acne, because the linolenic acid combined with sebum in the skin can help to unclog pores, and thus reduce acne and blackheads. Safflower oil also helps in getting rid of other skin problems like scars, wrinkles and extremely dry and flaky skin.
