Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan, IPA: [ɸɯᵝꜜdʑisaɴ] (listen)) , located on Honshu Island, is the highest mountain in Japan at 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft). An active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707–08, Mount Fuji lies about 100 kilometres (60 mi) south-west of Tokyo, and can be seen from there on a clear day. Today, Mount Fuji is an international destination for tourism and mountain climbing. In the early 20th century, populist educator Frederick Starr 's Chautauqua lectures about his several ascents of Mount Fuji—1913, 1919, and 1923—were widely known in America.
