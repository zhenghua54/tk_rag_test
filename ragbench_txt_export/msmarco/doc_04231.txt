We use coconut oil as one of our main cooking fats, along with local pastured butter and organic olive oil. Coconut oil has a higher smoking point than olive oil and butter, so it's very useful in high heat cooking. It makes the best popcorn when mixed with ghee and you can't beat potatoes fried in coconut oil. About half of virgin coconut oil's saturated fat is lauric acid, a medium-chain triglyceride that turns out to have a number of health-promoting properties, including the ability to improve levels of good HDL cholesterol.
