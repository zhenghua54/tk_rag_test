For infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, postvaccination testing should be performed 1–2 months after completion of ≥3 doses of a licensed hepatitis B vaccine series (i.e., at age 9–18 months, generally at the next well-child visit). When necessary, postvaccination testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) should generally be performed 1–2 months after completion of the vaccine series.
