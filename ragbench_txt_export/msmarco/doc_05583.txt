Best Answer: The 26' U-Haul truck will get between 5-7 miles per gallon. So, you would use between 143 - 200 gallons. If you take it easy on the pedal and drive on the slower side [60 -62 miles per hour] you should be able to average right at 7 MPG. The national average of fuel is 3.90 per gallon so using that average it would cost you between 557.00 - 780.00. ----- The U-Haul trucks use gasoline for all sizes, Penske and Budget uses diesel for the larger trucks so they get 7-9 miles per gallon.
