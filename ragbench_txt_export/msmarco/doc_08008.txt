In addition, not all boroughs are created equally. Manhattan is, not surprisingly, the most expensive borough in which to build, with average hard construction costs for buildings over 10 stories logging in between $400 and $600 per square foot, according to IVI Internationalâ€™s Barone. A few years ago, the highest-end condominium projects in the city cost about $650 per square foot to build. And back in 2005, the developers of 15 Central Park West shelled out only about $400 per foot to construct their gold-standard condo project.
