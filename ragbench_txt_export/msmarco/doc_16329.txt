As a general rule, watering should be deep and infrequent, as this helps plants to establish a strong root system. The time of day that gardeners water the garden is also important. The best time of day to water outside plants is early morning, before the heat of the day has set in. This reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation, and also provides water for the plants to help them get through the heat of the day.
