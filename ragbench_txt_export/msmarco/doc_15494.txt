Salmonella & Proteus (A & D) ferment the glucose (present in low concentration) but do not ferment the lactose or sucrose. These organisms use the protein at the aerobic surface of the slant as a carbon source, the pH increases and the top of the slant becomes red. The black is due to hydrogen sulfide production. Substantial hydrogen sulfide production by Proteus mirabilis makes it difficult to determine color in the butt of the slant.
