You can successfully grow cucumbers in containers but you may need to water 2-3 times a day. Cucumbers are mostly water and the fruits will wither and the plants will die if the soil dries out for very long. If you put 3-4 inch layer of mulch over the soil, you can water a little less, but still twice a day is best. I planted cucumber seeds about three weeks ago. About fifteen in a cup as the directions told me so but they all came up and after growing to about seven inches tall with 2 leaves overnight they all wilted. That day I got a large deep pot and transplanted all of them added a little plant food.
