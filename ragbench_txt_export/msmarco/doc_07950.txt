There are two basic types of parachutes. One is a dome canopy made of fabric in a shape that ranges from a hemisphere to a cone; the canopy traps air inside its envelope, creating a region of high pressure that retards movement in the direction opposite the entering air flow. In addition to the fabric canopy, a parachute designed to be used by a person must be equipped with a harness that is worn by the user. Attached to the harness is a container that holds the canopy; often this is a back-pack, but it can also extend low enough for the user to sit on it.
