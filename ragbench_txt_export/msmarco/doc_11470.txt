Muscle Fiber Composition. Types of muscle fibers. Most mammalian muscles are composed of a mix of at least three different fiber types; indeed, muscles composed of nearly homogenous fiber type are the exception. The mechanical capabilities of each type of muscle stem from differences in the structures and metabolic properties of different types of muscle fibers. Within the muscle, all muscle fibers within a given motor unit are of the same type.
