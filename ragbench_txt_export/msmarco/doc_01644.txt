How wisdom teeth are removed. Your dentist may remove your wisdom teeth or they may refer you to a specialist surgeon for hospital treatment. Before the procedure, you'll usually be given a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area around the tooth. The time it takes to remove the tooth will vary. Some procedures only take a few minutes, whereas others can take 20 minutes or longer. After your wisdom teeth have been removed, you may experience swelling and discomfort, both on the inside and outside of your mouth. This is usually worse for the first three days, but it can last for up to two weeks. Read more about how a wisdom tooth is removed and recovering from wisdom tooth removal
