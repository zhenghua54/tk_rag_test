Cyprus is a remarkably safe country, with very little violent crime. However, it is wise to be careful when accepting drinks from strangers, especially in Paphos, since there have been numerous occasions of muggings. Cyprus' main airport is Larnaca International Airport (LCA) and is on the outskirts of Larnaka. The previous main international airport located SW of Nicosia is now located on the Green Line separating the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus-it has been out of use since 1974.
