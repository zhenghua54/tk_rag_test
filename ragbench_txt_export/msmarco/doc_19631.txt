The Japanese Spitz, also bred from the German Spitz, is very similar to the Spitz Klein but is limited to the white colour and has a different breed history. The Zwergspitz, the Pomeranian, is also registered as a separate breed in the UK and North America. All the German Spitz type dogs are dogs of the Spitz type of German origin.
