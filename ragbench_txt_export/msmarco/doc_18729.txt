Usually, if temperature and humidity levels have been ideal, the hatchling will start to break through the shell 21 days after the eggs were first set. However, this is a 'rule of thumb'. Sometimes it takes longer and sometimes shorter times-I've had a hatch as late as day 25 (as in the image below). One of my chicks hatched at day 19. Early hatching is generally due to temperatures being too high, either during shipping if eggs were sent by post, or in the incubator itself. It's possible that the chick will be smaller than others who go the full 21 days, and they can also be weaker.
