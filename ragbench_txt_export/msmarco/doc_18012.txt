Causes of Muscle Spasms. Muscle spasms in the back can often be caused by a twisting or strain on one of the back muscles, which in turn causes involuntary muscle contractions. Although this often occurs when tense, tight back muscles are present, it can happen in any circumstance. As a result of the contraction people often complain of having symptoms of either a locked back, or a knot in their back. Among the most common causes of muscle spasms in the back... 1  a sneeze or cough. 2  lifting heavy objects. 3  incorrect sitting posture. 4  muscle overuse, or injury. 5  dehydration.
