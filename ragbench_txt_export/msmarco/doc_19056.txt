Look at the back of your computer and locate an available VGA or DVI port. The VGA or DVI cord from the second monitor will fit the port. Tip. Purchase and install an AGP or PCI video card if your computer does not have an available port. Step 2: Attach second monitor. Plug in the second monitor and turn it on. Connect the best monitor to the DVI port to optimize your hardware. Restart your computer. Tip. If neither monitor comes with a DVI port, use a DVI-to-VGA adapter to connect the monitor. Step 3: Setup on Windows. Set up the second monitor on a PC by right-clicking the Desktop and then clicking Properties. On the Display Properties window, click the Settings tab.
