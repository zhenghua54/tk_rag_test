Cost of Redoing the Electrical in a House. In older homes, even changing an outlet can quickly require a major electrical overhaul. Updating the electrical wiring in a house is not the way most homeowners want to spend their remodeling budget. Rewiring an entire house can range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. The cost depends heavily on the age and construction of the house, instead of the size of the home. For example, if you are upgrading an old fuse box to a circuit breaker, that's a good time to upgrade the service to your house to a 200 amp service, simply because the service will often have to be disconnected and reconnected anyway. This project can cost between $700 and $1,500.
