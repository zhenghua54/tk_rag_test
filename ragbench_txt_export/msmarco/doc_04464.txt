The way to test for diabetes is to measure your blood glucose level. A random test is done at any time, to get a snapshot picture of the glucose concentration in your bloodstream. If someone has symptoms of diabetes but the random blood glucose level is below 200 mg/dL, the doctor will want to follow up with a fasting blood glucose test or other test.
