Last update: June 2013 (includes new FHA rules & rates). When your down payment is less than 20%, you usually have to pay for Mortgage Insurance, (PMI). This protects the lender in case you don't make your house payments, they repossess your house, and they have to sell it for less than the amount left on the loan. Your down payment is $10,000 and the morgtage is $190,000. Divide the $190,000 mortgage by 1500 and you get your monthly PMI cost, $127. PMI doesn't change as the outstanding balance changes.
