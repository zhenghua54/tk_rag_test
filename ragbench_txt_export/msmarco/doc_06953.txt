Praying Mantis are absolutely harmless to humans. In fact they are considered beneficial insects because they will eat garden pests. They are called preying mantis because they hold their front legs up in front of their faces and it looks like they are praying. This pose is really to wait for prey (no one knows what they are thinking).
