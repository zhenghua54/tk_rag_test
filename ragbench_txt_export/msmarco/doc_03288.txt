The practice of acupuncture is based on understanding the flow of qi, or vital energy in nature and in ourselves. The Chinese have mapped the flow of qi through our bodies along specific pathways called meridians. When our qi is full and flowing, we experience health. When our qi is obstructed or imbalanced, illness and pain can occur. The symptoms we experience are signals that we need to take measures to restore balance.
