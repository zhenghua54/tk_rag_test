1 A down-to-the-dirt professional demolition (including removing the foundation/basement) using heavy machinery and hauling away all debris can be $10,000-$25,000 or more, depending on size, materials, configuration (one-or two-story), local rates and access. 1 A homeowner separated a garage and attached sunroom from the rest of the house, then paid a demolition company $6,000 to tear them down and excavate down 6-9 feet (to prepare for a new structure).
