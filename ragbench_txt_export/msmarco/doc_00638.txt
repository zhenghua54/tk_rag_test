The Punjab region of India and Pakistan has a historical and cultural link to Indo-Aryan peoples as well as partially to various indigenous communities. As a result of several invasions from Central Asia and the Middle East, many ethnic groups and religions make up the cultural heritage of Punjab. Sikhism, a religion founded in the late 15th century, is the main religion practised in Indian Punjab. About 60% of the population of the post-1966 Indian Punjab is Sikh, 37% is Hindu, and the rest are Muslims, Christians, and Jains.
