I'm pretty sure the tile cost about $2-3/square foot although they didn't break it down. Thats seems really excessive for the labor portion. I'm going to talk to my builder and the tile store b/c that is well over our budget. My builder had allocated $10-12 square foot for labor and $2-3/square foot for tile. For example: In our basement bath-the cost to tile a 3x5 tub surround(about 78 sqaure feet) came in at $1818. I've chosen basic plain white 6 x 6 porcelain tile which I was told is pretty cheap. That is $23/sqaure feet.
