Kirinite is a very, very interesting synthetic material. Let’s look at the different aspects of it. Number one, kirinite is pretty durable. It’s at least as durable as a good hardwood, and probably a little lighter than a pair of hard ironwood scales. On top of that, it won’t shrink or warp like wood will do over time and with changes in humidity. Another plus in the aesthetic side of things, as far as kirinite goes, is that it takes a fantastic polish without becoming slick and hard to grip. To get that smooth of a finish on a wood handle you have to put some type of finish on it to fill the grains, which is a lot of hassle.
