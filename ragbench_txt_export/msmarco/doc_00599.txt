The 73 counties who provided information for this study reported a total of 1,402 mentally. retarded persons in residential facilities other than state institutions. The total monthly cost of care for. these persons was $191,560, an average monthly cost of $136 per person. The maximum cost to counties would be $10 per month per resident rather. than the present average monthly cost of $164. State participation in the cost of caring for the people in these private facilities, under the. proposed bill, would be $1,039,452 annually.
