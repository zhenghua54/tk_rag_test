An MBA program inherits both institutional and specialized accreditation from the institution. So, there are really two levels of accreditation available for MBA degrees. In other words, an MBA can hold institutional accreditation only or it can have both institutional and specialized accreditation. Accreditation is the certification that a school or program meets a prescribed academic standard. It is the primary way that institutions assure quality and continuous improvement to students, potential employers, other schools, and the public in general.
