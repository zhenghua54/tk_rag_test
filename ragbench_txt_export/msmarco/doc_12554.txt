List of Senate Presidents [edit]. This list includes Vice Presidents and Presidents pro tempore who served as a Presiding Officer of the Senate (not including senators who presided over sessions temporarily in the place of the sitting President). However, during a vacancy in the office (such as that caused by death, resignation or presidential succession), the President pro tempore of the United States Senate serves as the permanent President of the Senate.
