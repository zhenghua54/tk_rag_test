Kosher animals are those that comply with the regulations of Jewish dietary law and are considered fit to eat. These food regulations ultimately derive from various passages in the Torah with various modifications, additions and clarifications added to these rules by traditional Jewish law. According to these, anything that  chews the cud  and has a cloven hoof is ritually clean, but those animals that only chew the cud or only have cloven hooves are unclean. Both documents explicitly list four animals as being ritually impure: 1  The camel, for chewing the cud without its hooves being divided.
