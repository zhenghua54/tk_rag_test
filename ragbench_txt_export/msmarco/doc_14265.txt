All eucaryotic cells have an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) . Its membrane typically constitutes more than half of the total membrane of an average animal cell (see Table 12-2). The ER is organized into a netlike labyrinth of branching tubules and flattened sacs extending throughout the cytosol (Figure 12-35).
