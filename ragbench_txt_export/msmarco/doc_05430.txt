1 For example, Production Fence Works in Georgia estimates its basic 6' wood privacy fence (with pressure-treated fence posts in concrete) costs an average of $11.30 a foot in treated pine and $14.99 a foot in Western red cedar. Made with wood, with vinyl or screened chain link, a privacy fence is typically 4'-6' tall and solid, designed to block an area from view. Although it's possible to enclose an entire yard with a privacy fence, because of cost it can be more practical to screen a smaller area, like a patio, pool or hot tub.
