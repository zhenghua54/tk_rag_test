The sulfite oxidation reaction rate was then measured photographically for various sodium sulfite and Co 2+ 2+ concentrations. The sulfite oxidation reaction rate was affected by the mass transfer characteristics of the gasâ€“liquid absorbers with the cobalt ion catalyst as well as the reaction kinetics.
