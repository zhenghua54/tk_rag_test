It all depends on the track and the purse. Usually, a Nascar driver can finish last and still earn between $50,000 to $70,000. The winners could make over $300,000, it changes each week. Sometimes more and sometimes less. The Daytona 500 is the highest paying race, where the winner and the second place driver earn over $1 million each. Usually sponsorship on a start & park car is usually 10,000-20,000 a race. And a driver gets a good part of that too. So to answer your question alot. In the Nationwide series its between $1,000-$2,000 a race and trucks its 4900-$1
