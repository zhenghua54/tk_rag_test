The Appalachian Trail near Clingmans Dome in the Great Smoky Mountains. One of the oldest long trails in the U.S., the Appalachian Trail is the quintessential long-distance hike. The “A.T.,” as it’s known, stretches from Georgia’s Springer Mountain to Maine’s Mount Katahdin. Touted as the country’s oldest long trail, the aptly named Long Trail follows the north-south spine of Vermont’s Green Mountains from the Massachusetts border to Canada. The main trail is about 270 miles, with an additional 175 miles of spurs and side trails.
