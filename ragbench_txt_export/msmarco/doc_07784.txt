There is also an issue of your plants having been grown indoors and never exposed to low temps. That is exactly what the major plant growers (Bonnie, etc) do. They maintain greenhouse temps at minimum 65 degrees to keep the plants growing rapidly. The result is a plant that cannot tolerate temperatures below 65 degrees. All things considered, you would have been better served to have set your plants outdoors in their pots for the day and then back indoors at night.
