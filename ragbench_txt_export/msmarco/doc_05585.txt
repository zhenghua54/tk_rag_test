An example of U-Haul gas mileage. Let’s look at what this would mean for a 24-foot U-Haul rental truck, moving long distance from New York, NY to Dallas, TX (1,547 miles). With a 60 gallon gas tank and 6 MPG, you could expect to fill the loaded U-Haul up about four times along the way. According to the Rental Truck Fuel Calculator, with today’s fuel prices, that comes to about $626 for fuel – or about $160 each time you stop. To put this into perspective, a Honda Pilot has a 19.5 gallon tank and averages 22 mpg, so you could go about 429 miles on a tank of gas. 384 Shares. Because gas isn't included in the cost of a rental truck, it's wise to figure out how much extra you'll pay to fuel it up before choosing one for your long distance move.
