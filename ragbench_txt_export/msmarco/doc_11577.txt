Annual Salary After Tax Calculation. Divide the proposed annual salary by the pay period frequency (how many times you will receive a paycheck in a year). For example, if your annual salary is $31,200.00 and you will be paid weekly (52 times within the year), your weekly salary is $600.00. For example, a $600.00 salary minus $8.70 for Medicare, $25.20 for Social Security, $57.00 for federal and $21.97 for state taxes is a weekly salary of $487.13 per week after taxes.
