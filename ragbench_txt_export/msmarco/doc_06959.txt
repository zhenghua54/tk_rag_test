I am curious if praying mantis species' found here in the U.S. are poisonous because where I am from (Paraguay,South America) the name that the praying mantis is given translates to mother of the snake because it's venom is more deadly than that of a snake. In fact they are considered beneficial insects because they will eat garden pests. They are called preying mantis because they hold their front legs up in front of their faces and it looks like they are praying. This pose is really to wait for prey (no one knows what they are thinking).
