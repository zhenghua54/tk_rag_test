Definition: An apostle was one of Jesus Christ 's 12 closest disciples, chosen by him early in his ministry to spread the gospel after his death and resurrection. In the Bible, they are called Jesus' disciples until the Lord's ascension into heaven, then they are referred to as apostles. The word apostle is derived from the Greek apostolos, meaning one who is sent.. A modern-day apostle would typically function as a church planterâ€”one who is sent out by the body of Christ to spread the gospel and establish new communities of believers.
