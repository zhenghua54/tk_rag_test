Virtually all adults in the United States consume too much sodium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010.. Although your body requires a small amount of dietary sodium daily to replace quantities lost through sweat, urine and stool, too much may adversely affect your health. Adequate daily intake for older Americans is 1,300 milligrams from age 50 through 70 and 1,200 milligrams after age 70. These recommendations take into account typical losses and the amount of sodium you are likely to consume while meeting other essential nutrient requirements.
