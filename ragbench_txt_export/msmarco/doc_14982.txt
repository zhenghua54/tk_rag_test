Mostaccioli is a tube shaped pasta, with ridges, about 2 long. Penne is smaller, about 1/2 and is smooth unless using penne rigata. Pasta shapes get substituted occasionally and penne may be considered more bite sized by some. It will work in most mostaccioli recipes, but would be difficult to stuff with a filling. Mostaccioli is popular in the Campagnia region of Southern Italy and is usually a little large than penne. Both penne and mostaccioli can be smooth (lisce) or ridged (rigate).
