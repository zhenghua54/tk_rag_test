It is also worth defining the difference between accuracy and precision: 1  GPS accuracy: The accuracy refers to the degree of closeness the indicated readings are to the actual position. 2  GPS precision: Is the degree to which the readings can be made. 3  The smaller the circle of unknown the higher the precision. GPS accuracy is far greater than anything that was previously available, and it is sufficiently accurate for most applications. However there are GPS errors that have been significant for some applications, and much work has been undertaken to reduce the level of GPS errors to a level where they are insignificant.
