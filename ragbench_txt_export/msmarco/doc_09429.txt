The Gates' Mansion is a large mansion that overlooks Lake Washington in Medina, Washington. The 66,000-square-foot (6,100 m 2) mansion is noted for its design and the technology it incorporates. It is nicknamed Xanadu 2.0 after the title character's estate in Citizen Kane. Many trees block much of the house from view from Lake Washington. The house was the result of a collaboration between Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Architects (based in Pennsylvania but with satellite offices in Seattle and San Francisco) and Cutler-Anderson Architects of Bainbridge Island
