Genotype refers to the genetic traits in an organism. It has to do with the genetic coding of an organism. Such coding is inheritable. The genotype is the genetic load that is copied every time a cell divides, and therefore is inherited down to the next generation. Phenotype refers to observable, physical manifestations of an organism. The phenotype includes physical characteristics, behaviors corresponding to such species, structures, organs, behaviors, relfexes, etc. The genotype is the genetic programming that provides the phenotype.
