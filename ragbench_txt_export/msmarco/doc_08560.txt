A pulled calf muscle usually happens suddenly due to injury, but can develop gradually from overuse. A calf muscle strain most commonly affects the larger, more superficial gastrocnemius muscle but can affect the soleus muscle as well. Other common terms for the condition include a calf muscle strain or torn calf muscle. Essentially, what all these terms refer to is when the calf muscles are pulled beyond their normal elastic limit, overstretching them and damaging some or all of muscle fibres.
