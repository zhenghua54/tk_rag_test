There are many incorrect definitions of language, and this is one. Some language is not vocal. And arbitrary symbols would be unintelligible to anyone except the person making them up. Better to define language as a complex system of symbols used to convey meaning, feeling and intent. Still not a complete definition, but at least it is not wrong
