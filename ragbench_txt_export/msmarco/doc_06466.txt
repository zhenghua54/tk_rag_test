One of the coating weight designation systems in this standard uses descriptors such as G60, G90, etc. The “G” means the coating is galvanize (zinc), and the numbers refer to the weight of zinc on the surface of the steel sheet in inch-pound (English/Imperial) units. No inch-pound designations are used since single side coatings are traditionally ordered in SI units only. Examples are: 60G 70G 90G These designations specify the minimum and maximum SST value on each surface, e.g., 60G requires a minimum of 60 g/m 2 and a maximum of 110 g/m 2 of zinc on each surface for any SST.
