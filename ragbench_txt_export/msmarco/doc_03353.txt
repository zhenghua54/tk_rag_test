Today, the average sodium intake in an American diet is about 3,400 mg a day — 30 to 50 percent more than the recommended amount. And if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and consume too much sodium, you are at greater risk for complications, including high blood pressure and heart disease. According to the 2010 guidelines, sodium should be limited to 2,300 mg a day. For people 51 years or older, African Americans and anyone who has hypertension, diabetes or CKD, the new sodium goal is 1,500 mg a day. About half of the United States’ population and the majority of adults fall into this category.
