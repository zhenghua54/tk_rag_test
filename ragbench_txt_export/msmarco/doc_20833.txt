The input speed sensor measures the RPM of the input shaft of the transmission. With the engine running and the vehicle in gear (forward or reverse), if the car or truck is not moving, the input shaft of the transmission is also not moving. This is because the torque converter, which is a fluid drive, allows this effect, which is perceived as 'slipping'. When the input shaft moves, the input speed sensor detects this motion, and wires deliver this signal to the control module. The Vehicle Speed Sensor measures vehicle speed. If it fails or malfunctions the automatic transmission may not operate properly. It may also cause the automatic transmission to go into failsafe mode making it appear that the problem is more severe than it actually is.
