Deduct the points over the life of the loan if you cannot meet all of the requirements to deduct them immediately. If your loan is for 30 years then you can deduct 1/30th of the points each year on your taxes. Typically you must deduct the points on a refinance mortgage over the life of the loan unless part of the refinance proceeds are used to improve the main home.
