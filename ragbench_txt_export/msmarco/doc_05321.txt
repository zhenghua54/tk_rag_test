A combined experimental and theoretical study on the racking strength and stiffness of cold-formed steel wall frames is presented. A variety of bracing methods including no bracing, bracing with cement particle board or oriental strand board, and bracing with single or double X strap are investigated. 9, strap width has a relatively small effect on racking failure load and strap force, but great influence on the deflection. For a 10 times increase in strap width, the racking failure load only increases by about 10%, whereas the deflection is reduced by about 5 times.
