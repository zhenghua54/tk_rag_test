Named for one of the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, the Villa Urquiza style of tango is typically danced with an upright body posture with the two dancers maintaining separate axes and looking toward the clasped hands of the embrace. To the extent that orillero-style tango is still danced it has become more like the Villa Urquiza style of tango. It is danced with upright body posture with the dancers maintaining separate axes, and the embrace is typically offset in a V and can be either close or open.
