Proof of this theory was the battery, which Volta invented in 1800. He built in 1800 the first electrical pile, or battery: a series of metal disks of two kinds, separated by cardboard disks soaked with acid or salt solutions. Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). A century and a half after Galileo's death, something of scientific importance was to develop in Italy. Volta found that it was the presence of two dissimilar metals, not the frog leg, that was critical. In 1800, after extensive experimentation, he developed the voltaic pile.
