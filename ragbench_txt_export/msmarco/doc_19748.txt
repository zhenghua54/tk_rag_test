If the wood trim you want to be painted is inside the house, a water-based paint will be the safest paint to use. Exterior paint, such as acrylic and enamel, is overkill for an interior painting job. The only time you want to use an exterior paint on interior wood trim is when you need a glossy and durable finish.
