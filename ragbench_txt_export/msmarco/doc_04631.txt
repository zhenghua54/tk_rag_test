Net curtains are a fantastically practical addition to your living space. The thin, semi-transparent material helps to maintain privacy in your home whist still allowing sunlight to stream through your windowpanes and illuminate the room. Net curtains are sometimes known as voile curtains or voile panels, and are characterised by the sheer net like material that are commonly used as a window dressing, functioning as a privacy veil during the daytime.
