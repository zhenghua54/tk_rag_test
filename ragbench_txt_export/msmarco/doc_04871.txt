Facebook. First the warning: there are s cams aplenty promising to show you who is stalking your Facebook page. I put in a call to Facebook and spoke with their technical folks-the truth is no-one can see who's been on your Facebook page. There are no features buried in the Facebook settings with that data. Facebook says it is one of the most common scam come-ons on the site. Don't fall for it; you cannot see who's looking at your profile (and no one can see if you've been looking at theirs).
