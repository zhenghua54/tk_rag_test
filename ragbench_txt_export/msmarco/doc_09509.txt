Enable your iPhone or iPod touch. Apple doesn’t allow you to enable disk use on an iPhone or iPod touch, but that doesn’t mean you can’t turn either into a portable storage device if it’s got space to spare. Here are a few iPhone apps that’ll turn your iPhone or iPod touch into a wireless (yes, wireless!) drive. If you set iTunes to automatically sync music to your iPod, you’ll need to enable disk use; connect your iPod to your Mac, open iTunes, and select your iPod in the Source pane under Devices. Click the Summary tab (or Settings tab for iPod shuffle) and then select the “Enable disk use” checkbox.
