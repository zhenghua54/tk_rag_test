Across the continent of their natural habitat, the platypus mostly lives in freshwater lakes, rivers, lagoons, farm dams, and streams. Most platypuses are found in bodies of water that have earth banks with roots, overhanging vegetation, reeds, and logs to be more suitable for constructing their burrows.
