Juvederm for the Lips. Juvederm is an injectable gel made from Hyaluraonic Acid that is used to replace or add volume to areas of the face where more fullness is desired or where lines and wrinkles have formed. Juvederm is frequently used around the mouth and in the lips to enhance the shape and fullness of the lips. Juvederm is used to erase smokerâ€™s lines, marionette lines, and other lines that can form around the mouth area.
