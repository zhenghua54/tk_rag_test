While being a landlord can be stressful and expensive, I believe that the future rewards will be worth it. Our two rental properties will be paid off in approximately 14 years…right in time for our two small children to begin college. We could use the rental income to pay for our children’s education. As a future landlord this is a great article. I’m sure a lot of new landlords don’t figure in the cost of maintenance, taxes, property taxes, insurance ect.. when they first think about becoming landlords. They also don’t think of the pitfalls of dealing with some really bad tenants.
