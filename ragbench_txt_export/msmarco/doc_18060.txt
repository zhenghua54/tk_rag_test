================ with the infinity mirror it is similar except the light is reflected back by the first mirror..instead of a camera so the image say you have just a mirror there the light from that mirror will shine back to the the other mirror .. this mirror will now have THE IMAGE of the first mirror and its own image .. the light will then reflect back from that to the first one producing the image of the the second mirror with the image of the first mirror on it..
