To prepare a NaOH solution with an exact molar concentration, itmust be standardized with an acid that is a primary standard.In Part A of this experiment, dry potassium hydrogen phthalate, KHC 8 H 4 O 4, is usedas the primary acid standard for determining the molar concentration of a sodium hy-droxide solution. A. Standardization of a Sodium Hydroxide Solution Approximate molar concentration of diluted NaOH solution (Part A.3). Show calculations.Approximate mass of KHC 8 H 4 O 4 for the standardization of the NaOH solution (Part A.4). Show calculations.
