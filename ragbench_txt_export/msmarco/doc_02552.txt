Introduced in the 1960s, the ACT has become a viable alternative to the SAT when it comes to college admissions testing. Comprised of four mandatory sections (English, Math, Reading, Science) and one optional (Writing), the ACT is not only structured differently from the SAT, but also shorter. In total, with the optional writing section, the ACT sections take 2 hours and 55 minutes to complete. Once breaks and test administration time are added in, students can expect to spend four hours on the ACT
