The rule of thumb is to start out by saving 10% of your pay every month to start out. Eventually you should be able to save 20% every month. That may seem like a lot. If you make $5000 a month you will want to save anywhere between $500 and $1000. In todayâ€™s economy, this could be difficult. If this is the case, you need save what you are comfortable with while working to lower your expenses. Many financial planners recommend that you use the 50-20-30 plan.
