Welcome to the Friends of Lapham Peak. The Friends of Lapham Peak was founded in 1989 as a nonprofit group dedicated to supporting and promoting the Kettle Moraine State Forest – Lapham Peak Unit in a variety of ways. The park is located 3/4 mile south of I-94 on County Hwy C (Delafield exit). The main attraction of the park is the 45 foot observation tower atop the highest point in Waukesha County. The park’s glaciated topography provides excellent hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing on the lighted trails.
