When bilirubin levels are high, the skin and whites of the eyes may appear yellow (jaundice). Jaundice may be caused by liver disease (hepatitis), blood disorders (hemolytic anemia), or blockage of the tubes (bile ducts) that allow bile to pass from the liver to the small intestine. The bilirubin test is used to: 1  Check liver function and watch for signs of liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or the effects of medicines that can damage the liver. 2  Find out if something is blocking the bile ducts. 3  This may occur if gallstones, tumors of the pancreas, or other conditions are present.
