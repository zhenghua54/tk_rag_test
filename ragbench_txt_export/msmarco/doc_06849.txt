Glowstone is an infinite light source and has a higher light level than torches (15 as opposed to 14.) Because it is a block, players often make ceiling lights and lamp posts out of glowstone by combining it with a fence block. Glowstone blocks can also be used as lit paths, due to their interesting texture, or in docks or harbors so players in boats can see where to stop, since it can be placed in water. Also, glowstone can be used as a source of light for growing crops at night.
