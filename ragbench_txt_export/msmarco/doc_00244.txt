This standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or data about data. In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, Value Domains, and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. While the metadata application is manyfold covering a large variety of fields, there are specialised and well-accepted models to specify types of metadata. Bretheron & Singley (1994) distinguish between two distinct classes: structural/control metadata and guide metadata.
