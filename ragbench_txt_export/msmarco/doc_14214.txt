Molasses. Molasses, from the Latin word melaceres, meaning honey-like, is a thick dark syrup that is a byproduct of sugar refining. It results when sugar is crystallized out of sugar cane or sugar beet juice. Molasses is sold both for human consumption, to be used in baking, and in the brewing of ale and distillation of rum, and as an ingredient in animal feed. In addition to molasses, which is itself a byproduct of the processing of sugar cane, there are several others materials that are used for other purposes. After pressing the juice out of the cane stalks, the dry stalk residue, called bagasse, are used as fuel in the plant.
