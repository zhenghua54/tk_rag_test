If you've ever had a Subconjunctival Hemorrhage (Broken Blood Vessel in Eye), how long did it take for it to heal? I've read it can take anywhere from 7-14 days on average. I've had one for 12 days and although the blood spot looks a bit lighter red, I don't see much reduction in the size of the blood spot. A hemorrhage in the back of the eye-on the retina, is more serious an can be caused by a number of diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc). (+ info). I know that this can take up to two weeks to fully disappear (according to the internet).
