Lewis Acid-Base Theory. In 1923, G. N. Lewis introduced a theory of acids and bases that is even more powerful than the Br nsted theory. As a result, it is important to differentiate between the terms acid and base as they have been used so far and the terms Lewis acid and Lewis base.. Lewis noted that the Br nsted theory was limited because it focused exclusively on the transfer of a proton (H +). He argued that a more general definition of acid-base reactions could be obtained by looking at what happens when an H + ion combines with an OH-ion to form water.
