This is called maintaining homeostasis. The hypothalamus also maintains homeostasis in lots of other ways, such as by controlling your blood pressure. The hypothalamus also controls many of your hormones. It does this by being a sort of gatekeeper for other glands that release hormones. When your hypothalamus senses a change in your body, it will tell the right gland how to help correct that change. The hypothalamus does many things, but two of its most important jobs are to maintain homeostasis and to control certain hormones. Homeostasis is very important to all animals, including humans. If we look at the word, we see that homeo means “the same”, and stasis means “not moving”, or “holding”.
