Basic education in Thailand extends from grades 1-12. It consists of six years of primary education, three years of lower secondary, and three years of upper secondary education. The entry age into basic education is at the age of 6. The gross enrolment ratio in lower secondary education is over 90% and for upper secondary education it is about 60% in 2010. Equality in terms of gender parity index (GPI) is impressive, with almost 1:00 for every level of basic education (UIS n.d. ).
