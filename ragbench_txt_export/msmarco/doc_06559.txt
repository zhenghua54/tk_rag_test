Best Answer: Here in Maine the white tail deer starts the breeding process in September and lasts until January. There are 5 phases of the rut for breeding in the buck's hierarchy. The gestation period is 180 days and usually born in late spring. The doe will usually give birth to twins if she is a healthy deer. The fawns usually are born between May and June and by the fall, the fawns have lost all of there spots. I have seen late bloomers too, and have a hard time through the winter months.
