An indicator may be needed. Often a titration is repeated until successive titres are within 0.1 cm 3. An indicator is a substance that undergoes a change in colour when the end-point of a titration is reached. Acid-base indicators are used to signal the end of acid-base titrations. The pH curve for the strong acid-weak base titration shows that phenolphthalein is not a suitable indicator but methyl orange is fine. For the titration of weak acid-strong base, phenolphthalein, but not methyl orange, is a suitable indicator.
