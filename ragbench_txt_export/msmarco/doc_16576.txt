Drumsticks don't take long to cook. Boil them for 30 to 45 minutes then add your vegetables cook for an additional 15 mins. Don't add the vegs until chicken is done or lacking a few minutes of being done. If you put them in while chicken is raw the vegs will cook to mush and have no flavor to them. You want to cook the chicken legs in a pot with enough water to cover them about 2 inches. Bring them to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover the pot, and cook/simmer for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until meat pulls away from bone easily. Pull leg out and set aside to cool.
