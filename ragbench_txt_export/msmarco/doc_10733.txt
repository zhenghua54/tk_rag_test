Conclusion. A variety of Precambrian plant fossils have been documented in rocks as ancient as the Archean (Figure 2). Presently, any specifics about the kind of plants from which these fossilized remains were derived cannot be ascertained. Abstract. Within the global uniformitarian stratigraphic timescale, plant fossils have been found in Precambrian strata dated to approximately 3.5 billion years in age. Evolutionists have not successfully explained when or how life formed to produce these ancient and wide-spread plant fossils.
