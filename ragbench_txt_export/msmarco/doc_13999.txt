The minimum education requirement that a social worker must have in order to work is a bachelorâ€™s degree in social work (BSW). Attaining the degree from an accredited program requires at least 400 hours of supervised field practice. 1 This is another entry-level license reserved for social workers with a bachelor's degree in social work. 2  Like the BSW, typically 2,000 to 3,000 hours of supervised work experience are required.
