Average Cost: The yearly cost to insure your ring is $1 to $2 for every $100 that it would cost to replace. In plain English, this means that if your ring would cost $9,000 to replace, you might expect to pay between $90 and $180 per year to insure itâ€”or slightly more in cities where the risk of theft is higher. Who Needs Ring Insurance Most: Any couple with jewelry that has pricey material or sentimental value. Whether your wedding and engagement rings cost $500 or $50,000, an insurance policy is a way of honoring not just their financial value but what they represent.
