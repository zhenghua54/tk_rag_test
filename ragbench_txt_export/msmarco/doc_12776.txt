Becoming a pharmacist requires years of education and training to obtain the necessary knowledge, skills and certifications. Aspiring pharmacists can spend anywhere between six years (fast-track) to thirteen years completing pre-requisites, Pharm.D coursework, clinical rotations and national exams. 1 Many aspiring pharmacists decide to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree in a lab-related science before making the transition to a Pharm.D program. 2  This option allows for more flexibility upon graduation should a student decide to explore other options in addition to a career as a pharmacist.
