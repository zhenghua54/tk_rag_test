Before we install OS X, we'll need to set up VirtualBox so the OS X install disc can boot correctly. Here's what you need to do: 1  Start up VirtualBox and click the New button. 2  Give your new virtual machine a name (I just called it Mac OS X) and set the operating system to Mac OS X Server (64-bit). 1 After a moment, it'll take you to the OS X Installation screen. 2  Click on your VirtualBox hard drive in the left sidebar, then click the Erase tab in Disk Utility's main pane. 3  Give your drive a name (like Macintosh HD) and click Erase.
