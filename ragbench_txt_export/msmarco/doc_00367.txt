My school-and all schools in the area, actually-do not offer such of a degree. The closest is an associates in math education... which is more like an associates in childhood education, except with an emphasis in mathematics and a deemphasis in education. It doesnt qualify you to do any math field, nor does it qualify you to teach any field.
