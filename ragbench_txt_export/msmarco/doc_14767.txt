If you insert a chart in a spreadsheet and you then insert additional data, the position of the chart changes. This is because the chart is set to move and size with the cells in your document. To lock the position of the chart, you need to edit its properties. Click the Don't move or size with cells radio button to lock the position of the chart, and then click Close to close the Format Chart Area window. Step 5. Press Ctrl-S to save the latest version of the spreadsheet.
