Sounds bad, but in most cars it's fairly straightforward to replace a fuel tank sending unit (also known as the fuel sender). Check your manual, but if your car has a fuel tank sending unit located under the rear seat, where a large percentage of fuel senders are accessible, you're in luck. It's easy! We'll show you how to replace your fuel tank sending unit with ease. It will have a wiring harness plugged into the top (this tells your gas gauge how much fuel is in the tank). Unplug the wiring harness and move it safely to the side. If your fuel tank sending unit is screwed or bolted in place, remove the screws or bolts. Some sending units are a twist-lock type.
