Publisher Summary. This chapter reviews the presentations and most common causes of these neuroendocrine growth disorders, highlighting various gene mutations, endocrine syndromes, and acquired defects that result in states of growth hormone deficiency or excess. Clinically, growth hormone deficiency or defects in its binding to receptor are seen as growth retardation or dwarfism. Conversely, excess secretion of growth hormone prior to fusion of the epiphysial growth plates results in gigantism.
