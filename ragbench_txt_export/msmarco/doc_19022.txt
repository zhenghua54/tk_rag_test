Monetary Policy Committee. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is a committee of the Bank of England, which meets for three and a half days twelve times a year to decide the official interest rate in the United Kingdom (the Bank of England Base Rate). The Committee is responsible for formulating the United Kingdom's monetary policy, most commonly via the setting of the rate at it which it lends to banks (officially the Bank of England Base Rate or BOEBR for short).
