Bank for International Settlements BIS-Salary. Hello Good People of english forum. I am in a bit of a bind and need some advice. The issue is I have the opportunity to work at the bank for international settlements as a senior policy analyst. The problem is I have no idea about Basel nor salary expectations. Re: Bank for International Settlements BIS-Salary. It's tax free because it's not 'in' Switzerland. The buildings are, technically, in foreign territory. As a consequence I've heard that some people face even more complicated issues about what permit is granted. It's also run by the most evil people on the planet..
