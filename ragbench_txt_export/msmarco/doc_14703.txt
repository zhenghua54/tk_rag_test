Answer: First, the terrestrial planets are all in the inner 1.5 AU of the solar system, while the jovian planets are scattered from 5 to 30 AU. Second, the jovian planets are substantially larger in both mass and radius. As we see them today, the asteroids would not make up much of a planet! A single body would have the following size. Use the formula for density: 317 (4/3)5103000 ï€½ R = 20,000 m or 20 km, so the diameter would be 40 km.
