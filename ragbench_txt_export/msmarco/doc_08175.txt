Each plant can grow to between 3 and 6 feet high if you do grow it outside. It will be somewhat smaller if you have to keep it inside. There are 2 kinds of lemongrass: East Indian and West Indian but there is little difference between them in terms of culinary use and growing. While inside, a lemongrass plant needs as much sun as you can offer with a minimum of 6 hours a day. It may thrive as an indoor-only plant but you wonâ€™t get as many stalks from it. Fertilize your container plants once every 2 weeks with a standard mix, though you can skip this during the winter months.
