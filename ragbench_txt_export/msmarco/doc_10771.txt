With proper care, the bruised heel bone symptoms will subside gradually. Complete bruised heel recovery is usually achieved within 1-1Â½ months. Some patients may recover in just 4 weeks, while some may take as long as 3 months to recover. In case of persisting heel pain, one should consult an orthopedist. The health specialist may administer injections to soothe pain. In most of the cases, the associated symptoms of a bruise on the heel of a foot are soreness and inflammation. The person may not be able to move the foot. Being overweight and wearing ill-fitting footwear can contribute to bruised bone symptoms. In general, bruising of the heel bone is not a serious case.
