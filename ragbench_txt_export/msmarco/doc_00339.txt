Any route named as a trail (or way, in the UK) will probably be marked, or identified on a map, but it will usually only be described as long-distance if it takes the average user more than one day to travel from end to end. A number of long distance multi-use trails have been created in England, including three National Trails, the Pennine Bridleway, 192 km (119 miles), The Ridgeway, 139 km (86 miles), and South Downs Way, 160 km (99 miles). Rail trails /paths are shared-use paths that make use of abandoned railway corridors.
