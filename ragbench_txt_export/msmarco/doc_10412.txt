Central Nervous System. Spinal Cord. The spinal cord is composed of grey and white matter (Spinal Cord 1). The grey matter is composed of nerve cell bodies and in a cross-sectional cut appears as a darker stained H-like central area. NERVOUS TISSUE. Nervous tissue is the fourth basic tissue type of the body and is organized into two basic systems: (1) the Central Nervous System (CNS) and (2) the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS). The peripheral system responds to stimuli and sends impulses to the central system (brain and spinal cord)
