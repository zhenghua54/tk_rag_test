The Climate of Grasslands. The two basic types of grasslands are the tall-grassed ones and the short-grassed ones. In grasslands with tall grass, the temperature is moist and humid, allowing for the grass to grow very tall, up to ten feet. The closer to the middle of the country, the dryer it is, meaning that the grass is very short.
