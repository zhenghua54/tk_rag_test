Spinach Sauce. Very common in Italian and Indian dishes, this type of sauce is used as a base for cooking and flavoring dishes with poultry, vegetables, legumes, and pasta. Spinach Sauce may be made as a white creamy sauce or a red, tomato-based sauce. For a white Spinach Sauce, ingredients such as garlic, cheese, fresh or frozen spinach, and seasonings are often combined in a food processor to be blended, but not to the texture of a puree.
