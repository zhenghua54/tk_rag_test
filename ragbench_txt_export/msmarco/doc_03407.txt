Medical tourism, or ‘global healthcare’ as it’s increasingly called, involves travelling to a foreign country for a medical procedure. This industry has been growing rapidly over recent years as more and more people seek faster or cheaper alternatives to the healthcare offered in their own countries. If the treatment is more severe, medical tourism hospitals such as Bumrungrad have accommodations that seem more like a 5-star hotel than a hospital ward. Popular elective medical services include knee or hip joint replacements, cardiac surgery, cosmetic surgery and dental surgery.
