Joining DNA. Most commonly, both donor DNA and vector DNA are digested with the use of a restriction enzyme that produces sticky ends and then mixed in a test tube to allow the sticky ends of vector and donor DNA to bind to each other and form recombinant molecules. MESSAGE. Cloning allows the amplification and recovery of a specific DNA segment from a large, complex DNA sample such as a genome. Inasmuch as the donor DNA was cut into many different fragments, most colonies will carry a different recombinant DNA (that is, a different cloned insert).
