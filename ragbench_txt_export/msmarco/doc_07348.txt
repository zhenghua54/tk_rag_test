Eggs are a good source of protein and they contain all of the essential amino acids, so they provide complete protein. One hard-boiled egg has 6.29 grams of protein, which gives men 11 percent of their daily intake, while women get 14 percent. In a large egg, about 43 percent of the protein is found in the yolk. Even though that percentage will vary based on the size of the yolk, you can count on getting about half of the total amount of protein if you choose to eat only the egg white. One hard-boiled egg has 5.3 grams of total fat and 1.63 grams of saturated fat, which is 47.7 calories in total fat and 14.7 calories in saturated fat.
