Fast Facts: An Easy-to-Read Series of Publications for the Public. Growth plates are located on the long bones of children and young people. These plates are areas of growing tissue near the end of the bones. Each long bone has at least two growth plates-one at each end. This is where the long bones grow. When young people finish growing, the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. Growth plate injuries occur mainly at the wrist, bones of the legs, or in the ankle, foot, or hip bones. The growth plate is the weakest part of the growing skeleton. Injuries to the plates are called fractures. Growth plate fractures happen twice as often in boys as in girls.
