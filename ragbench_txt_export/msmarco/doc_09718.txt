These 2013 salaries are quite a bit higher than the numbers released by Glassdoor last year. In 2012, Google earned the top spot, paying its engineers $128,336 (which is actually $1,193 more than this year). Coming in second was Facebook paying $123,626. Third and fourth place went to Apple and eBay last year. And the unlikely winner is Juniper Networks. Paying $159,990 for its software engineers' average base salary, Juniper is way ahead of other companies on the list. Coming in No. 2 is LinkedIn, which pays its software engineers $136,427, and No. 3 is Yahoo paying $130,312.
