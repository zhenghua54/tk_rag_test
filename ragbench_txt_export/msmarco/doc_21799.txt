Semiotics, or semiology, is the study of signs and symbols, both individually and grouped in sign systems. It includes the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians also sometimes examine how organisms make predictions about and adapt to their semiotic niche in the world (see semiosis). Semiotics is a method to study the use of symbols in language. Every symbol (words, pictures, etc) contains several meanings. These meaning are not fixed, they can change over time and change within the context of other symbols.
