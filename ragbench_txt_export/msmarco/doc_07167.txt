I'll Fly Away was originally written by Albert Brumley in 1929, and since then it's become one of the most covered songs of all time. It's been performed by everyone from Andy Griffith to Kanye West. Today I made a contribution to the continuing BPP series, Best Song in the World Today, with the classic spiritual  I'll Fly Away .. The choice was inspired by the jarring experience of going from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas last weekend.
