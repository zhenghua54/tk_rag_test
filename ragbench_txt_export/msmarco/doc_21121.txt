The rock shrimp (Sicyonia brevirostris) is a deep-water cousin of pink, brown and white shrimps. But due to its hard exoskeleton or shell, it did not have the large market and popularity as its cousins until a machine was invented that would split the tough shell and devein the shrimp. • Rock shrimp cook more quickly than other shrimp. • To boil: Drop in a pot of boiling salted water, stir, and after 35 seconds pour into a colander and rinse with cold water. • To broil: Place 4 inches from the source of heat for 2 minutes or until the meat turns opaque.
