Scleral Contact Lenses. Scleral contact lenses are a specialized type of contact lens used for managing a variety of eye conditions. They are large, and typically their diameter is 18-20mm. This is twice the size of a standard gas permeable contact lens and larger than a typical soft contact lens. Scleral contact lenses are custom made for each eye. They are designed so the lens rests on the less sensitive white sclera, and vaults over the cornea.
