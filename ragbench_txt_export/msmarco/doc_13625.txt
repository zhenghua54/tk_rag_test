Pounds of Bamboo. The diet of giant pandas is all about bamboo, bamboo and more bamboo. These solitary mammals generally eat somewhere between 20 and 40 pounds of it each day, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Bamboo isn't very high in nutrients, and because of that, giant pandas have to eat it in very copious amounts. They're only able to receive roughly 17 percent of the nourishment from the stalks and foliage of bamboo. For a giant panda, a minimum of half the day revolves around bamboo consumption and searching.
