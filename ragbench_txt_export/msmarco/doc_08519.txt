John Adams's birthplace, in Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts, is about ten miles south of Boston. Adams was born in this house on October 30, 1735. Neither of his parents had attended college, but both were readers and provided a good education for their studious son. They sacrificed to send him to Harvard.
