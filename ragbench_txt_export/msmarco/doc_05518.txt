Other states require, for example, that nurse practitioners work under a collaborative agreement with a physician in order to prescribe controlled substances. Muscle relaxers for back pain, nausea medications for vomiting, and migraine meds for headaches. Prescribing is at the core of many nurse practitioner's practice. Unfortunately, the guidelines surrounding this privilege can be difficult to sort through and understand.
