Requirements for claiming a pension. To get a pension, you must have paid contributions for at least four and a half years. To get a pension at the full rate (100%), you must have paid or been credited with at total of 45 years' worth of contributions. If your contribution record is 80% full, you'll be paid 80% of the standard rate of pension.
