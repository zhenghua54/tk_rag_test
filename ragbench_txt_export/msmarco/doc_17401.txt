Street Maintenance Crews made more than 70,000 temporary pothole repairs in fiscal 2010. Tens of thousands per year is not uncommon, especially when we have winters with a lot of freeze-and-thaw cycles and a lot of moisture. The cost of making temporary repairs typically runs from $3 to $9 per pothole. Pothole patching is only a temporary repair.
