Figure 9.6 Impala on the Savanna. (Source: FAO). The Tropical Wet/Dry climate is located on the poleward sides of the tropical wet climates, positioned between them and the tropical dry climates. This location places the climate at an intermediate position between the ITCZ and the Subtropical High. However, the average annual temperature is similar to that of the other tropical wet climates. Mean monthly temperatures in the Tropical Wet/Dry climate range from 18 o C (64.4 o F) to above 25 o C (77 o F).
