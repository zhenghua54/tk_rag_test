The pancreas releases insulin molecules which dock on the cell's membrane. Then, glucose enters the cell by special molecules in the membrane called glucose transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make ATP. That process is done with the Kreb's cycle inside the mitochondria. This ATP is generated with glucose and oxygen (magnesium, CoQ10 and some other helpers).
