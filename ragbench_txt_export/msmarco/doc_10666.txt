A pericardial effusion is an abnormal amount of fluid between the heart and the pericardium, which is the sac surrounding the heart. Pericardial effusions are associated with many different medical conditions. In people with a pericardial effusion that's not due to pericarditis, there are often no symptoms. Large, serious pericardial effusions may cause symptoms including: 1  Shortness of breath. 2  Palpitations (sensation that the heart is pounding or beating fast). 3  Light-headedness or passing out. 4  Cool, clammy skin.
