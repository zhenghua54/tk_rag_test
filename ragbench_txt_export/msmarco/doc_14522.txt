The death of Joan of Arc would be conducted, with Joan of Arc at the stake, on May 30, 1431. She was tied to a tall pillar in the Vieux-Marche in Rouen, where she asked two of the clergy present to hold a crucifix before her. When Joan of Arc burned at the stake, witnesses said she met it with composure and bravery, causing many to feel that there was a horrible injustice against this young woman. After Joan of Arc died, the English raked the coals and ashes to expose her charred body to show that she had not escaped alive.
