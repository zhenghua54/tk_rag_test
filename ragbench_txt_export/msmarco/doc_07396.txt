Our bathroom contruction cost calculator estimates the cost of bathrooms by adding labour costs to the cost of fittings. Labour includes the cost of installing waterproofing, plumbing, tiling, electrical items, gyprocking, painting and the installation of fittings. The per-square-metre cost for labour that we use is $1100 for a new home and $1600 for a renovation (renovations require the old bathroom to be gutted). We obtained these values by getting prices from various bathroom installation specialists and then taking an average. If your project is a bathroom 'makeover', rather than a full renovation, this calculator can help you estimate the cost of new fittings.
