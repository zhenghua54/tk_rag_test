A subsidy is a grant or monetary gift given by a private person or entity (often a government) to another private person or entity, as financial assistance or to help launch an enterprise. Examples of subsidies include welfare, farm subsidies, and certain aspects of student loans. A subsidy normally exemplifies the opposite of a tax, but can also be given using a reduction of the tax burden. These kinds of subsidy are generally called tax expenditures.
