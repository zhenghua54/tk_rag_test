Hollandaise Sauce. A sauce made with egg yolks that are beaten as they are warmed slightly. Butter is gradually added along with lemon juice to create a thick, creamy sauce. Hollandaise sauce is used to accompany egg dishes, boiled or poached fish, and a variety of vegetables. In French cooking, brown sauces serve as a base for other similar sauces that are used as an accompaniment for meats and vegetables. Brown sauces are made from a brown meat stock and thickened with cornstarch or roux (flour cooked with butter).
