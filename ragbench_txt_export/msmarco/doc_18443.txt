Milonguero is a style of close-embrace tango dancing, the name coined by Susana Miller and Oscar Cacho Dante from the Argentine word milonguero. In the milonguero-style embrace, the woman moves her left hand past her partner's right shoulder (where it would be in open embrace) around his neck and back to end up near his left shoulder, depending on the relative heights of the dancers.
