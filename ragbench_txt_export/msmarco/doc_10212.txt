As they get into their senior years, you may want to make that twice a year. It's great you want to take the best care possible of your dogs, but it does get expensive so maybe take that money you would have spent on regular checkups every two to three months and save it in an emergency fund for your dogs care. My old guy actually hardly went to the vet once a year, more like whenever he needed his vaccines updated.. Then again, he was always a freakishly healthy dog until the tooth. That's another thing, just a word of advice: take care of their teeth.
