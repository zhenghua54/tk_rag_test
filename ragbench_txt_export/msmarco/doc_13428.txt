Recently I joined a Avaaz petition as a result of having it forwarded to me by a friend. Today I received an email asking for money. They say they have 6.5 million members and are growing by 60,000 per week. Even ASIO don't have a law which stipulates an employee can't sign their own name to a petition. There is Govt policy that states we cannot be associated with out department in a personal capacity in those situations but beyond that it's all fine.
