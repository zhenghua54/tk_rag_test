The major muscle groups of the lower body are the quadriceps, hamstrings (biceps femoris and semitendinosus), gluteus, gastrocnemius and soleus. The quadriceps form the front part of your upper leg, many people refer to them as thigh muscles. These muscles are used for motions such as walking or kicking a ball. The first of these groups is collectively known as the abdominal muscles. Abdominal muscles, or abs, are found overtop your stomach. In the diagram below, you'll notice these muscles forming the midsection of the body's front side.
