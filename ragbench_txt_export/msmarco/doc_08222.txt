The nervous system has three general functions: a sensory function, an interpretative function and a motor function. 1  Sensory nerves gather information from inside the body and the outside environment. 2  The nerves then carry the information to central nervous system (CNS). The nervous system is divided into two parts: 1  the central nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord. 2  the peripheral system which connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body.
