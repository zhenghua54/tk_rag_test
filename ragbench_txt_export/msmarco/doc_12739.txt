Plenty of apps (except Amazon): The Apple TV used to get a lot of flak for its limited app support, but it's done a much better job recently, adding high-quality services like HBO Go and Watch ESPN. Aside from Amazon Instant, pretty much every major video app is now available on Apple TV. For bargain hunters the cheaper Roku Streaming Stick is nearly as good, and the Google Chromecast is so cheap it's almost an impulse purchase. Meanwhile Apple TV and Fire TV have plenty of good points, particularly if you've already bought a lot of music, movies or TV shows from Apple or Amazon.
