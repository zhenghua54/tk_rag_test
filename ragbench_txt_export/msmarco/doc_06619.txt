A polyamide is a macromolecule with repeating units linked by amide bonds. Polyamides occur both naturally and artificially. Examples of naturally occurring polyamides are proteins, such as wool and silk. Artificially made polyamides can be made through step-growth polymerization or solid-phase synthesis yielding materials such as nylons, aramids, and sodium poly(aspartate) . Synthetic polyamides are commonly used in textiles, automotive applications, carpets and sportswear due to their high durability and strength. For the industrial production of synthetic polyamides with at least one aliphatic monomer (nylon polymers), the amide link is produced from the condensation reaction of an amino group and a carboxylic acid group, water is eliminated. For fully aromatic polyamides or 'aramids' e.g.
