Thank You for your help. Â· just now. Report Abuse. Insurance follows the car and where the car is parked. If you own the car, you can insure it, but if your friend has no ownership in the car, he has no vested interest. Does your friend live with you, if he does, then you will need to add to your insurance policy as a listed driver.
