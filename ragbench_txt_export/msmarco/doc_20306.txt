There are over 700 different types of igneous rocks. Examples of igneous rocks include basalt, granite, pumice, obsidian, tuff, diorite, gabbro and andesite. Basalt forms the metamorphic rock granulite when subjected to extreme heat and pressure over time (metamorphism). Tuff is a rock formed from volcanic ash. The upper section of the Earth's crust is made up of around 95% igneous rock. Learn about sedimentary rocks, metamorphic rocks, other rocks and minerals or fossils.
