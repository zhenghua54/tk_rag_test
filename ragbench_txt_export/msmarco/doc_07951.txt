Golden parachutes are contracts given to key executives and can be used as a type of antitakeover measure taken by a firm to discourage an unwanted takeover attempt. Benefits include items such as stock options, cash bonuses, generous severance pay or any combination of these benefits. Golden parachute clauses can be used to define the lucrative benefits that an employee would receive in the event he or she is terminated; however, the term often relates to terminations that result from a takeover or merger.
