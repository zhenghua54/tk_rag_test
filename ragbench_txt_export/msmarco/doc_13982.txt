Best Answer: depends on the quality of paint job you want. You can get one as cheap as $500. It will not last long and they will not do any prep work other than wash it and tape it off. It will look fine from a few feet away. If it is a beater car that you will not have long, this is a good option. Rating Newest Oldest.
