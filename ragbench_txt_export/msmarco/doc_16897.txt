Pictorial drawing. A view of an object (actual or imagined) as it would be seen by an observer who looks at the object either in a chosen direction or from a selected point of view. Pictorial sketches often are more readily made and more clearly understood than are front, top, and side views of an object. 1). Oblique pictorial drawings, while not true orthographic views, offer a convenient method for drawing circles and other curves in their true shape (Fig. 2). In order to reduce the distortion in an oblique drawing, measurements along the receding axis may be foreshortened.
