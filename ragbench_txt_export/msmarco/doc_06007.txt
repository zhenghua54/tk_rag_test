Galvanization is the process by which zinc is coated over corrosive (easily rusted) metals. Galvanizing involves coating corrosive metals, such as steel and iron, with a non-corrosive metal. The process of galvanizing, not only protects from corrosion of various ‘soft metals’ but also adds strength of the original, uncoated metal. 1 Electro-Galvanizing: It is an electrolytic process for galvanizing, where a thinner, tighter bonding coat of zinc is applied to a metal through “electroplating”. 2  Electro plating is a process of running a current of electricity through a saline/ zinc solution with a zinc anode and steel conductor.
