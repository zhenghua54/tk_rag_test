Offer and acceptance analysis is a traditional approach in contract law used to determine whether an agreement exists between two parties. An offer is an indication by one person to another of their willingness to contract on certain terms without further negotiations. A contract is said to come into existence when acceptance of an offer has been communicated to the offeror by the offeree. The offer and acceptance formula, developed in the 19th century, identifies a moment of formation when the parties are of one mind.
