1 Place the broiler pan 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) under the top heating element of the oven. 2  Carefully turn the chicken over after 10 minutes pass. 3  Brush this side with oil and continue cooking an additional 10 minutes. 4  Thick thighs or bone-in thighs may need to be cooked for a total of 25 to 35 minutes, instead. 1 If you are unsure of how much salt and pepper to use, start with roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) black pepper. 2  Use a basting brush to brush the olive oil over the chicken for a more thorough coating. 3  The oil helps the chicken to stay moist and to brown in the oven.
