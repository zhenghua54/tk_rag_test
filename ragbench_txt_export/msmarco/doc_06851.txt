Glowstone is a Vanilla block, used as an alternative to torches. This block can only be found naturally in the Nether. It generates on the undersides of Netherrack, and forms unusual coral-like stalactites. Glowstone can be difficult to harvest, due to high ceilings, sheer cliffs and abundance of lava in the Nether. However, you cannot place anything on glowstone except blocks and redstone, meaning torches, doors, etc. cannot be placed on it. When placing redstone on a glowstone block it can send power down but not up the block, since there is a glitch because it is registered in the coding as glass.
