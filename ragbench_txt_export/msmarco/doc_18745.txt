Epilobium parviflorum has been used for a long time as a medicinal plant for the treatment of various prostate symptoms, like prostate adenoma and associated disorders. Epilobii herba, willow herb, has not been officially recognized by any of European pharmacopoeias. Epilobium Parviflorum has an inflammation-inhibiting and healing effect on acute and chronic inflammation of the prostate and can help to reduce the gland to its normal size. It is recommended that all men over the age of 50 take this herb regularly as a preventative and to maintain prostate and bladder health.
