The House Budget Committee's budget plan would convert the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cut funding steeply -- by $125 billion (34 percent) between 2021 and 2025. The plan's only specific reference to the SNAP cut argues that: Federal spending for food stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), has increased from $21 billion in 2002 to $76 billion in 2014. Spending is forecast to be permanently higher than pre-recession levels even as the job-market recovers.
