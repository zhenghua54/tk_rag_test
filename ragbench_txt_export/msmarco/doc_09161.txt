Epiglottitis is a medical emergency that may result in death if not treated quickly. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that sits at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the trachea (windpipe) during swallowing. When it becomes infected and inflamed, it can swell and obstruct or close off the windpipe, which may be fatal unless promptly treated. 1 Epiglottitis occurs with different peaks in both children and adults. 2  In children, generally epiglottitis typically peaks in children aged 2-4 years. 3  In adults, the average age of onset is 45 years.
