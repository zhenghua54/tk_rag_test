Cis-(+)-sertraline hydrochloride form-II is obtained from cis-(+)-sertraline mandelate by conversion of mandelate salt to cis-(+)-sertraline base and further dissolving base in a solvent and reacting with hydrogen chloride. The process does not need any seeding. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION. The present invention discloses a novel method for the preparation of racemic sertraline starting from the known tetralone and cis(+) sertraline hydrochloride form II from cis(+) sertraline mandelate.
