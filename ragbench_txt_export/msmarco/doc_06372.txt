Background: Survival rates of ex­treme­ly premature infants have been rising over the last 20 years. Because there is great variation in survival for newborns delivered at 22 to 25 weeks’ gestational age (GA), management guidelines are needed. Background. Initiating resuscitation and intensive care for preterm infants is generally accepted from 26 weeks’ gestational age (GA) on.[ 1 ]-[ 3 ] By contrast, initial resuscitation and management of the extremely preterm infant born at 22 to 25 weeks’ GA is controversial.
