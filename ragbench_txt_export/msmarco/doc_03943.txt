At the far southeast corner of Texas lies a remote and unique coastal park. Sea Rim State Park has 5.2 miles of Gulf shoreline and 4,000 acres of marshlands. At this park, you can camp, go birding and beach combing, paddle in a canoe or kayak, swim, fish, hunt (in season), and walk. You do not need a license to fish from shore in a state park. We also have a boat ramp. Download Sea Rim's Fishing Tip Sheet. Paddle one of our trails, from the 1.79-mile easy trail to the 9.59-mile advanced trail. Experience the coast from a kayak or canoe (bring your own).
