What records your organisation needs to keep. You have to keep sufficient records to calculate the income, expenses and GST liability of your organisation, and to enable us to confirm your accounts if necessary. The records you must keep are: 1  receipt and payment account books. 2  bank statements. 3  invoices (including GST tax invoices). 4  receipts. For GST you do not need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50, but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount.
