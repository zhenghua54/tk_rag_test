If you own a home, you can claim up to a $1,500 credit on your income taxes for installing qualified energy-efficient appliances. The amount of credit you receive depends on how much you spent on energy-efficient appliances. The tax credit is 30 percent of the total cost of the energy-efficient appliance, including any installation costs.
