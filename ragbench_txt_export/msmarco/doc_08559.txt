Calf muscle strains can also developed due to repetitive overuse of the calf muscles usually with running and jumping, especially if the muscles are weak or tight. Pulled calf muscles are the most common cause of calf pain in runners. Other common terms for the condition include a calf muscle strain or torn calf muscle. Essentially, what all these terms refer to is when the calf muscles are pulled beyond their normal elastic limit, overstretching them and damaging some or all of muscle fibres.
