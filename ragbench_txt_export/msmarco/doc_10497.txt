The invention being patented is essentially the genetic information itself. Usually the publication of a patent allows other inventors to build on an invention, seeing what works and what doesn't, working with other materials, etc. I think companies shouldn’t be able to patent human genes. First of all its your genes, your cells you own that. Companies shouldn’t just take something from you without your consent of it.
