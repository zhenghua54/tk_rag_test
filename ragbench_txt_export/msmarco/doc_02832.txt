In a radionic assessment the aim is not to categorize a condition by way of a diagnostic term but to find out ALL the factors that have contributed to the clinical presentations of the patient. Such factors could reside in the body physical, the etheric body, the emotional body, or the mental body. The particular form of ESP used in Radionics is often referred to as the radiesthetic faculty through which the practitioner, by means of a series of posed yes/no questions, obtains information. about the health of his patients to which the conscious thinking mind has no direct access.
