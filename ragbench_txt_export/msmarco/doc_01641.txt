Last November the International Maritime organisation banned the use of tributyltin or TBT and organic compound that's used in anti-fouling paint on ships. The ban starts on 2003 and all TBT based paints are to be phased out by 2008. John Lewis: Anti-fouling paints were first introduced in the middle of the last century and copper was the main biocide at that time. With even the advances over the successive century, the longest life you would get out of a copper based paint was to the order of 12 to 18 months.
