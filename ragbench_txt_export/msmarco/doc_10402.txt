Basal metabolic rate (BMR), also called the resting metabolic rate, is the amount of energy needed to support the body's most basic functions when at rest in a neutral, or non-stressful, environment. The BMR is the number of calories a specific human needs per day to stay alive. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body burns daily without your having to do anything. Your body uses around 75 percent of the calories you eat each day just to maintain life and perform basic functions.
