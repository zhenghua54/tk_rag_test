The riparian brush rabbit, Sylvilagus bachmani riparius, is 1 of 13 subspecies of the brush rabbit, 8 of which are found in California. Riparian brush rabbits feed at the edges of shrub cover rather than in large openings. Their diet consists of herbaceous vegetation, such as grasses, sedges, clover, forbs, and buds, bark, and leaves of woody plants. One preferred plant is green clover (Trifolium wormskiolodii).
