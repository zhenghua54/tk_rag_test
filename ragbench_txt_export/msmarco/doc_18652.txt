I f you triple this, your consulting fee should be about $120 an hour. (Or $39.06 x 3 = $117.18, rounded to $120 per hour.). I recommend rounding up to the nearest $5 or $10 multiple, because a $78/hr or $117 fee looks odd. To set a daily rate, simply multiply the hours you work in a day by the hourly rate from the above example. 8 hours * $80 hourly rate = $640 per day. 3. Setting Consultant Fees by the Project. Some consultants set their rates by the project.
