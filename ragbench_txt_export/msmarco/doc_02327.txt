People who are lactose intolerant are missing the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. As a result, lactose-intolerant patients are unable to digest these foods, and may experience symptoms such as nausea, cramps, gas, bloating and diarrhea. 1 Many non-dairy products contain casein (a milk derivative), listed on the ingredient labels. 2  Some specialty products made with milk substitutes (i.e., soy-, nut-or rice-based dairy products) are manufactured on equipment shared with milk. 3  Some meats may contain casein as a binder. 4  Check all labels carefully.
