Larry has definitely influenced Prince's bass playing. But, the vintage Prince, the quintessential Prince will always be remembered as an amalgamation of primarily Sly Stone, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown. Of course there were many more in there but I think it's fair to say those are the major ones. He was also influenced by Elvis, Santana, Little Richard and many many more.
