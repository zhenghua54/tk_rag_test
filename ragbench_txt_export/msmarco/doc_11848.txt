GAA It is calculated by dividing the number of minutes played by 60 minutes(one game) then dividing the goals against by that answer. It is typically given to two decimal places. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_Again... Say that season, in 10 games, I allowed 51 goals in 395 minutes (it's roller hockey, so it's going to be higher in my example, apply your stats as appropriate): (45/395) x 51 = 5.81 GAA You will need to know minutes and seconds and convert to a decimal to do this accurately.
