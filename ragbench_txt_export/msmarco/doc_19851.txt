Why PET scans are used. An advantage of a PET scan is that it can show how well certain parts of your body are working, rather that showing what it looks like. They're particularly helpful for investigating confirmed cases of cancer, to determine how far the cancer has spread and how well it's responding to treatment. Introduction. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are used to produce detailed three-dimensional images of the inside of the body. The images can clearly show the part of the body being investigated, including any abnormal areas, and can highlight how well certain functions of the body are working.
