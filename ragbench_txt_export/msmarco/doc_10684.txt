Dr. Jeff Young, of the new hit show Dr. Jeff: Rocky Mountain Vet, will premiere tonight on Animal Planet. Animal Planet is one of the leading television stations that continuously provides excellent programming related to animals, such as the recently aired show Cannibal In The Jungle. Animal Planet fans will get to see the long-haired vet work his magic on the animals. Some of the scenes on the new Animal Planet reality show will be graphic and gruesome as they show animals that are suffering a great deal from wounds and illness.
