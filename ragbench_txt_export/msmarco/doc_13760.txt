- Add/edit synced outlook.com contacts in the phone book on my Android phone by using the HTC built-in phone book. If I try to add new contacts in the phone, my only options are to add to my phone or to a Gmail account only. - I'm using Outlook.com app on my Android, HTC Incredible S. - No error. Note: If I click edit contact, the Edit option would appear for 2 seconds and disappear. Leaving me to view only. The way this works is when you choose to add a new contact from People (the address book that came with my android), you can choose to use the contact editor and then you can choose to create the contact under my outlook.com account. This works, but is not really elegant.
