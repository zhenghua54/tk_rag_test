1 Do-it-yourselfers intent on completely refinishing a 225-square-foot floor can rent a commercial sander, also called a drum sander, and buy other needed materials for about $125-$225. 2  Renting a floor buffer and buying needed supplies recoating runs $50-$100. 3  These costs go up the longer it takes to finish the project. 1 Typically this takes about a day or two, and restores a floor that's in relatively good condition. 2  Expect to pay $340-$900 (about $1.50-$4 a square foot) to completely refinish a 15x15 foot room. 3  That generally includes sanding down to the bare wood and applying at least 2 and sometimes 3 coats of finish.
