In Hindu astrology, Mangal Dosha is an astrological combination that occurs if Mars (Mangal) is in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house of the ascendant chart. A person born in the presence of this condition is termed a manglik. Reality: There is only one planet Mars and hence, one can be either a manglik or not.Neither is there less, medium or high level of dosha. Manglik and Karma. Most Indian religions are based on the ‘Karma’ theory and clearly state that no one can escape the results of their own karma.
