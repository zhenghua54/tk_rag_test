Growing Lemongrass Outside. Lemongrass is actually a tropical plant, so those of you who have warm weather year round can easily grow lemon-grass plants as part of your landscape. In ideal conditions lemon grass will reach 3 to 6-foot high and do double-duty as a decorative ornamental grass. Lemongrass prefers full sun and some room. A mature plant can reach 6 feet in height and be up to 40 inches wide. It wants a well-drained, loamy soil, so make sure you don’t have heavy clay, or that water does not stand in the area you’re planting.
