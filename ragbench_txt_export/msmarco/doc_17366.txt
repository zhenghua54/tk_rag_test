In the anime, Satomi has short, maroon hair with her hair tied up in the front. She has brown eyes. In the manga, she has short, dark hair with a fringe in the front. She is considerably attractive (this is known because other people have feelings for her which causes Shinichi to get into fights). Background Edit. A young Satomi is shown to approach Shinichi during the results of their high school entrance exams, after he found out that he was accepted. A brief misunderstanding happened between the two of them when she thought that Shinichi wasn't the person she thought him to be.
