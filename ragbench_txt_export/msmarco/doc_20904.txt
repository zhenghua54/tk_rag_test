Tas on 11/10/2013 - 13:08 Â¶. Sorry to hear about the fire-related mess. No idea of costs involved, but just be really aware, in my opinion, and given how rife is the problem with lax home renovators and demolition contractors-as regards asbestos removal-that you have some grave moral responsibilities in play here. We have a rental property (house) that was damaged by fire and now needs to be demolished before we sell it. (Agent said we get a higher price this way.). The structure of the house is basically sound except for the hole in the roof but the kitchen, bathroom and living room's ceiling and walls are all damaged.
