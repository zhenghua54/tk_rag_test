The poem and poppy are prominent Remembrance Day symbols throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, particularly in Canada, where In Flanders Fields is one of the nation's best-known literary works. The poem also has wide exposure in the United States, where it is associated with Memorial Day. In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, named after the poem and devoted to the First World War, is situated in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas. Despite its enduring fame, In Flanders Fields is often ignored by academics teaching and discussing Canadian literature.
