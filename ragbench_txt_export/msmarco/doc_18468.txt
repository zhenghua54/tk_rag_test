If the transplant does not work at the start, dialysis will be required and the patient will need to play a waiting game until the kidney starts working. A ‘good transplant’ is one that is working well after one year, not two weeks. In about one third of kidney transplants, the kidney does not produce any urine in the first few days (and sometimes weeks) after the transplant. This does not mean that the transplant will never work.
