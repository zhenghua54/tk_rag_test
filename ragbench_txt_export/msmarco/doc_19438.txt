Put them on the bottom of the crock of the slow cooker, turn the heat to high, and cover. Let the pork cook on high while preparing the greens, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the greens by washing thoroughly, cutting out the center stem, then cutting into 1 pieces. Rinse again and drain well. Add the greens to the slow cooker along with the remaining ingredients. Turn the slow cooker to low and cook 4-6 hours or until the greens are tender and are a gray-green color. Remove the salt pork before serving. If you're in a hurry, the greens may be cooked on high for 3-4 hours; stir every hour or so
