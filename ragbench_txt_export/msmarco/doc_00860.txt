School does prepare you for the future. School prepares you for the future because it teaches you how to become an everyday worker. Think of it this way, your boss doesn't want you slacking and not doing your work in a everyday environment. No it does not.

Honestly they should be teaching us how to balance a checkbook, pay taxes, pay the bills and all that other stuff. And what doesn't help with all of this is common core.
