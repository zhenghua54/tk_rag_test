Profit comes from leasing these drill rigs at contracted day rates that exceed the company's cost of capital and operating costs. The offshore drilling companies are leveraged to long term price trends of oil. It is often stated that the break-even for deepwater drilling is oil over $70 a barrel. The reason it matters is because day rates and operating costs are vastly different. Day rates are typically $75,000 per day for jackups, and $400,000 or more a day for deepwater (rates vary widely, based on market conditions and rig availability).
