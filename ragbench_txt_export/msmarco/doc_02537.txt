Anxiety is the faulty activation of your fight or flight system at times when there is no fear causing stimuli present. When anxiety hits, it automatically changes behaviors in the sense that it prepares your body to fight or run away by increasing your heart rate, causing sweating, etc. Compulsions. The strangest behaviors caused by anxiety are most likely compulsions. Compulsions affect those with obsessive compulsive disorder, and they're behaviors that a person does compulsively to rid themselves of their negative, anxiety producing thoughts.
