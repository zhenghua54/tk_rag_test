The planet that can be closest to Earth when we're both in the same part of our orbits is Venus. The minimum distance between us and Venus is about 25.5 million miles, or about 28% of the distance from earth to the sun. ======================================. While we're on the subject, this is also a good time to mention Mars. After Venus, Mars is the next nearest planet to Earth. So the distance between Earth and any other planet changes over a wide range, depending on whether we're both on the same side of the sun or on opposite sides. At any given time, the planet closest to Earth could be either Mercury, Venus, or Mars.
