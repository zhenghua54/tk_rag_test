Modular programming is closely related to structured programming and object-oriented programming, all having the same goal of facilitating construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces, and all originating around the 1960s. Furthermore, the term package has other uses in software. A component is a similar concept, but typically refers to a higher level; a component is a piece of a whole system, while a module is a piece of an individual program.
