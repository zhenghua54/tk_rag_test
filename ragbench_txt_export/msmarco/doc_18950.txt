Vinegar Douche. Female yeast infections can be treated using either white or apple cider vinegar in a douche. Vinegar should never be used by itself and should always be mixed in water to avoid irritating delicate vaginal tissue. Infants can even get yeast infections as diaper rashes. At-home treatments for yeast infections are available as over-the-counter products in drugstores, and home remedies using products as simple as household vinegar have been shown to be effective in eliminating yeast infections.
