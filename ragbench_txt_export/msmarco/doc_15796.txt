Advantages of RCI Points. RCI Points operates as an exchange program but with advantages that the traditional week-for-week program does not provide. The points act as a type of vacation currency, with certain levels of points needed to vacation at corresponding resorts. Through the development of the RCI Points program, RCI-affiliated resorts were offered the opportunity to convert their weeks-based owners into RCI Points, while also giving new owners the chance to purchase timeshare at the resort and receive RCI Points back as their ownership product.
