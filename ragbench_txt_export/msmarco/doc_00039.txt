Colonies are moderate to large in size and may contain several Queen ants. Ghost ant colonies may contain bits of dead but moist grass and plant stems. Nests are typically found in cavities of decaying plant matter under loose bark, under rocks or other objects on the ground, and even in flowerpots. 1 If ants are seen inside, use a vacuum cleaner to get rid of them. 2  Exclusion: to prevent the entry of Ghost ants, install tight-fitting doors, door sweeps, windows, and screens. 3  Use caulking to secure cracks and leakages in doors and windows.
