Texas Speeding Ticket Cost. The fine for a Texas speeding ticket starts at $120.00 for 5mph over and there is a graduated scale up to $185.00 for 25mph over. Above 25mph you have to contact the court. Some courts may also be allowed to add surcharges so the only way to know exactly is to contact the clerk of court.
