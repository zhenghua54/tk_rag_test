If you've bought frozen shrimp in their original packaging, the packaging will often have a Use-by or Best before date on it. That's the vendor's estimate of how long your shrimp will retain their best flavor and quality. Usually it will be 4 to 6 months for uncooked shrimp, or about half that for cooked. You can still eat them after that time -- they'll be safe for as long as they stay properly frozen -- but their texture will suffer, they'll begin to acquire off-flavors from the freezer, and eventually they'll succumb to freezer burn. Tip. For the longest storage life, keep your shrimp in a chest freezer rather than a refrigerator freezer. The relatively small freezer compartment in your fridge warms up quickly whenever you open it and takes time to return to its usual 0 degrees Fahrenheit.
