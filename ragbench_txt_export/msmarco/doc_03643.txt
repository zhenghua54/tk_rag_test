Empirically, the over-representation of extremely tall athletes in basketball lends credence to the theory that the sport provides tall players with a very significant advantage. The average American male is 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 99% are 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) or shorter. In rowing, tallness is advantageous, because the taller a rower is, the longer his or her stroke can potentially be, thus moving the boat more effectively. The average male Olympic rower is 1.92 m (6 ft 3 1‚ÅÑ2 in), and the average female Olympic rower is 1.73 m (5 ft 8 in), well over the average height.
