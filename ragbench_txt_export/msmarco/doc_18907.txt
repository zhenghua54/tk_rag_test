Cortisone Injection: What to Expect. You have just received a cortisone injection. Most people feel relief right away, but it can take up to 48 to 72 hours to experience relief. The injection can last several weeks, although this varies from patient to patient. After you receive the injection, move the area around for a few minutes (i.e. massage, moving shoulder in circles, bending knee back and forth) to disperse the medication.
