Funding ongoing Medicaid programs is one of the greatest challenges for states. In governors’ proposed budgets for fiscal 2012, cost containment in Medicaid is a dominant theme. Medicaid spending is estimated at $354 billion in fiscal 2010, according to NASBO’s 2009 State Expenditure Report. As a result, Medicaid surpassed elementary and secondary education as the largest component of total state spending for the first time since 2006 based on estimated fi scal 2010 spending data.
