Specialized lymph capillaries are associated with the vili of the small intestine. These vessels are called lacteals because the lipid they transport makes the lymph look milky. This fluid is called chyle. The lymphatic organs are the red bone marrow, the thymus gland, lymph nodes, lymph nodules, and the spleen.
