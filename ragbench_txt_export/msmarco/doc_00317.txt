Another word of caution that you need to consider is there are many companies that sell shelf corporations that have done business in the past, DO NOT buy these! If a shelf corporation has done business in the past and you purchase it you also assume all past liabilities of that company. There are bank ratings, credit history, NSF history, and other factors to consider especially if you request more than a $50k line of credit. So if your interest is in applying for bank financing keep in mind shelf corporations have no business history, tax returns, financials and existing revenue.
