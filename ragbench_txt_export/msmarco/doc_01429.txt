Contrary to popular opinion, rhubarb plants do NOT become poisonous after flowering starts. The leaf stalks can still be cut and used and the leaves themselves should be discarded (composted) as they are always poisonous. photo credit. When you remove the flow stalks be sure to remove the complete stalk. These stalks don't pull off as easily as the leave stalks do, so you may need to use a knife. Cut the flower stalk off cleanly as close to the main plant as possible.
