Lesson Summary. In summary, oogenesis is the process by which the female gametes, or ova, are created. The female gamete is called an ovum. The diploid germ cells that have the potential to develop into ova are called oogonia. In this lesson, you'll learn how the human body produces an ovum through the process of oogenesis. You'll also learn how polar bodies help to ensure that female gametes are of high quality even though they are not produced in high quantities.
