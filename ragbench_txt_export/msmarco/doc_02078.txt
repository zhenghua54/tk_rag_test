Background. Respiratory alkalosis is a disturbance in acid and base balance due to alveolar hyperventilation. Alveolar hyperventilation leads to a decreased partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2). Respiratory alkalosis can be acute or chronic. In acute respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal and the serum pH is alkalemic. In chronic respiratory alkalosis, the PaCO 2 level is below the lower limit of normal, but the pH level is relatively normal or near normal.
