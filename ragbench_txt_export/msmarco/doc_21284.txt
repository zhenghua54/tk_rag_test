Records for tax deductions taken. Length of time to keep, and why: Seven years. 1  The IRS has three years from your filing date to audit your return if it suspects good-faith errors. 2  The three-year deadline also applies if you discover a mistake in your return and decide to file an amended return to claim a refund.
