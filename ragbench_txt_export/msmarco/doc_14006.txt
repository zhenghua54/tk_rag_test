Almost every organism you can see without a microscope -- and some microscopic organisms as well -- are examples of eukaryotes. Eukaryotes have many cellular characteristics that distinguish them from prokaryotes like bacteria. For example, all eukaryotes have complex organelles, including a cytoskeleton, a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus and chloroplasts. They also have relatively large cells, generally much larger than bacterial cells
