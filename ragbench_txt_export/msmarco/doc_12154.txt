A: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a medication that is used to treat fluid retention and high blood pressure. It is classified as a thiazide diuretic (water pill) that helps the kidneys remove more salt and water from the bloodstream, which will decrease the blood volume and reduce blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide may also be prescribed to treat calcium-containing kidney stones because it decreases the amount of calcium excreted by the kidneys in the urine, thus reducing the amount of calcium available to form stones.
