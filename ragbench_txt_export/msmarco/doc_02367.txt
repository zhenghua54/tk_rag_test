That's a great size for CD10 and you can expect them both to ovulate together. With clomid expect follicles to grow 1-3mm per day. Average is prob 3mm jump every 2 days. You are looking at triggering around CD 14-16 which is typical for clomid taken CD 5-7. If you had taken it CD 3-5 you would have been earlier.
