Rangoli is an ancient ephemeral artform practiced throughout India. Designs are drawn onto the ground, usually in chalk or colored powder and embellished with sand, rice, candles or flower petals. Rangoli is an expression of the creative self, often viewed as a form of self-portraiture. Designs are composed of geometric and curvilinear patterns, usually derived from nature. After the Rangoli is complete, the image is simply allowed to blow away with the wind â€“ serving as a metaphor for the impermanence of life
