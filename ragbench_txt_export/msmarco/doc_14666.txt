Non-renewable resources such as oil and coal will eventually run out, whereby it will stop providing us with energy. Renewable resources, on the other hand, will not run out. Examples like sunlight, wind, tree,water etc. can be used to provide us with energy as well after non-renewable resources have been exhausted.
