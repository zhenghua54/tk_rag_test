The topology or mode you choose depends on whether you want your PCs to communicate directly or with an access point. Wireless networks that use an access point are in infrastructure mode (Figure 3.4). Figure 3.4. More common than an ad-hoc network, an infrastructure network includes an access point. An infrastructure network enables you to: Connect to a wired network.
