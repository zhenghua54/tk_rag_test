Mortgage insurance costs can be reduced if you manage to get the insurance removed early. For example, if the insurance on a 95% fixed-rate mortgage is removed in 5 years but you stay with the mortgage for 10, the cost falls to 10.8%. However, if you move in 5 years and pay off the mortgage, there is no saving. The cost calculation above assumes that you take a fixed-rate mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of 95%, and pay mortgage insurance for 10 years. Change the assumptions and you change the cost. For example: *On 85% and 90% loans, the cost is 13.4% and 12.5%, respectively.
