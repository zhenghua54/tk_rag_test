A loan payable charges interest, and is usually based on the earlier receipt of a certain sum of cash from a lender. As an example of a loan payable, a business obtains a loan of $100,000 from a third party lender and records it with a debit to the cash account and a credit to the loan payable account. Definition: A loan is an arrangement under which the owner of property (usually cash) allows another party the use of the property in exchange for an interest payment and the return of the property at the end of the lending arrangement.
