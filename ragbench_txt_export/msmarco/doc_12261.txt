How to Attract Frogs. The best way to attract frogs is to find out what kind of habitat your native frogs like and try to recreate that habitat in your yard. You may be able to get information on native frog species from your state or provincial wildlife or natural resources department. However, the best way to share your garden with frogs is to simply build a frog-friendly pond. Re-creating their natural habitat is the best way to attract frogs (toads are good too) and keep them from wandering off in search of more frog-friendly surroundings.
