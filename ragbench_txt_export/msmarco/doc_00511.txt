Moringa Tea: Nutritious Energy Drink! The Moringa oleifera tea is an excellent energy drink. The tea is loaded with antioxidants and vitamins that will help clear your mind and boost energy levels. You can prepare a tea by steeping a handful of dry leaves in hot water for a few minutes. To make Moringa tea you should harvest fresh leaves from your tree and dry them at room temperature. Place the leaves in a brown paper bag with some holes in it and hang the bag in a cool area of your home. In about 10-14 days your leaves should be dry enough to use. To make the tea, shred or pulverize the leaves.
