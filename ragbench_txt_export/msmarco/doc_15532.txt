I've had a mouth ulcer on the side of my bottom lip for about 3 days. It gets to the point I can't eat or drink ANYTHING without the substance bothering it. I can't even enjoy my birthday dinner tomorrow because it'll be so painful. I've had an ulcer at the bottom of my gum on the left hand side, its white grey and red, my lip gets rather inflamed and leaves a redish rash kind of thing around it, its so uncomfortable it bares me to eat or drink. I've been using bonjela for 2weeks now and all it does is numbs it for 5seconds.
