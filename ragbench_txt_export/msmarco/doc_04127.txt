Do not apply exterior lime stucco if there is any risk of freezing, otherwise moisture in the plaster can freeze, expand, and cause critical failure of the plaster. The temperature needs to be above 40 F for at least a week to keep the curing process going. Chicken wire and lath can impede the lime plaster from bonding fully to the straw. When applying lime stucco over strawbale walls, I recommend 3 coats of lime directly on the strawbales. The first coat can be up to 5/8 thick if it is applied to strawbale, otherwise each coat should be a maximum of 3/8 to 1/2 thick.
