dendrogram(tree,P) generates a dendrogram plot with no more than P leaf nodes. If there are more than P data points in the original data set, then dendrogram collapses the lower branches of the tree. As a result, some leaves in the plot correspond to more than one data point. If there are more than 30 data points, then dendrogram collapses lower branches so that there are 30 leaf nodes
