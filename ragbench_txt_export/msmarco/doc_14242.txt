The colormap is particularly appropriate for displaying periodic functions. hsv(m) ---- is the same as hsv2rgb([h ones(m,2)]) where h is the linear ramp, h = (0:m-1)'/m. jet ------- ranges from blue to red, and passes through the colors cyan, yellow, and orange. It is a variation of the hsv colormap. The jet colormap is associated with an astrophysical fluid jet simulation from the National Center for Supercomputer Applications. See the Examples section. lines ----- produces a colormap of colors specified by the axes ColorOrder property and a shade of gray. Try it. Remember to use hold off when finished. Scalar Functions of Two Variables Often we want to visualize a scalar function of two variables, say, z = f(x,y), where each pair of values (x,y) generates a value for z. A plot of z as a function of x and y is a surface in three dimensions.
