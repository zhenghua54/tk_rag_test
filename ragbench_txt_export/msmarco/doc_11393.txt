Augmentin is the brand name of a combination antibiotic drug containing amoxicillin and clauvulanate. It's used to treat bacterial infections in your airways, such as a sinus infection or pneumonia. Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic that kills bacteria by blocking production of a chemical the germs need to build their cell walls. Clavulanate is a chemical that helps antibiotics overcome some bacteria's antibiotic resistance. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Augmentin in 1984.
