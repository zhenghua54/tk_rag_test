Florida rock shrimp, a deep-water cousin of the pink, white and brown shrimp, is often called “the small lobster” and boasts the sweet taste of shrimp with the firm texture of lobster. Rock shrimp derives its name from the rock-like hardness of its shell, which can easily be mistaken for a miniature lobster tail. It is fished year round off Florida's Atlantic coast and in some areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Rock shrimp typically does not grow to a size larger than 21-25 per pound.
