Tent the bird with foil. Roast the turkey for 2 hours. Remove the foil and baste with the remaining butter. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F and continue to roast until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees F in the thigh of the bird, about 45 minutes more. Remove turkey form the oven and set aside to rest for 15 minutes before carving.
