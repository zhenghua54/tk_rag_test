We have defined the limit of a variable, but what we often have is a function of a variable -- which is itself a variable. For example, y = f (x) = x 2. Now, a sequence of values of x, the independent variable, will cause a sequence of values of f (x), the dependent variable. The limit of a function. We say that a function f(x) approaches a limit L as x approaches c if the sequence of values of x, both from the left and from the right, causes the sequence of values of f(x) to satisfy the definition of approaches a limit L: Definition 2.1.
