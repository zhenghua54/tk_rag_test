How much are the monthly payments?The homes are typically under $150,000. The down payment is $2,000. The monthly mortgage payments are calculated at 30% of the applicant and co-applicant's total family income. If selected, you will be required to work one full 8-hour day per week until the house is completed, which normally takes about 12 months. This is what we call “sweat equity.” A single applicant will need to put in a minimum of 250 hours of sweat equity, while two applicants will work a minimum of 300 hours.
