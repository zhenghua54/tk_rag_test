It's much cheaper and easier to buy an exisiting sandwich shop and just get the permits transferred. If you build or remodel one, then you have to get construction permits from the building dept. and health dept. Call them before you do anything if you have questions. There is a sandwich shop close to me and I've heard he makes 15k profit a month. Place only has about 5 tables, mostly take out, affordable prices, about 35 different kind of sandwiches,coffee,sodas,smoothies... Location,Location is everything..
