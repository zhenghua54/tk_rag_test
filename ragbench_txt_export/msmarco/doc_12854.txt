The paper also describes a widening in the pay gap between faculty members at private and public business schools. Full professors, for example, earned an average annual salary of about $107,900 at private schools and $95,300 at public schools in 1997-98. They restricted their analysis to the academic years from 1997-98 to 2004-5, and to full-time faculty members with the rank of assistant, associate, or full professor at research/doctoral or master's universities with at least 10 such faculty members on the business school's payroll.
