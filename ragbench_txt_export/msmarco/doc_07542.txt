Teddy bear early 1900s in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Assumed to be manufactured by Benjamin Michton, son of the founder of Ideal Toy Company in 1903. Owned by Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Kermit Roosevelt. Morris Michtom saw the drawing of Roosevelt and was inspired to create a teddy bear. He created a tiny soft bear cub and put it in the shop window with a sign Teddy's bear, after sending a bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to use his name. The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the Ideal Novelty and Toy Co. Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, teddies have greatly varied in form, style and material. They have become collector's items, with older and rarer teddies appearing at public auctions.
