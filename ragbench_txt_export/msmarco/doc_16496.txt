Most real estate agents make money through commissions â€“ payments made directly to real estate brokers for services rendered in the sale or purchase of real property. A commission is usually a percentage of the property's selling price, although it can be a flat fee. According to the 2013 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers published by the National Association of Realtors, 88% of buyers purchased their home through a real estate agent or broker, a share that has been increasing steadily from 69% in 2001.
