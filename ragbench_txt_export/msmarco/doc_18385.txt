Estimate propane use per square foot for your home. Divide the total BTUs you figured in step 2 by the total square footage of your home figured in step 4. Divide that answer by the total HDD you figured in step 5. The answer is your average BTUs per square foot per HDD. This gives you the most accurate estimate of your propane usage per square foot for the weather conditions and home location. Example: 76,380,000 BTUs divided by 1,500 square feet divided by 2,500 HDD = 20.368 BTUs per square foot per HDD. According to Home Energy: Advancing Home Performance, 39.4 percent of homes using propane heating use between 5 and 10 British Thermal Units (BTU) per square foot. Only 12.2 percent use under 5 BTUs
