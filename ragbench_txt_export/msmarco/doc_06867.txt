6. Plant the onions in the soil differently, depending if you are using seeds, seedlings or sets. 1  If you are growing sweet onions from seeds, plant each seed 3/8 of an inch (1 cm) deep and 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) apart. 2  When you plant rows, make sure they are 15 inches (38 cm) apart. 1 Rows should remain separated by 15 inches (38 cm). 2  If you are planting sweet onions from sets, plant them 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, and rows at 15 inches (38 cm) apart. 3  Plant them shallowly, with the roots into the ground, and the bulb only about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) into the ground.
