Ions and Ionic Compounds Elements combine in a specific ratio to form compounds. Compounds can be categorized as ionic or covalent depending on the type of bond present within the compound. Ionic compounds consist of ionic bonds that arise from the electrostatic (magnetic) attraction between ions (charged species). Part III: Naming Ionic Compounds The name of an ionic compound is simply the combination of the names of the ions. The name is written with the cation listed first followed by the name of the anion. In this section of the lab you will practice developing chemical formulas for and naming ionic
