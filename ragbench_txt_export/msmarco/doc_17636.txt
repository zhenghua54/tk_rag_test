The rule of thumb for pork roasts is to cook them 25 minutes per pound of meat at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Use a thermometer to read the internal temperature of the roast. When the temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 C), pull the roast out of the oven; itâ€™ll continue to cook due to the residual heat and will reach 145 degrees F (63 C).
