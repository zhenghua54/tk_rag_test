ACT Score Range: The Basics. On the ACT, your composite score can be anywhere from a 1 to a 36. Unlike the SAT, the composite score is not the sum of the scores of the other tests-itâ€™s the average. The ACT has four sections: English, Math, Reading, and Science. Each one is also scored on a scale of 1 to 36, and the average of these four scores will make up your composite score.
