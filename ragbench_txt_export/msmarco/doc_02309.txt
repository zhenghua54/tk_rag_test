The Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), commonly referred to as the Confederacy, was a confederation of secessionist American states existing from 1861 to 1865. On March 11, 1861, the Confederate Constitution of seven state signatories— South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas — replaced the February 7 provisional Confederated States constitution with one stating in its preamble a desire for a permanent federal government.
