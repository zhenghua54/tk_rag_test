By Rani Iyer Geoffroy's Spider Monkey Scientific Name: Ateles geoffroyi If you are ready to shake hands with the spider monkey, you will notice some remarkable things about the hand. You will be shaking a long, black-hand, with a vestigial, or poorly developed, thumb and strong hook-like fingers. You can find spider monkeys, in the rainforests from Mexico to Central America. There are five subspecies of Geoffroy’s spider monkey. Nicaragua, Hooded spider monkey, Ornate spider monkey, Mexican, and Yucatan subspecies of spider monkeys. But their needs are the same. The chances are that you find them in a large ‘society’ with 20 or more monkeys.
