For those of you who offer transcription services, I am wondering how you bill: per hour, per project, per page, per line or per word. Also how do you deterime the amount of time it takes to transcribe an audio file or tape. Is it based on number of speakers, length of recording, quality of recording, etc. Re: Per hour, per project, per page, per line or per word. I really think that a per minute rate works best. It makes it very clear right off the bat how much the person can expect to pay for the transcription work.
