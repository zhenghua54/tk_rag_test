Guide. A luteinizing hormone test measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in a sample of blood or urine. LH is produced by the pituitary gland. 1  In women, LH helps regulate the menstrual cycle and egg production (ovulation). 2  In men, LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which plays a role in sperm production. 1 This is called an LH surge. 2  Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels rise and fall together during the monthly menstrual cycle. 3
