Ghost ants are readily adaptable to different living conditions and the locations of their nest. They have been known to build nests in disposable places or places that become inhabitable within a few days. Most likely your kitchen may have a nest of ghost ants nearby. As unpleasant as they are, luckily they do not spread pathogens that make humans sick. In fact these ants are extremely common in Florida homes. Notoriously known as ghost ants, you may encounter some residents referring to them as sugar ants.
