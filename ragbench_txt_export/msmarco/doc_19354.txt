CCRN-K TM certification is for the nursing professional who in their practice applies knowledge in a way that influences patients, nurses and/or organizations to have a positive impact on acutely and/or critically ill patients but does not work at the bedside. There is an exception in the case of advanced practice licensure (for nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, midwife, etc.) â€” a certification exam may be used as a proxy measure for APRN licensure or designation and therefore would not be voluntary, but a requirement for licensure.
