If you are an individual and want to file a lawsuit for $10,000 or less, you have the option of filing a small claims case or a limited civil case. If you are a business, you can file in small claims court for $5,000 or less. 1 For example, in a dispute over whether or not you owe someone money, you can sue in small claims to recover money you paid under protest (which means you have to pay the amount and then go to court to ask for it back). 2  But you cannot sue to get the court to decide whether or not you owe money before you pay it.
