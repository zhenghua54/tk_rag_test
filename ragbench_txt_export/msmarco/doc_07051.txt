1 Just because you roast your ham on the grill instead of in the oven, there is no need to alter any cooking times. 2  A good rule of thumb is 12-15 minutes per pound when you stay between 225-250 degrees for a precooked ham. It is also one of my favorite times because I love ham and split pea soup. I really enjoy a slice of moist, tender ham with a sugary crisp crust. Now, Iâ€™ve made my fair share of ham, and can tell you without a doubt that the best way to achieve this is on a grill. The convection cooking your grill provides is unmatched.
