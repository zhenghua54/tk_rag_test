The glycocalyx of bacteria can assume several forms. If in a condensed form that is relatively tightly associated with the underlying cell wall, the glycocalyx is referred to as a capsule. A more loosely attached glycocalyx that can be removed from the cell more easily is referred to as a slime layer. The second function of a bacterial glycocalyx is to promote the adhesion of the bacteria to living and inert surfaces and the subsequent formation of adherent, glycocalyx-enclosed populations that are called biofilms.
