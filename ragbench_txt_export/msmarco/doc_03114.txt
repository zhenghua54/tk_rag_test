There are several kinds of antiphospholipid antibodies. The three most widely measured are lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β 2 glycoprotein I. These antibodies react with proteins in the blood that are bound to phospholipid, a type of fat molecule that is part of the normal cell membrane. Autoantibodies are antibodies that are directed against one’s self. Antiphospholipid antibodies interfere with the normal function of blood vessels, causing narrowing and irregularity of the vessel (vasculopathy), and by causing blood clots in the vessel (thrombosis).
