Remove the aluminum foil about 30 minutes before the turkey is done to complete the browning of the bird. When done, remove the turkey from the oven and place it on a serving platter or carving board; cover loosely with aluminum foil and let it stand 10 minutes before carving. Do not add water to the pan. Roast the turkey until the meat thermometer reaches 180 degrees F. and the juices run clear. (Click for approximate roasting times .). The roasting time may vary up to 30 minutes, depending upon the bird and the oven. Use the meat thermometer to check the temperature of the dressing. The center of the dressing inside the bird (or in a separate baking dish) must reach a temperature of 165 degrees F. for food safety
