Hydrolysis. In the overall process of hydrolysis, a bond in an organic molecule is broken, and an O-H bond in a water molecule also breaks. Then, from the water molecule, an O-H group adds to one part from the organic molecule, and an H atom to the other. Hydrolysis is therefore the reaction of an organic compound with water. However, hydrolysis is often catalysed (in acidic or alkaline solution), and this is discussed later.
