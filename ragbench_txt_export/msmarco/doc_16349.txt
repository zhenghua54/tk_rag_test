Groups are usually defined by exposure to a potential determinant/cause of the disease, but can be similar things, such as gender. For example, socio-demographic factors, or exposure to factors that may cause the disease. There are several measures of risk, and we will deal with each in turn in this article. 1  Absolute risk = incidence rate. 2  Relative risk.
