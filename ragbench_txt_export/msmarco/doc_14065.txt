The major protest movements began with the civil rights movement during the 1950s and early 1960s. The civil rights movement fought to end long-standing political, social, economic, and legal practices that discriminated against black Americans. All of the protest movements of the 1960s captured public attention and raised questions that were important to the nation. The civil rights movement, the women s movement, and the gay rights movement demanded that Americans consider equality for all citizens in the United States.
