Most homeowner types are four cubic or six cubic feet capacity. Two tons of dry sand is about 1.5 cubic yards-40.5 cubic feet. You will need to make about 11 trips (if you fill the wheelbarrow) with a four footer and about seven trips with a six footer. I think I would allow most of the morning for the chore. I am looking for a picture of 2 tons of sand. Because I have to move 2 tons tomorrow with 1 wheel barrel tomorrow and I was wondering how long its going to take me....I know a picture wont tell me how long I just want to see what its going to look like. Add your answer.
