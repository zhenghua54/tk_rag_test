A faulty vehicle speed sensor can cause a number of problems. The problem often is that these faults or symptoms can be very difficult to diagnose. Sensor faults can appear similar in many ways to other vehicle faults like a defective coil pack or a bad throttle position sensor. If a car is experiencing any of the above symptoms, it is always best if you take your car into a local garage and ask them to run computer diagnostic tests on the vehicle to see if the speed sensor is functioning correctly.
