SQAS (Safety and Quality Assessment System) is a system that is used to evaluate various areas of performance of Logistics Service Providers and Chemical Distributors; ensuring that these companies operate within safety, quality, security and environmental parameters. The SQAS assessments are compiled by independent assessors, who compile the results into a factual report that the Logistic Service Provider or Chemical Distributor can use for evaluation of their own company.
