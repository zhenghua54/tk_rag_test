Names: Scientific Names: the rough green snake is Opheodrys aestivus, and the smooth green snake is Opheodrys vernalis. Common Names: these snakes are sometimes called by a variety of other names, such as grass snakes, green whip snakes, garden snakes, vine snakes, and keeled green snakes. This can lead to much confusion (for example the term grass snake is also used for the European grass snake, Natrix natrix). These are small snakes so do not need a huge tank, but do need vertical space for climbing (even the more terrestrial smooth green snake). A 30 gallon is a good choice because it provides lots of space for greenery and hiding spots.
