Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was one of the diagnoses that received some revisions (PDF). PTSD used to be considered a type of anxiety disorder and in this edition was moved into a new category: “Trauma and Stress-related Disorders”. This could help de-stigmatize PTSD since it is no longer an anxiety related mental illness, but a disorder connected to an external event.
