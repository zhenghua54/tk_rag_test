A height loss of two inches or more may be a cause for concern. Most would not consider their late 30s as being 'over the hill,' but scientists have revealed that we are... at least when it comes to height. This is the age when you start to shrink with men and women losing around half an inch in height each decade. For many this is a gradual process and nothing to worry about. Over the years the discs between the vertebrae flatten, there can be joint space narrowing and muscles start to lose mass.
