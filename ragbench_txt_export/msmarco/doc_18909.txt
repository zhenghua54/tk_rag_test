Cortisone Shot. Cortisone shots are given to decrease inflammation caused by shoulder bursitis. Pain-relieving medication is also sometimes added to the shot. Care must be taken to make sure nerves and blood vessels are not damaged during the injection. Immediate Care. Cortisone shots can cause a flare reaction in the first 24 to 48 hours. This can be caused by the body responding to the needle injury or from small crystals that form in the injected tissue.
