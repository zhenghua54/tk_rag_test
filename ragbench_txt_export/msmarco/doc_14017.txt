The role of VVI pacemaker is that in the event that a heart is slowing down, or stop, sends an electrical impulse to the right ventricle and activates the heart. Electrical impulses from the right ventricle passes to the left ventricle and thereby runs the blood flow. VVI pacemaker is not sufficient when the ventricles are not able to beat together in the cases of congestive cardiac failure and then dual chamber pacemaker is required. Possible problems during implementation of VVI pacemakers are: 1  collapsed lung. 2  infection. 3  pericarditis. 4  air embolism.
