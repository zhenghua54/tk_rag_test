This sequence allows the recruitment of proteins that bind simultaneously to both the 5’ and 3′ UTR, not allowing translation proteins to assemble. However, it has also been noted that Sxl can also repress translation of RNAs that do not contain a poly(A) tail, or more generally, 3′ UTR. The elements of a eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5′ UTR differ greatly. The prokaryotic 5′ UTR contains a ribosome binding site (RBS), also known as the Shine Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGGU) which is usually 3-10 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon.
