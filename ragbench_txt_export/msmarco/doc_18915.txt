For some reason i thought 2 tons of sand, 4000 pounds, would be this Ginormous amount, maybe 12 feet high ! I kept waiting for the guy to dump the rest of it. At one point he climbed up into the dump truck with a shovel and I thought he just has to knock the rest of it loose. So here's a visual for those of you like me who can't imagine 2 tons of anything! By the way, I have an 8x14 run and it has about 4 inches of asphalt sand now. I thought I would get 6 inches and have some left over. Looks kind of like the sand at a lake beach in Ohio
