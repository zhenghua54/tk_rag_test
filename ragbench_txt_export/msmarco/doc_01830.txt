How it works. If your landlord applies to the court for accelerated possession, the court will send you a copy of the application. If you want to challenge the application, you must do this within 14 days of receiving it. If the judge makes a possession order, you’ll normally have 14 or 28 days to leave the property. If this will cause you exceptional hardship, the judge may give you up to 42 days to leave. If you don’t leave at this point, your landlord can use bailiffs to evict you.
