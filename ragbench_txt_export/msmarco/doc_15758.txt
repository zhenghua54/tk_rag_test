Ethnic Cleansing. The term Ethnic Cleansing was created in the 1990's to describe the new interactions between some ethnic groups. The purpose of Ethnic Cleansing is to rid an area of an entire ethnic group so the remaining ethnicity can be the only inhabitants of the area. Ethnic cleansing is not to defeat an enemy or subjugate them as is the case in traditional wars.
