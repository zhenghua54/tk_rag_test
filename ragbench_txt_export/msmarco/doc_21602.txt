I tried to get a boat looked at in the middle of Georgia and the quotes I got were 2x that for a basic survey. RE: Marine Surveyor Cost. Recently done in SW Florida: It cost me the loss of a purchase of a used boat because it seems the seller is balking on fixing a hull void on a SW Fla W/A. Cost was $15.00 ft, had a low quote of $12.00 Engine diag and ck was another $200.00.
