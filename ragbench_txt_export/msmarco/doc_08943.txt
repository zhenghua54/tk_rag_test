If you are anything like me, you much prefer your kombucha to have some carbonation. I’ve struggled some with that over time but now, after probably 50 gallons of kombucha making experience, including various relatively scientific experiments, I’ve figured out a simple and dependable way to make a nice fizzy kombucha. The result will be a carbonated kombucha treat. Lactobacillis bacteria live naturally on Ginger as on many other vegetables and roots. It is this bacteria which feeds off the sugars in the bottled kombucha and adds carbonation as a by-product.
