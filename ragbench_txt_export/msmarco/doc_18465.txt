3 years ago. People with transplants can live a full, long life. I got my first kidney transplant at the age of 13. Thirty one years later, it wore out just as my second transplant arrived. I've had it for almost four years. I have a full life and compete at the National level in a popular sport. 4 years ago. Hi, I had a kidney and liver transplant when I was 15 and I'm 28 now.I'm still on my first kidney and liver, and i'm doing great. You can have as many kidney transplants as you need. You can also go in dialsis if needed and people have lived for years on it.
