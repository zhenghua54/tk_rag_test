Earning a bachelor's degree is the first step toward becoming a neurologist. There is no specific major required for undergraduate study; however, aspiring neurologists may benefit from concentrating their studies in biological sciences, chemistry, physics or pre-med to meet admission requirements for medical school. Neurologists are physicians and surgeons who treat patients with nervous system disorders, including problems with the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
