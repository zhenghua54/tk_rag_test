Terrazzo flooring is a composite material poured in place or pre-cast which is used for wall and floor finishes. Terrazzo can consist of marble, quartz, granite, glass and other types of aggregate chips mixed with a binder that is portland cement based, resin based or a hybrid of both types and colored pigments. Poured in place terrazzo is cured and then ground and polished to the desired surface finish. If the terrazzo is cement based it will still be necessary to remove any wax, sealers or other protective coating from the entire surface of the terrazzo before proceeding with the tile or stone installation. Tile or stone can be installed onto existing cement based terrazzo using 254 Platinum. If a waterproofing/anti-fracture membrane is required over cement based terrazzo then follow the steps to completely remove any wax, sealer or protective coating and then skim coat the surface of the terrazzo with 254 Platinum
