The actual cost to install a gas line depends on the amount of piping needed, the local economy, the complexity of the installation, and other factors. 1  As a very general estimate, installing gas line costs $20 to $30 per foot. 2  In some areas and circumstances, however, the price could be $75 per foot or more. 1 Extending a gas line to accommodate a new appliance might cost $250 to $500. 2  If, however, that same appliance requires a new line running back to the manifold, costs could reach $500 to $1,000 or more.
