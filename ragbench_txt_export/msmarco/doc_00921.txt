DNA fingerprinting is a way of identifying a specific individual, rather than simply identifying a species or some particular trait. It is also known as genetic fingerprinting or DNA profiling. As a technology, it has been around since at least 1985, when it was announced by its inventor, Sir Alec Jeffreys. DNA fingerprinting is currently used both for identifying paternity or maternity and for identifying criminals or victims. There is discussion of using DNA fingerprinting as a sort of personal identifier as well, although the viability of this is debatable. The majority of a human's DNA will match that of any other human. The sections of DNA used in DNA fingerprinting are passed doen from parents to their children. DNA fingerprinting is becoming increasingly prevalent in the world of criminal forensics.
