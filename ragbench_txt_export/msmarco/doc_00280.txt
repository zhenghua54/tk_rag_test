From LSD to PCP to Ketamine, hallucinogens are widely used and abused drugs that produce profound disturbances in the user's perception of reality. There are naturally occurring hallucinogens as well, including peyote and psilocybin, better known as magic mushrooms. Users of LSD typically feel some something within 30 to 90 minutes of ingestion, and the effects may last as long as 12 hours. Users refer to LSD hallucinogenic experiences as trips and to the negative ones as bad trips.. Most LSD trips include both pleasant and unpleasant aspects.
