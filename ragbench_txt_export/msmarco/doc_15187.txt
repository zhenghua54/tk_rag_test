Example:If your practice normally closes at 4 p.m. on Fridays, but your physician sees a patient at 7 p.m. and conducts a level-three established patient visit, you should bill 99213 (for the E/M) and 99050 (for the after-hours visit). ... ... 99051:Concept and Scenario:-. It is my understanding that when you are open on the weekends with posted hours, you cannot bill for 99051 or 99050. If I understand your question, you are now open until 7 p.m. during the week and 10 a.m. until 12 p.m. on Saturdays.
