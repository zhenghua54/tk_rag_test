The spiral bacteria are spirilla (singular form is spirillus) and the rod-shaped bacteria are bacilli (singular form is bacillus). The coccus (plural form is cocci) bacteria are spherical and are usually found in clusters or chains. Bacilli have a large surface area that helps them take in nutrients, but they may dry out easily. Cocci do not dry out as quickly and retain water, but they absorb nutrients slowly.
