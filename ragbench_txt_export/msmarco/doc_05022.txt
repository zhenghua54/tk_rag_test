The average cost per square foot for commercial building is in the  median range of $200. There are several factors that figure into  the price such as size and location. Living space can range from $100 to $125 a square foot and up depending on finishes and what kind of mechanical systems (plumbing, HVAC, electric) are involved. I've built some REALLY nicely upgraded/finished homes for $125 to $150 per square foot. $40 and up for garages is ok.
