Save. Copyright is a protection that the federal government gives to authors for their original works. Original works of authorship include literature, music, visual art and other art forms, published or unpublished. GNU is a type of license that applies to copyrighted works that have a notice from the copyright holder that says the work can be distributed under the terms of a GNU license. This notice grants a worldwide and unlimited duration to use that work under certain conditions, such as making copies of the work.
