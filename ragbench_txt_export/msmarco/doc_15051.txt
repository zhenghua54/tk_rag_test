These symptoms occur partly because pleural thickening, fibrosis, and effusion cause lung tissue to become rigid, meaning the lungs are unable to inflate properly. Thickening of the pleura is a symptom of both asbestosis and mesothelioma, but has other causes not related to asbestos. Tuberculosis, caused by lung infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, can also cause pleural thickening. Some diseases can cause these membranes to thicken, often as a result of inflammation. Pleural thickening is commonly linked to mesothelioma and asbestosis, which are caused by asbestos exposure. The condition can also be caused by other diseases such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.
