Physiologic Jaundice. Physiologic Jaundice is the most common and normal type of jaundice in babies. It can affect up to 60% of full term babie s in the first week of life, and it is caused by elevated bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is a substance created by the normal breakdown of red blood cells. It is processed and removed by the liver. Jaundice will develop when a babyâ€™s liver is not efficient enough to remove the bilirubin from the bloodstream.
