Tropical Rainforest valleys are shaped in a 'U' or a 'V'. They are usually a low land area between hills or mountains that allows a river or stream to pass by its base. Valleys and dales are somewhat alike, yet different. Mountains are a landform that is formed by the Earth's tectonic plates crashing into one another. The highest Tropical Rainforest mountain is the Pica da Neblina located in the Amazon Rainforest.
