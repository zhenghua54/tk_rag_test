WASHINGTON, D.C.—A tobacco cessation program in Massachusetts saved the state Medicaid program $3 for every $1 it invested within the first 17 months. “It is very rare to have a program where cost savings can be quantified within 17 months,” Leighton Ku said about the program. Matt McKillop a senior research associate from The Pew Charitable Trusts said improper Medicaid payments cost the states $11 billion in 2010. He said the eye-popping amount led Pew to establish its Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse database, www.pewstates.org/Medicaid-fraud.
