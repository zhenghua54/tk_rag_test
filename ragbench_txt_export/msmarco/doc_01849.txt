The temperate deciduous forest biome is located in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and Japan. The trees of the temperate deciduous forest are deciduous of course. Their leaves change color with the season and eventually fall to the ground during winter. The four seasons are easily recognizable and each lasts about 3 months.
