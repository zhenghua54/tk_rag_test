A quantitative result expressed in IU/mL and log IU/mL indicates the degree of active HBV viral replication in the patient. Monitoring HBV DNA levels over time is important for assessing disease progression or monitoring a patient's response to anti-HBV therapy. This test is not licensed by the FDA as a screening test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections or a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of HBV infection. Laboratory evaluation of HBV infection status should begin with HBV serologic testing, including testing for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen.
