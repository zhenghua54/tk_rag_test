When you mow the lawn after fertilizing, the clipped grass blades act as mulch barriers for the newly applied nutrients. Allowing the clippings to stay on the lawn provides the grass with other forms of organic nutrients to complement the fertilizer. In this case, you can mow directly after watering. A thorough watering across the entire lawn ensures the fertilizer is deeply embedded in the soil, rather than attaching itself to the grass blades.
