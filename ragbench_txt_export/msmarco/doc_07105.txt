Ferrous Sulfate is classified as an iron preparation indicated for the prevention and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia, a condition wherein there are too few red blood cells inside oneâ€™s body. This condition may be due to poor diet, pregnancy, excess bleeding, or other medical problems. Ferrous Sulfate is available in different forms: coated long-acting tablets, regular extended-release capsules, and oral liquid (drops, syrup and elixir). This medication should be taken exactly as directed to prevent over dosage and untoward reactions to the body.
