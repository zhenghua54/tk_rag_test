Most doctors – and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) — agree that a normal body temperature for a healthy baby is between 97 and 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit. If your baby's rectal temperature is 100.4 degrees or higher, he has a fever. A higher-than-normal body temperature is called a fever. A fever is usually a sign that the body is waging a war against infection. Taking your baby's temperature can confirm your suspicions and help you and your child's doctor figure out the best way to get your baby back on the road to health.
