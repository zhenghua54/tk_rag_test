Terrazzo is a highly versatile solid surface material invented by Venetian mosaic workers in the 15th century. Traditionally, terrazzo is comprised of marble chips embedded into a cement base, then ground flat and coated with a topical sealer. Although marble is still the aggregate of choice for most applications, terrazzo can also be made from recycled glass and metallics, as well as natural aggregates such as mother of pearl. Terrazzo can also be set into precision cut forms to create logos, medallions, text, or any abstract pattern imaginable.
