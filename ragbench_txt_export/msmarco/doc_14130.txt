The cervical lymph nodes are glands in the human lymphatic system, which is a complicated series of vessels and passageways that bring specialized fluid to the heart and most major organs. The cervical system is located in the neck and is present in people of both genders, adults and children alike. The cervical lymph nodes are some of the best known nodes of the lymphatic system in part because of their role in disease detection. When the body is fighting some sort of major infection, all or at least many of the lymph nodes may swell.
