The Tropical Rainforest made up 14% of the Earth's surface, now there are only about 6% left that covers the land. This 6% of land features mountains, valleys, flood plains, streams, rivers, and a little bit of wetlands. It also contains high and lowlands, beaches, as well as some karsts. Mountains are a landform that is formed by the Earth's tectonic plates crashing into one another. The highest Tropical Rainforest mountain is the Pica da Neblina located in the Amazon Rainforest.
