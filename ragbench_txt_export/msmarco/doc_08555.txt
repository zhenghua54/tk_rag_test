A pulled calf muscle is the most common cause of calf pain, but there are other, potentially life threatening causes of calf pain. Visit the calf pain section to find out more. Other common terms for the condition include a calf muscle strain or torn calf muscle. Essentially, what all these terms refer to is when the calf muscles are pulled beyond their normal elastic limit, overstretching them and damaging some or all of muscle fibres.
