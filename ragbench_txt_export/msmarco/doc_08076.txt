He arranges for Juliet to marry Paris immediately. Lady Capulet delivers the news, but Juliet is not thrilled as her father expected her to be. In fact, she flatly refuses to marry Paris--or anyone else, for that matter. Capulet's reaction is extraordinary. He yells at her, he curses her, he calls her names, and he vows to disown her. Capulet sounds like a loving and reasonable father when he tells Paris that Juliet is too young and that. My will to her consent is but a part. Capulet makes it clear that he will never consent to anyone marrying his daughter without her approval.
