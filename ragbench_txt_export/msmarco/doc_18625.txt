GIS is an analysis tool that's used in a wide range of areas, including health, city government, transportation, urban planning, business marketing, geology and archaeology. Employment of GIS specialists and cartographers is projected to grow 20 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is faster than average across all occupations. However, since it's a small field to start with, this growth will only create about 2,400 new jobs during that period.
