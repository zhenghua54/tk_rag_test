To provide clarity for the profession, the authors offer a definition of applied sport psychology conceptualized as a sub-field of performance psychology. The constructs of performance and performance issues are also defined. In this sense, sport psychology is really a domain within performance psychology; it is the study of performance psychology principles and interventions in the context of competitive athletics (rather than other types of performance).
