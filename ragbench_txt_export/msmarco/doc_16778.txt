The parietal pericardium is an outer layering wall of the Pericardial Cavity between the pericardial membranes. The outer-most layer is the fibrous layer (fibrosa), and contains nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics. The visceral pericardium is the inner-most layer of the pericardium, and is also known as the Epicardium as it lays upon the heart. The Pericardial Cavity lies between the visceral pericardium and the parietal pericardium
