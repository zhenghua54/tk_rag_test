The antenna on the scarab's head and its practice of rolling dung across the desert sands caused the ancient Egyptians to link the scarab to solar symbolism. The scarab god Khepera pushes the setting sun along the sky, the same way a scarab beetle rolls his ball of dung. Perhaps the most common use of Scarabs worn as jewelry and amulets is in ancient Egypt. The Scarab was extremely prevalent in their art, their jewellery, and their myths. The scarab was worshipped as 'Khepera', which means 'he was come forth'.
