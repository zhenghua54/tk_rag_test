From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A persuasive definition is a form of definition which purports to describe the 'true' or 'commonly accepted' meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an uncommon or altered use, usually to support an argument for some view, or to create or alter rights, duties or crimes. Examples of persuasive definitions include: 1  atheist – someone who doesn't yet realize that God exists. 2  Democrat – a leftist who desires to overtax the corporations and abolish freedom in the economic sphere. 3  Republican – an old white man who feels threatened by change..
