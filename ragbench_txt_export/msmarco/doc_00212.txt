Sitagliptin is used alone or together with other medicines (e.g., insulin, glimepiride, metformin, or pioglitazone) to treat high blood sugar levels caused by type 2 diabetes. Normally, after you eat, your pancreas releases insulin to help your body store excess sugar for later use. Sitagliptin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes, because they cannot produce insulin from their pancreas. Their blood sugar is best controlled with insulin injections.
