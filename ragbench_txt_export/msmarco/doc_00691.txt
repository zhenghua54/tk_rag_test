Ketosis is not an on/off switch that your muscles will respond to, its just an indicator of the ketone levels in the blood. You don't need carbs to build muscle, and you can derive plenty of energy (to train) from dietary fat. If you want to go low carb, just go full keto and eat 65% fat, 30% protein, 5% carbs.
