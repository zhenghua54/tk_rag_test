Often it is possible to identify snakes by their shed skins alone (you can do so too, here). I have had some pretty serious exercise of this skill this week. In the past three days, I have found three fairly fresh snake sheds on islands in the Matanzas River. Most often, though, a shed is either torn apart by the snake as it sheds, or tears itself apart as a result of drying out (it is wet when the snake sheds it off, as a result of lymphatic fluid excreted by the snakeâ€™s integument to aid in the shedding process).
