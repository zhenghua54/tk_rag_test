Viral illnesses are the most common cause of upper respiratory symptoms. Symptoms of a viral illness often appear over several hours without prior illness. Common viral illnesses include colds and the flu (influenza). Bacterial respiratory tract infections are less common than viral infections. Pneumonia is the most common bacterial infection of the lower respiratory system. Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections only after they have developed, so most doctors do not prescribe them until a bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed.
