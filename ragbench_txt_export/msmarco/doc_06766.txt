Nausea. Nausea can be another early indicator of pregnancy. The majority of pregnant women do not complain of morning sickness until the 6th week of pregnancy, 2 weeks after a missed period. But for some women, that nagging feeling can start as early as one week after conception, a full week before a missed period. Women who develop these symptoms before a missed period are, likely, very in tune with their body and are sensitive to even the tiniest hormonal changes. These very early pregnancy symptoms may occur up to a week before there are enough pregnancy hormones circulating in the body to give a positive pregnancy test result.
