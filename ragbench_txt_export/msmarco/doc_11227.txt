The use of the TM and SM designations informs the public that a word, logo, slogan, design, etc., is being used as a mark and reflects the owner’s intent to claim trademark rights in the mark. However, using one of these symbols does not guarantee that the owner’s mark will be protected under trademark laws. One common example of trademark marking is the use of the ® symbol, which conveys to the public that the mark is registered in the national trademark office of the particular jurisdiction where the goods or services designated by the mark are being sold or provided.
