OBJECTIVE: Transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) cervical length (CL) screening has been proposed as an alternative to universal transvaginal screening to identify women at an increased risk of preterm birth. We sought to identify whether and under what circumstances TAUS would be cost-effective. In comparison to TAUS, universal transvaginal CL screening reduced preterm birth by 0.03%, reduced costs by $1.2 million and increased quality-adjusted life years by 70 per 100,000 women.
