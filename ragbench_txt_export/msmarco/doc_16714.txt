The minimum age before you can join the fire service is 18 years old. Applicants can apply at 17 yrs 10 months. If you are under this age you still may be able to get help by joining a Young Firefighters Scheme. You will need to contact the brigade closest to you, to see if this is something they offer. No formal qualifications are required to become a firefighter. However, you will need to pass a series of written and apptitude tests to proceed with any application. Any qualifications you bring into the service may help with future promotion.
