In some cases, the DNA analyst job position may require a presentation of findings in a courtroom setting. In order to become an actual DNA analyst and work in a crime lab, one must have a bachelor’s of arts or a bachelor’s of science degree in chemistry, biology, or forensic science. DNA analyst salaries can vary quite a bit based on a number of different factors. The 2012 BLS report shows that the median 2012 salary for forensic science techs, including the DNA analyst salary, was $52,480.
