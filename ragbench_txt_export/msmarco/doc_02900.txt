The most common spelling in Scandinavia is Erik. In Norway, another form of the name (which has kept the Old Norse diphthong) Eirik is also commonly used. In Finland, the form Erkki is also used. The modern Icelandic version is Eirikur, eir√≠kur while the Modern faroese version Is. eirikur This was partly because of the publishing of the novel Eric, or, Little by Little by Frederick William Farrar in 1858. In Norway, Sweden and Finland, the name day for Erik and Eirik is 18 May, commemorating the death of Saint Eric of Sweden.
