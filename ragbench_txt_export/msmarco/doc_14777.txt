Chest X-ray Test Overview. A chest X-ray test is a very common non-invasive radiology test that produces an image of the chest and the internal organs. To produce a chest X-ray test, the chest is briefly exposed to radiation from an X-ray machine and an image is produced on a film or into a digital computer.
