Bring the water back to a boil and cook until the crabs start to float. Depending on the size of the crabs, this will happen in 10 to 15 minutes or so. Use tongs to remove the crabs and set them out until cool enough to handle. Bring an inch of salt water to a boil in a large pot. Put the crabs in a steamer basket or insert, or simply pile them into the pot and let the bottom crab or two boil slightly and act as a platform for the other crabs to steam. Cook 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of the crabs. Remove the steamer or pull the crabs out of the pot with tongs. However you cook the crabs, let them sit until cool enough to handle before you clean and serve them
