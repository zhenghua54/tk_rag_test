Ceiling lights and draping is one of our clients most favorite things to have. But again, like said in the above statment not every venue can handle this. They either need to have had installed hooks or a pulley system or open beams. We use sheer fabric 10ft wide for our fabric draping but we also use tulle. Tulle can still look nice and doesn’t have the weight of sheer fabric. Ceiling lights and draping are a lot of work, but worth it if you can have it at your venue. I have brides ask me to drape fabric on low, (11′ or lower) ceilings, and it just doesn’t look as good as the pictures of these very high spaces. Venues with ceiling grids are the easiest. You can use ceiling clips or specialty magnets with hooks that are relatively expensive, but are perfect to do this kind of hanging.
