No doubt because I see no place for myself in this world.. Napoleon Bonaparte was born the 15th of August, 1769 on Corsica, just three months after the island had been defeated by the French. He would spend his childhood hating France, the nation he would one day rule. I was born when [Corsica] was perishing.
