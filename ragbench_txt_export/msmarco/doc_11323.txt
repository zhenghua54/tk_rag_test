Most people are very sensitive to the dose of Adderall IR and Adderall XR. A patient can discern a 2 or 3 mg. difference in the dose. The immediate-release version comes in increments of 2.5 mg. in a range from 5 mg. to 30 mg. tablets. The extended-release formulation comes in 5 mg. Since the FDA has not studied the use of Adderall IR in children younger than three years of age, or of Adderall XR in children younger than six years of age, the FDA does not approve the use of Adderall XR in these younger age groups.
