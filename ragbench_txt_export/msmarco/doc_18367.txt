where p is the frequency of the A allele and q is the frequency of the a allele in the population. In the equation, p 2 represents the frequency of the homozygous genotype AA, q 2 represents the frequency of the homozygous genotype aa, and 2pq represents the frequency of the heterozygous genotype Aa. In addition, the sum of the allele frequencies for all the alleles at the locus must be 1, so p + q = 1.
