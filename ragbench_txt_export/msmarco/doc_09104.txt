Continental vs Pirelli. Howdy I need to replace 2 of the tyres on my '99 model A6 2.4 front wheel drive. I currently have 4 Michelins of which 2 have to be replaced. I have gotten qoutes for Pirelli at R885 per tyre fully fitted and Continental for 878 fully fitted, size 205 55 16. What would you guys recommend? I plan to on Saturday replace 2 of the Michelins, move the 2 that have some tread left to the rear and put 2 new tyres in front
