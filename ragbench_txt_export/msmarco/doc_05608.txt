In the services industry, strategic sourcing refers to a service solution, sometimes called a Strategic Partnership, that is specifically customized to meet the client's individual needs. In a production environment, it is often considered one component of supply chain management. As strategic sourcing is put in place and practiced over time, many large, sophisticated organizations will modify the process to better meet their individual corporate needs. Outsourcing a business practice to another company may also be incorporated into a sourcing strategy for services.
