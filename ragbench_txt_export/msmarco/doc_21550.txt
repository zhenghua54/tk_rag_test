Arms. When you shoot a basketball, you are primarily relying on the muscles of your arms to direct your shot and propel the ball forward. The triceps extend your elbow and play a major role in shooting. Shoulders. The trapezius, which is located at the collarbone, and the deltoid, which surrounds the joint of the shoulder near the arm, are the primary shoulder muscles involved in shooting a basketball. These muscles help to raise your arm and rotate your shoulders as you aim and then shoot.
