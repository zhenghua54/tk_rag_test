1. Check if your rabbit is pregnant. Medium to large size rabbits are sexually mature at 4 to 4.5 months, while giant breeds are ready at 6 to 9 months. If your female rabbit is at this stage of maturity and you have reason to suspect that she has been breeding, then check for pregnancy as follows. 1 Until the age of 8 months, keep kits fed on rabbit pellets. 2  Leave the kits with mother until 6-7 weeks of age. 3  At this point, if the litter is large, you can remove the largest pair or trio and place them in their own cage. 4  This will give a chance to the smaller ones to nurse for a week longer and catch up in weight.
