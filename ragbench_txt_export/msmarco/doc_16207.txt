Ceiling Angle. The ceiling's angle is another necessary factor regarding fan size. The angle is measured in degrees and reflects the difference between the ceiling and adjoining walls. Using a roof angle finder and a leveler can help you calculate the ceiling's angle. A ceiling fan with a 12-inch downrod is suitable for a vaulted ceiling that has a 14- to 18.4-degree ceiling angle.
