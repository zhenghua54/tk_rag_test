I don't know the exact name of this right now, I am using candid ointment and dermaic powder. In the Telugu language this problem is called sobhi. There is no itching or pain but the only the skin looks ugly and is spreading all over the body. My skin looks like snake skin with spots all over. A. In my assessment, you are referring to the condition called as tinea versicolor (Pityriasis versicolor), caused by Malassezia furfur. It produces asymptomatic hypo-or hyperpigmented spots over the upper trunk.
