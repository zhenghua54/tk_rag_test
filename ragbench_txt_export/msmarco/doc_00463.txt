Hurtling through space at an average speed of 18.4 miles per second (30km per second), Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun. Not only is the Earth orbiting around the sun, but it also rotating on its axis at 1,070 miles per hour (1,722 km per hour), the speed at the equator. Source: NOAA. When the North Pole tilts most toward the sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer. This occurs when the Earth is farthest away from the sun, and begins around June 21-22. Astronomers refer to the arrival of this event as the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.
