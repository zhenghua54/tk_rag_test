When a company uses the accrual basis of accounting, revenue is recognized on the company's income statement when it is earned. When the customer pays for the job or service before the work has been performed and completed, the payment is recorded on the company's balance sheet as deferred, or unearned, revenue. At the end of September, the balance in the deferred revenue account will be $5,500, the total advance payment for the contract minus the services provided in the first month that are now recognized in revenue.
