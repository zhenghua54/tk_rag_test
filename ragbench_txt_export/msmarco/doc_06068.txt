Originally ginseng referred to a family of plants called Panax ginseng. Panax plants are also known as American Ginseng and Red Ginseng. The other types got their name and were discovered to have remarkable health benefits. Given the popularity of the ginseng name, it was the easiest way to label them. This is true for all types of ginseng. The roots of the ginseng plant are where the nutrients lie. For this reason I like to take a ginseng supplement only if it specifically states “Brazilian Ginseng root”, or something similar. The phytonutrients found in ginseng are not available in the leaf.
