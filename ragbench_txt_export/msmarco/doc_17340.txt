Complex Arabesque inlays at the Agra Fort in the Mughal Empire. The arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils or plain lines, often combined with other elements. The use of arabesque as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in William Beckford 's novel Vathek in 1786. Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media.
