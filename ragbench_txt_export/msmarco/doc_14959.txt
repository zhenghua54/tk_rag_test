In a 2-quart heavy saucepan, heat oil or butter over low heat, stirring occasionally until melted. Add rice and lime juice, stir for 1 minute. Add water and salt and bring to a full rolling boil. At boiling, cover and turn down to simmer over low heat until rice is tender and the water is absorbed â€“ about 25 minutes. Add in the cilantro and fluff rice with a fork.
