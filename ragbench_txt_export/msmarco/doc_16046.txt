A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in a blood sample. Bilirubin is a brownish yellow substance found in bile. It is produced when the liver breaks down old red blood cells. Bilirubin is then removed from the body through the stool (feces) and gives stool its normal color. The bilirubin test is used to: 1  Check liver function and watch for signs of liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or the effects of medicines that can damage the liver. 2  Find out if something is blocking the bile ducts. 3  This may occur if gallstones, tumors of the pancreas, or other conditions are present.
