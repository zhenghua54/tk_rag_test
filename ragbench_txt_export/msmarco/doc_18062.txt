Tell us what it is, calculate how fast you read, and we will tell you. For example, find out how long you have to read before the A Walk in the Woods movie comes out if you like reading the book before seeing the movie. A Walk in the Woods is a hilarious memoir besides, please put it next on your list. If you have a book project and want to plan your schedule so you have enough time to read it, great! Find out how long it will take you to read based on how far you are and your reading speed. We will give you an estimate so you can plan how many minutes you will need to read every day. You can also see how long it will take you to read your 'to-read' shelf on Goodreads, or view one of our pre-compiled lists such as 100 young adult novels everyone should read, or, the top 35 most influential classic books. Please keep in mind that this tool should be used merely to give you an estimate
