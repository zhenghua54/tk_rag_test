Mule deer, along with many other ungulates, are polygynous. The bucks fight for dominance and for the right to mate with the females. Antlers are shed after the breeding season, anytime from late January to early April. Once mated, the gestation period of the mule deer lasts for a little over 200 days. The doe delivers one to four fawns (usually 2) from late May to early June. A doe will usually produce a single fawn the first year she gives birth and then produce twins in following years.
