These old population II giant stars are mostly found in globular clusters. They are characterised by their short periods, usually about 1.5 hours to a day and have a brightness range of 0.3 to 2 magnitudes. Spectral classes range from A7 to F5. This in turn allows us to determine the distance to such stars and is discussed in more detail on the next page. As with non-pulsating variables, there are several types of pulsating stars and some of the key types are described briefly below.
