The term psychedelic is derived from the Greek words ψυχή (psyche, soul, mind) and δηλείν (delein, to manifest), hence soul-manifesting, the implication being that psychedelics can access the soul and develop unused potentials of the human mind. A psychedelic substance is a psychoactive drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors.
