A common polysaccharide found in plants would be starch. Starch is made up of roughly 20% amylose and 80% amylopectin which both have a very similar structure except amylope â€¦ ctin is made up of much larger molecules. It is the energy storage system like batteries. Another very common polysaccharide is cellulose. This is the main structural material. All of these molecules are made up of glucose molecules bonded together. In starch the bonds are alpha while in cellulose beta. This sort of means right handed for starch and left handed for cellulose.
