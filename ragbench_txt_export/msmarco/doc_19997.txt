The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays, and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory. In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction.
