Most bacteria are 0.2 um in diameter and 2-8 um in length. The three basic bacterial shapes are coccus (spherical), bacillus (rod-shaped), and spiral (twisted), however pleomorphic bacteria can assume several shapes. Arrangement of cocci. Cocci may be oval, elongated, or flattened on one side. Cocci may remain attached after cell division. These group characteristics are often used to help identify certain cocci. Cocci that remain in pairs after dividing are called diplococci.
