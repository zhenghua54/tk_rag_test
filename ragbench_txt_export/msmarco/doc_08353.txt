Although the normal age of menopause can vary anywhere between 45 years to 55 years, the average age of menopause is 51 years. Surgical menopause, of course, can occur at any time the uterus is surgically removed. Taking birth control pills which prevent ovulation will also delay menopause. Birth control pills contain hormones that can block the process of oocyte maturation and ovulation. This will again prevent decrease in the number of oocytes in the ovaries.
