First of all a crested gecko would approximately cost around $70-200, depending on where you buy it. At Petsmart, it would cost $70. Petland $120. Petcetera $180. Breeders, (my favs) around $100, which is a reasonable price if you ask me. For the setup, taller is better than wider. Tank (20 gallon)=60$. 40-50 gallon tank= around 120$. Repashys crested gecko diet = $10. Vine, cave or any other decor would usually be from 5 to $30. They do not need lighting as they are nocturnal of that together would be around $
