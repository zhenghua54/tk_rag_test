RNA nucleotides differ from DNA nucleotides by the presence of a hydroxyl group linked to the #2 carbon of the sugar. The presence of this hydroxyl group allows RNA polymers to assume a more diverse number of shapes compared to DNA polymers. RNA nucleotides form polymers of alternating ribose and phosphate units linked by a phosphodiester bridge between the #3 and #5 carbons of neighboring ribose molecules.
