Presynaptic neurons are the neurons that conduct the AP to release a neurotransmitter and they affect the postsynaptic neurons. What ALWAYS causes a neuron to release any neurotransmitter (whether it is excitatory or inhibitory) is an action potential. Contrast that with exitatory NTs: All excitatory neurotransmitters cause an opening of ligand-gated sodium ion channels. The inhibitory NT could also cause an opening up of ligand-gated Chloride I
