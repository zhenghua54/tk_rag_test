1 In the Ruby-throated Hummingbird, incubation--which is done only by the female--usually lasts 16-18 days, sometimes longer during cool weather. 2  She typically lays one egg, skips a day, and then lays a second; incubation does not start until both eggs are laid. The best way to find a hummer nest is to wait for the female to lead you to it. This may not work, however, since the nest can be up to 1.5km or more from a good feeding area. Among Ruby-throated Hummingbirds, nests may be in hardwoods or evergreens from about one to 20 meters (three to 60 feet) from the ground.
