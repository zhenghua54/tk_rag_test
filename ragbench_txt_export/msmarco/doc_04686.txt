Pulsating variable stars are intrinsic variables as their variation in brightness is due to a physical change within the star. In the case of pulsating variables this is due to the periodic expansion and contraction of the surface layers of the stars. This in turn allows us to determine the distance to such stars and is discussed in more detail on the next page. As with non-pulsating variables, there are several types of pulsating stars and some of the key types are described briefly below.
