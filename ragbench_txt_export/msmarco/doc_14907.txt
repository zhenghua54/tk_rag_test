Anthrax disease is a severe illness caused by bacteria named Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax disease can result in pneumonia, blood infection, and death. Most of the time anthrax bacteria live in an inactive form called spores. 1 Lung Anthrax or Pneumonia is the most likely form of disease after an intentional release of anthrax and occurs by breathing in anthrax spores. 2  After exposure, it usually takes 2-7 days (but sometimes up to 2 months) until illness starts.
