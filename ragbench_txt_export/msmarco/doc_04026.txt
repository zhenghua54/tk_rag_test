Twitter offers three types of advertising options – promoted tweets, promoted accounts and promoted trends. The first two cost between $.50 – $4.00 per engagement, and promoted trends will cost you $200,000 per day. Twitter Promoted Tweets. Promoted tweets are exactly that – tweets you have already tweeted that you wish to promote. They appear in timelines and search results. The price per follower depends on your targeting, but you can expect $2.50 – $4.00 per new follower. For local campaigns we have seen it on the lower end of $2.50 per follower. Twitter Promoted Trends. If you’re looking for massive exposure in a short amount of time, promoted trends are your best friend.
