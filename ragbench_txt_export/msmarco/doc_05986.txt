Do not buy into the myth that certain urine tests can give a positive result before you have missed your period. In actuality, only 25 percent of pregnant women will receive a positive home pregnancy test 2 days before they have missed their period. You can’t assume you aren’t pregnant by a negative pregnancy test even when your period is already late. Either you need your period to arrive, get a positive pregnancy test or have a doctor perform an ultrasound to definitively know whether or not your are pregnant.
