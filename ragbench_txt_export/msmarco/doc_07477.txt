length is the longest side breadth is the thickness (shortest dimension) width is the dimension equal to a value between the first two This changes when you talk about HEIGHT, Width and Breadth Say you are taking about a dead end wall whose height = 3m and thickness of 200mm spanning across a 6 meters wide road. The length is the width of the road. The height is just the height. the breadth is the thickness. So you can either say it is 6m wide or 6m long. Whether the height is 10m. it will not be called the length. In this case the length/width is the horizontal length and not necessarily the longest.
