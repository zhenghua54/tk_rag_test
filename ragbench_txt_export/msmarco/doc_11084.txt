1 Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that cause hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). 2  Up to 85% of individuals who are initially (acutely) infected with hep C will fail to eliminate the virus and will become chronically infected. 3  Hepatitis C is spread most commonly through inadvertent exposure to infected blood. 1 Hepatitis C is diagnosed by determining levels in the blood of antibodies to the virus and then confirming the infection with other tests for viral RNA. 2  The amount of viral RNA in the blood (viral load) does not correlate with the severity of the disease but can be used to track the response to treatment.
