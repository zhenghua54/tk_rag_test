Patients may also have feelings of shock, fear, helplessness, or horror. These feelings may lead to cancer-related post-traumatic stress (PTS), which is a lot like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a specific group of symptoms that affect many survivors of stressful events. These events usually involve the threat of death or serious injury to oneself or others. PTS has many of the same symptoms as depression, anxiety disorders, phobias, and panic disorder. Some of the symptoms that may be seen in post-traumatic stress and in other conditions include: 1  Feeling defensive, irritable, or fearful. 2  Being unable to think clearly.
