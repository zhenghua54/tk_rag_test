There are volcanoes all over the world. They are above sea level and below the oceans. What a volcano actually is a hole in the Earth’s crust that lava and other Earth debris come out of a lot of the. time or even hundreds of years apart. A lot of volcanoes are in a form of a mountain or a hill that have a crater from past eruptions. Many times, before an eruption, there is activity in the Earth’s surface that make the ground shake or even the crater in the volcano grow. Scientists are getting better at predicting eruptions. This can save many lives.
