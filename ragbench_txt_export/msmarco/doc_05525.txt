In every state except Alabama and Florida, nurse practitioners are allowed to prescribe at least some controlled substances. Controlled medications are categorized into groups called 'schedules' based on their potential for abuse. Muscle relaxers for back pain, nausea medications for vomiting, and migraine meds for headaches. Prescribing is at the core of many nurse practitioner's practice. Unfortunately, the guidelines surrounding this privilege can be difficult to sort through and understand.
