As a general rule, one full-body lift should be provided for approximately every eight to ten non-weight bearing residents and one stand-up lift should be provided for approximately every eight to ten partially-weight bearing residents. The average cost of a mechanical lift can vary from $3,000 to $6,000 per lift. The average cost for a ceiling-mounted lift is approximately $4,000 per room. An effective combination of both floor and ceiling lifts is generally accomÂ­plished with a $50,000 to $60,000 investment per 100 bed facility. A 100-bed facility can expect to spend $25,000 to $30,000 on portable (not ceiling-mounted) mechanical lifts depending on how many residents in your facility require the use of a lift.
