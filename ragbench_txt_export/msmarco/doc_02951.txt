Hyalohyphomycosis is a broad term used to describe infections caused by an increasing number of heterogeneous fungi. When present in infected tissue like the lung, these molds appear as hyaline (colorless or lightly pigmented), septate, branching filamentous fungi that may be indistinguishable from Aspergillus.
