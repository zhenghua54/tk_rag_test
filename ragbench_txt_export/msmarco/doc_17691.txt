Activation of NMDA receptors results in the opening of an ion channel that is nonselective to cations with a reversal potential near 0 mV. A property of the NMDA receptor is its voltage-dependent activation, a result of ion channel block by extracellular Mg 2+ & Zn 2+ ions. This allows the flow of Na + and small amounts of Ca 2+ ions into the cell and K + out of the cell to be voltage-dependent.
