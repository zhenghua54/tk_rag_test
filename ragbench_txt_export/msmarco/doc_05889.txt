We moved here from Northern Neck VA, and the last well we had drilled there cost us $ 7,200 but was 680 feet deep. Before that, our well (~ 330 feet) and septic (pump system for 3 bedroom) in Mechanicsville, VA ran around $ 9,000 - $ 10,000. I have no idea how deep drill wells have to be in this area.
