Reputation: 17. Not 750 sq. ft., but just to give you an idea. I am in an 850 sw. ft. apartment, roughly 5 years old, windows facing North, keep my ac on 82 while at work, 80 when home, and 77 at night. On my first bill, on a 22 day billing cycle it was 304KWh. Roughly 14 KWh/day, so at 30 days, that would be 420 Kwh. 1500 KWh in a 750 sq. ft. apartment, in as mild a month as this April is BAD. Something is really wrong, unless you have bad insulation, old apartment, leaky areas, and keep the AC on 65 all day.
