1 The lipid bilayer is semi-permeable, allowing only certain molecules to diffuse across the membrane. 2  Cholesterol is another lipid component of animal cell membranes. It also serves as a base of attachment for the cytoskeleton in some organisms and the cell wall in others. Thus the cell membrane also serves to help support the cell and help maintain its shape. Animal cells, plant cells, prokaryotic cells, and fungal cells have
