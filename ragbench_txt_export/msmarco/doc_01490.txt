Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity builds homes in partnership with qualifying families and our community. We then sell these homes at no profit with a zero percent interest mortgage to low-income families. Our homes are attractive and well built, with new home prices averaging about $95,000, plus the cost of land.
