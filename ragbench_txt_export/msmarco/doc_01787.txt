20 minutes is the average time that this takes for a meal that includes some fat, some carbs and some proteins. If it is a protein only meal or one that is high in fat, it can take 40 minutes to an hour because the stomach must first digest the proteins into useable carbs before sending them to the bloodstream. Best Answer: It takes only seconds for physical food to reach the physical stomach. However, the feeling of fullness is not determined by the filling of the stomach, but by an increase in blood sugar, which tells the brain you no longer need food.
