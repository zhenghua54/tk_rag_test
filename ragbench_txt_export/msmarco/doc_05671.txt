An ancient Chinese birthday wish is: “May the turtle and crane extend your life.” According to Feng-shui, tortoise in the home is a symbol of luck. At one time a chinese river was flooded for a long time and when they put some tortoise into the river the water level subsided and hence they are considered lucky.
