Report Abuse. When first laid, frogs' eggs are small, pearlescent droplets a couple of millimetres across. They emerge from the female at a rate of one every few seconds, until she has laid 100 or more balls of jelly in the water. A few days more and the vegetarian tadpoles turn carnivorous. In a healthy pond, there is plenty of food for the growing froglets, but if you put too much frogspawn into a clean tank, the tadpoles may end up cannibalising each other. Not a pretty sight for young children to watch.
