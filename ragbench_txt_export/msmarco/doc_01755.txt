Thus, it can be stated that ghee residue as a substrate for SSF better yield gives in comparison to conventional SLF. Ghee residue is produced in large quantity by dairy industries and most of the ghee residue goes to waste [4] , which can be. used as a substrate for large scale production of lipase enzyme. Also the production cost reduced for the lipase would be enzyme, whichfinds applications in wide range of industries. Most of the times, it is considered as a As ghee residue contains 3270% of fats,â€“ it could be used poential substrate for production of lipase [5] . In the present study, solid state fermentation was used for hee residue as a substrate [6] .
