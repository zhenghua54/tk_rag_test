There are over 100 types of HPV and over 60 cause warts on non-genital skin (common warts) and the other 40 are referred to as mucosal, genital type because they thrive only in squamous epithelial cells in the body. Furthermore, these 40 types are divided into two categories of high risk or low risk types. The HPV test on the other hand checks for the virus itself and is used with the pap in women 30 and older, especially if the pap has unclear results. [1, 3, 4, 5] The HPV test, like the pap, takes a sample of cervical cells, which is then hybridized with a specific HPV RNA probe cocktail.
