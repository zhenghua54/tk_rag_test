When taking Macrobid for the treatment of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the typical dosage is 100 mg twice a day for seven days. There is only one standard dose for Macrobid Â® (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystalline), regardless of your age or weight. As is always the case, do not adjust this amount unless your healthcare provider specifically tells you to do so.
