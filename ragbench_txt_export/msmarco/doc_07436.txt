What this means is, whatever your daily calorie maintenance level is, you should be about 20% below it each day. Here’s an example…. 1  Let’s say some person (male or female) had a daily calorie maintenance level of 2500 calories. 2  They’d first figure out that 20% of 2500 is 500 (2500 x 0.20 = 500).
