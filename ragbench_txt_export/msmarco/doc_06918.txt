You can use any oil you like and/or can afford as a sealant. You just moisturize with water or a water-based product then seal with an oil. If your hair is more on the rough/damaged end then apply a leave-in conditioner (you can dilute your go-to with water). But to honest, you can still retain length without a sealent too. Growing up, I had a lot of hair that came to my waist. 2. Using butters or oils as moisturizers. With the exception of a few oils, like coconut oil, that can penetrate the strand — oils and butters will sit on the OUTSIDE of your strand because they are SEALANTS, not moisturizers. Their purpose is to lock in moisture — not apply it.
