Praying mantises feed on insects, mice, small turtles and even snakes. Striking twice as fast as a blink of an eye, praying mantises will slowly devour the unfortunate prey slowly with its ultra sharp mandibles. Praying mantises are actually quite popular pets. Insect enthusiasts can find complete praying mantis care starter kits online and you can also purchase praying mantis nymph eggs from some garden centers.
