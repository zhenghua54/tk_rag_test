Zero Kelvin is equal to −273.15 deg Celsius and -459.67 deg Fahrenheit. When Fahrenheit invented his 212 degree temperature scale it was thought that the absolute zero temperature was just 32 degrees of the scale below the melting point of ice. 39 °C is equal to 102.2 °F and 312.15 K    The conversion formula is Fahrenheit temperature = (9/5 x Celsius temperature)+ 32    The Kelvin temperature = Celsi … us temperature plus 273.15   (the Kelvin scale has its zero point at absolute zero or -273.15 °C).
