Wisconsinâ€™s Amish population has increased at a much faster rate than most over this 20-year period, gaining 150% as opposed to an average of roughly 100% (see Young Center, 2010). Older small communities are found at Blair in Trempealeau County, Spencer in Marathon County, and Chetek in Barron County. Wisconsin is a state which saw Amish arrive relatively late compared to other states associated with the Plain People. Though the first Amish only began to settle in Wisconsin in the early 1900s, the Wisconsin Amish presence has grown to become the fourth-largest in North America.
