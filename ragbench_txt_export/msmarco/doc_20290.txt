Perindopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Perindopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It makes blood flow more smoothly by preventing the production of certain natural chemicals that tighten the blood vessels. Perindopril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take perindopril exactly as directed.
