HbA1c is a common measurement used when assessing diabetes. It stands for Hemoglobin A1-c. The A1c is simply a specific subtype of hemoglobin A. Hemoglobin is a molecule located in your red blood cells that is responsible for holding oxygen. HbA1c is formed when glucose (a blood sugar) binds to the hemoglobin.
