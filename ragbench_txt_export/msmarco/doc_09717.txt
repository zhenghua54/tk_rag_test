Interns at Google typically commit to three months of full-time work, which means the average intern making $6,000 monthly would take home nearly $20,000 after one summer. And the staggering salary is just the beginning. Google employees enjoy a ton of office perks, and interns get in on the action, too. Rohan Shah, a 20-year-old Google intern, gushed to Business Insider earlier this month about his time with the technology behemoth. That's quite a chunk of change -- enough to put Google in second place for highest intern salaries, according to Glassdoor. Only research interns at Microsoft get better pay, pulling in $7,050 per month.
