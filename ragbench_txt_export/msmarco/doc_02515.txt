Among patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), those with poor performance status “seem to have a worse response to chemotherapy,” the authors noted, and the role of concurrent chemoradiation is unclear. Available evidence shows, however, that some patients benefit from standard therapy. “When comorbidities or poor [performance status] exclude surgical interventions for early-stage lung cancer, radiation therapy is the standard alternative” for the management of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
