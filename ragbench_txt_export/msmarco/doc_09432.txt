Welcome to Medina. Located on the West end of Bellevue, and just across the lake from Seattle, Medina makes up a large part of the Lake Washington waterfront, while having just over 3,000 total residents. Medinaâ€™s schools are part of the larger City of Bellevue School District, which is one of the top ranking and award winning school districts in the nation. The City takes safety and security seriously, with highly visible police officers using current technology to create and maintain a safe small town community.
