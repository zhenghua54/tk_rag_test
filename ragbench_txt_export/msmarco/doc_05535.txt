The English term schmaltz is derived from Yiddish, and is cognate with the German term Schmalz, meaning rendered animal fat, regardless of sourceâ€”both tallow and lard are considered forms of Schmalz in German, as is clarified butter. However, English usage tends to follow Yiddish, where it means poultry fat. Homemade Jewish-style schmaltz is made by cutting chicken or goose fat into small pieces and melting in a pan over low-to-moderate heat, generally with onions. After the majority of the fat has been extracted, the melted fat is strained through a cheesecloth into a storage container.
