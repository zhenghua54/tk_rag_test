Throat disorders such as tonsillitis, strep throat, catarrh, laryngitis often have symptoms of mucus in the throat. Viral infections such as chicken pox, measles, mononucleosis, whooping cough or croup may also cause throat mucus. Clearing your throat will help the phlegm loosen or break up in the back of the throat, giving way to the uncomfortable feeling. Mucus problems can be a nuisance, but there are some simple ways to remedy it.
