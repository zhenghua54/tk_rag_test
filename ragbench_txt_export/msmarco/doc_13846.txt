When finished, the Menai Suspension Bridge, with its 580 foot center span, was the longest span in the world. Sailing ships with tall masts could sail under it, a remarkable feature for its day. The bridge was a highpoint of Thomas Telford's career, and proved the effectiveness of suspension bridges. The Menai Suspension Bridge is still in service, more than 180 years after its opening. And despite the improvements over the years, it retains the graceful form of Telford's original design.
