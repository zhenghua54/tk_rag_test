Pink and brown and shaped like a boomerang, the liver is the second largest organ in the body (the skin always steals this glory). It's located just below the right rib cage in the upper right side of the abdomen above the pancreas and the small intestine. The liver has many functions, controlling storage and concentration of nutrients such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, making proteins and clotting factors, and producing bile, a digestive compound.
