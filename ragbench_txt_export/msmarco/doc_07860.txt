The word  ceramic comes from the Greek word κεραμικός (keramikos), of pottery or for pottery, from κέραμος (keramos), potter's clay, tile, pottery. The earliest known mention of the root ceram- is the Mycenaean Greek ke-ra-me-we, workers of ceramics, written in Linear B syllabic script. A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as carbon or silicon, may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, weak in shearing and tension.
