The INR test result is given as a number. There are no units of measurement because the number is a ratio: the ratio of the sample’s Prothrombin Time (PT – a measure of clotting), to the Prothrombin Time of a normal sample of blood. A result of 1.0, up to 1.5, is therefore normal. Share this page: Tweet.
