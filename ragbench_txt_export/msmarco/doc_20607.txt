Char Wallah Tea. Char Wallah Tea, based in Birmingham in the UK, is run by brother and sister team, Andrew and Julie. During his travels to Australia and Asia, Andrew started drinking loose leaf tea and quickly discovered the taste was far superior and more enjoyable than his usual 'cuppa'. What impressed him too was the incredible health benefits of drinking tea.
