When patients are first diagnosed with kidney disease, they are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information they have to learn. Renal disease is complicated because impairment of the kidneys affects many different systems of the body and can result in hypertension, anemia and bone problems. These issues go far beyond filtration of blood, which is one of the kidneys&#039; main functions. The kidneys are also part of the endocrine system because they release a hormone called erythropoitin--abbreviated EPO-- which is responsible for transforming reticulocytes into mature iron-bearing red blood cells.
