Diamond is the ultimate gemstone, having few weaknesses and many strengths. It is well known that Diamond is the hardest substance found in nature, but few people realize that Diamond is four times harder than the next hardest natural mineral, corundum (sapphire and ruby). But even as hard as it is, it is not impervious. 1 Diamond is transparent, Graphite is opaque. 2  Diamond crystallizes in the Isometric system and graphite crystallizes in the hexagonal system. 3  Somewhat of a surprise is that at surface temperatures and pressures, Graphite is the stable form of carbon.
