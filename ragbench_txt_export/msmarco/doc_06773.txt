Recently the company penned a contract for a well in West Africa for $630,000 a day and its Deepwater Pathfinder is the most expensive drill ship in the world. It also signed a three year contract from a consortium of contractors at $460,000 a day in the Q3 of 2009. The exploration was based on oil stains found. But the well turned out to be a dry hole with no oil. Little wonder then that oil drilling is risky and expensive. According to Arizona Geological Survey, Oil drilling in Arizona costs between $400,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the depth of the hole and its location. A rig capable of drilling most exploratory holes typically costs $8,000-15,000 per day
