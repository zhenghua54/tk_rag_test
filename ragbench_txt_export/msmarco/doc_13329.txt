The guitar is tuned in 4ths. The only two strings that are not a 4th apart are the G and B strings. The distance from the G to B strings is a Major 3rd. If you start on the low E string and count up four notes (E F G A) you would land on an A. The distance from the 6th string to the fifth string is a 4th.
