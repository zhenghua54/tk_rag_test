Gestation lasts four to six weeks, once laid you will have to remove the eggs very carefully into an incubator set for 85F the eggs will hatch anywhere from 60 to 80 days, you will have to keep the baby beardies fed on bits of veggies, fruit, and pinhead crickets, they will be a lot of money and upkeep.
