You need a license in all U.S. states and the District of Columbia to practice as a chiropractor. To be eligible for licensure you have to complete at least two years of postsecondary education and four years of chiropractic training at an accredited school. While some schools may offer a 5-year program and others offer 3+3 programs that combine a bachelor's degree with a doctorate, most Doctor of Chiropractic degree programs last four years. You need at least 4,200 hours of clinical, lab and classroom study to earn such a degree.
