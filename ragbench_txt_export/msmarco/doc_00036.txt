The ghost ant is associated with a complex of ant species known as tramp ants that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical latitudes worldwide. In fact, Tapinoma melanocephalum was once referred to simply as the tramp ant.. In the United States, the ghost ant is well established in Florida and Hawaii, and its range is expanding. The ant reached Texas in 1994 or 1995, probably through Galveston on a shipment of plants from Florida (Chenault 1997).
