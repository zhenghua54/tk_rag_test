Best Answer: IQ is not what you should base a surgeon on. If you listen to a surgeon and they explain things to you in a way that you can understand then they're a great surgeon. Some doctors get high up in the vocabulary and the patient can't comprehend them. Surgeons are going to be above average in IQ, but there is no threshold. In fact, being a good surgeon is as much about having good spatial thinking ability and manual dexterity as it is about simple intelligence.
