Right-click the OneDrive icon (The OneDrive icon) in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar, and then click Settings. On the Settings tab, click Unlink OneDrive. Restart OneDrive and sign in with the account you want to use. You'll need to select the location for your OneDrive folder again. If you select the same location, the folders for both accounts will be merged.
