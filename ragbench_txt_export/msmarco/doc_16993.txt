Waves is one common way in which nature expresses the flow of energy through space and time. A pulse is just a special type of wave-a solitary wave. And solitary waves that dissipate a minor amount of energy into the medium, have low dispersion, and are able to maintain their shape over distance are called ' solitons '. A vortex ring is a good and interesting example of a solition. Pulse, on the other hand, often refers to some type of one-time disturbance. Like shaking the spring only once. Of course there will be overlap or ambiguities in these terms. I doubt there's any agreed-upon precise definition of these.
