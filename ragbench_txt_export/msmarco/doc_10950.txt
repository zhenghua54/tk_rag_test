But he's a fast learner. Your baby started listening to your voice in the womb (uterus), and will recognise it after birth (deCasper and Fifer 1980, Kisilevsky et al 2003) . Once born, your baby begins tuning in to your voice and speech patterns to work out what you're saying. When your baby reaches nine months old, he will recognise and respond to his own name (ICAN 2011, Sheridan 2008) . When your baby is about 12 months to 15 months old he'll understand simple requests, such as stop, give it to daddy, or come here (ICAN 2011) .
