1 Disney Death: There are actually 3 of these in this movie. 2  First, in a rare instance where a villain suffers a Disney Death, but is Killed Off for Real later on, after Osmosis Jones and Thrax blew up The Zit, they thought Thrax was dead, but when Osmosis goes to the movie theater, he finds out Thrax is alive. 1 The false eyelash that Shane's friend gives her. 2  In the climax, Ozzy and Thrax duke it out on top of it. 3  Thrax doesn't realize that it's fake until he gets his hand stuck in it...just before it falls off of Shane's eye into a beaker of alcohol. 4  Cue dramatic death scene.
