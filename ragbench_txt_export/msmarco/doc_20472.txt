Believe it or not these are not the first lines of terrible jokes, but real scientific questions with real living answers. Hybrid animals are the offspring produced when two animals of closely related – but different – species breed. The young produced will usually not be fertile, and so hybrid species are not normally seen in the wild. In order for more of these hybrid animals to exist the original two species must be cross-bred again.
