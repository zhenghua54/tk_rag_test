Prokaryotic cells do not contain the extensive network of organelles found in eukaryotic cells. The nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are all absent in prokaryotic cells. Instead, the enzymes in organelles of eukaryotic cells are attached to the plasma membrane that surrounds the cell. Ribosomes. The only true organelles in a prokaryotic cell are ribosomes, which are cytoplasmic organelles. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the ribosomes receives information from the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to create protein.
