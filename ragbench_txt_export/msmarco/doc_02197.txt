IBS Medications. Most IBS patients are initially prescribed an anti-spasmodic drug upon diagnosis, though you may have received a low-dose antidepressant, anti-diarrheal, laxative, or even one of the newest (and thus potentially riskiest) Irritable Bowel Syndrome drugs, Zelnorm, Lotronex, Amitiza, or Linzess. Medications for IBS are simply meant to relieve your Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms. If the first IBS medication you try doesn't help much (or at all), don't be discouraged &#150 there are other options available.
