Licensing Requirements for Contractors. A contractor’s license bond is needed to get a license based on where you perform the work. The bond ensures you follow the rules and regulations of your license. Select the state(s) that you work in below to see the bonds you need to obtain. The owner of a job will often require a bond of their general contractors. If you’re a G.C. required by the owner to get contractor’s bonding, it is recommended that you in turn require bonds of your sub-contractors to guarantee their work performance and payment of all workers and suppliers.
