Downrods range in diameter and length depending on the ceiling fan type and application. Standard ceiling fans include a downrod ranging in length from 3 inches to 6 inches, which is suitable for standard size rooms with a ceiling height of 8 â€“ 9 feet. The wrong height can also result in an ill-fitted looking ceiling fan. A method commonly used to find the right downrod length is the ceiling height minus the height of the ceiling fan, minus the desired hanging height (usually 8 feet).
