Lungworm infection in dogs can be difficult to treat, but there is evidence that appropriate antiparasitic drugs are effective, particularly when combined with surgical removal of the nodules in the trachea. It may be necessary to continue antiparasitic treatment for up to 2 months. Diagnosis of lungworm infection is based on signs, known transmission patterns, and presence of larvae in feces. Examination of the airways with an endoscope (bronchoscopy) and x-rays can be helpful tools.
