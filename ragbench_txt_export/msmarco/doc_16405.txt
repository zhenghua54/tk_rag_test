A grounded system is a system in which one of the current-carrying conductors is grounded. An  equipment grounding conductor  is a conductor that does not normally carry current (except under fault conditions) and is also connected to earth. In some areas, the term earthing is used instead of grounding. A  grounded conductor  is a current-carrying conductor that normally carries current and is also connected to earth. Examples are the neutral conductor in AC wiring and the negative conductor in many DC systems.
