At the outset, you'll pay more on Verizon's new plans than you would have with a two-year contract. But you'll save money each month (see best scenario) and you'll also save money over the course of two years. 2) The other option is to pay your phone off over two years. With smaller data plans, you could actually pay slightly more every month for two years. Still, the old two-year contracts would have made you pay a $200 down payment and a $40 activation fee -- neither of which you need to pay using Verizon's new plans. So Verizon's new plans will still be cheaper in the long run.
