It is recommended that you do not drink while on sertraline/Zoloft. Alcohol is a depressant, and conflicts with your brain whilst taking anti-depressants. However, the affects of alcohol with Zoloft depend on the person for the most part. I have been taking Zoloft for several months, and I drink quite a bit.
