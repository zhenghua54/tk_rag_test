Lipids, or fats, are digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In this lesson you will learn how bile salts emulsify fat so pancreatic lipase can digest it. You will also learn how fats first enter lymphatic capillaries, called lacteals, before entering your blood circulation. Chylomicrons are small globules composed of protein and lipid. The chylomicrons first enter lymphatic capillaries called lacteals before entering the general blood circulation. Fats are used to build cell membranes, make myelin sheathes, insulate the body or as an alternate fuel source.
