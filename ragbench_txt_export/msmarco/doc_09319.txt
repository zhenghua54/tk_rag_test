When you take into account inflation and rising costs, if you bought a new puppy today, Sainsbury’s estimate the annual cost could easily rise by about 20 per cent to £1,418 during its life expectancy, which is on average 13 years. This would take the cost of owning a dog to nearly £18,500 in its lifetime.
