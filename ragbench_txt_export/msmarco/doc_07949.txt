A parachute is a device used to slow the movement of a person or object as it falls or moves through the air. In addition to the fabric canopy, a parachute designed to be used by a person must be equipped with a harness that is worn by the user. Attached to the harness is a container that holds the canopy; often this is a back-pack, but it can also extend low enough for the user to sit on it.
