The World Health Organization is dropping its sugar intake recommendations from 10 percent of your daily calorie intake to 5 percent. For an adult of a normal body mass index (BMI), that works out to about 6 teaspoons -- or 25 grams -- of sugar per day. Many people don't realize much of the sugar they take in are hidden in processed foods, according to WHO. A can of soda may contain up to 10 teaspoons or 40 grams of sugar. They were opened up for public comment through March 31, 2014. The American Heart Association recommends limiting sugar intake to no more than half of your daily discretionary calorie allowance: No more than 100 calories per day for women (about 6 teaspoons) and no more than 150 calories per day for men (9 teaspoons).
