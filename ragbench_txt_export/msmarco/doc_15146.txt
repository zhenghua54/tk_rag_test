Bifidobacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria. They are ubiquitous, endosymbiotic inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, vagina and mouth (B. dentium) of mammals, including humans. Bifidobacteria are one of the major genera of bacteria that make up the colon flora in mammals. Some bifidobacteria are used as probiotics. Before the 1960s, Bifidobacterium species were collectively referred to as  Lactobacillus bifidus
