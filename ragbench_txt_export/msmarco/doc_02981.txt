• mRNA molecules are synthesized from the DNA templates by transcription. • mRNA consists of only one nucleotide chain (single stranded) while DNA consists two chains (Double stranded). • In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose whereas, in mRNA, the sugar is ribose. • mRNA consists the base uracil instead of thymine in DNA. In both DNA and mRNA, genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons. Each codon consists of three bases and encodes for a specific amino acid with the exception of stop codon, which terminates protein synthesis process. DNA.
