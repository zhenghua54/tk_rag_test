Positron emission tomography (PET) uses small amounts of radioactive materials called radiotracers, a special camera and a computer to help evaluate your organ and tissue functions. By identifying body changes at the cellular level, PET may detect the early onset of disease before it is evident on other imaging tests. PET and PET/CT scans are performed to: 1  detect cancer. 2  determine whether a cancer has spread in the body. 3  assess the effectiveness of a treatment plan, such as cancer therapy. 4  determine if a cancer has returned after treatment. 5  determine blood flow to the heart muscle.
