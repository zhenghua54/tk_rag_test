No. Sitagliptin is the active ingredient in Januvia, but it is not a generic version of Januvia. What can be confusing is that, often, the active ingredient of a brand-name drug is referred to as the generic name.. The generic name is different from a generic version of a medicine. In order for there to be a generic version of a medicine, the original medicine must have gone off patent and another company (besides the original manufacturer) would make the product.
