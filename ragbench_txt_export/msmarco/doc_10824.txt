The PPS accuracy level is specified to be 16 m, spherical error probable (SEP). GPS position errors are always about twice as bad in height as along either horizontal axis. This means a horizontal error of about 10 m. The graph below lists the official current level. The graph shows the accuracy levels of all currently available systems. The vertical axis is the expected accuracy or error level, shown both in centimeters and meters. The horizontal axis is the distance along the earth's surface between the reference station and the remote user.
