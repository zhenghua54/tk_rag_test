Answer: Haricot vert is indeed French for green beans. Haricot meaning beans and vert meaning green. French green beans are longer and thinner than most American varieties. They are also more tender and have a more complex flavor. For the most part, they are interchangeable with American green beans which are also called string beans or snap beans. If your recipe specifies haricot vert and you are unable to find them, substitute with the thinnest young green beans you can find.
