The complex dianion is formed with the release of two moles of H + from EDTA, with the indicator being released from the copper ion. The complex dianion has the structure shown in Figure 9.1. Note that the anion completely surrounds the cation, forming six coordinate covalent bonds to copper and a very stable complex. The indicator used for the titration is called murexide. This indicator is highly colored and will complex with the copper ion to give a different colored species. During the titration, the EDTA 2â€“ forms a more stable complex and frees the indicator, which then displays its original color.
