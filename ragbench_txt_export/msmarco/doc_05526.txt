likewise, it is not a good idea to prescribe legend drugs for one's self. i found no state law expressly prohibiting prescribing legend drugs to oneself. an np, however, should never prescribe controlled substances for himself or herself or for family members, as it is expressly illegal in many states. furthermore, drug enforcement administration (dea) numbers are specific to a practice setting, so an np who prescribes a controlled substance for a family member who does not come to the practice setting may be violating 2 laws.
