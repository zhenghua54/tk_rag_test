Complexometric titrations are particularly useful for the determination of a mixture of different metal ions in solution. An indicator capable of producing an unambiguous color change is usually used to detect the end-point of the titration. as it is. formed, which also favors the formation of the EDTA-metal cation complex reaction. product. For most purposes it can be considered that the formation of the metal cation-. EDTA complex goes to completion, and this is chiefly why EDTA is used in titrations /. standardizations of this type.
