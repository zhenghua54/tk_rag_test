PepsiCo begins with Pepsi-invented more than a century ago. Today, we’re Pepsi and so much more with soft drink choices like Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist, Aquafina bottled waters, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana and Naked Juice, Lipton ready-to-drink teas and Starbucks ready-to-drink coffees. CHOICES. Your beverage choices change by the day and sometimes by the hour and PepsiCo is there for you every sip of the way. We offer the variety of beverages you want, ingredients you trust, and package sizes that fit your lifestyle. It’s all about choice and finding the match that’s right for you.
