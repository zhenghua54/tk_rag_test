Temple Baptist Church is a Christian church. We follow Jesus Christ, we teach from the Bible, and we worship God as the creator and ruler of the universe. Through our relationship with Jesus Christ, we are forgiven of our sins, transformed in our lives, restored in our relationship with God who loves us dearly.
