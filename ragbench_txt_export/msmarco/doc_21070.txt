Anything, in quantity. Well, except cane beetles. Introduced to Australia in 1935 as an attempt to reduce the populations of cane beetles, the cane toad Bufo marinus has been an environmental disaster. It has become so widespread and populous mainly because it will eat anything that moves. Baby toads can eat ants, small crickets, or meal worms. I have a baby toad, and she is just now starting to eat moving baby crickets, but before that, I spoon fed her su â€¦ pplement formula which you can find at a pet store, and it is filled with little dead insects that you just feed to your baby toad.
