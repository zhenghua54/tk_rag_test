Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates have the general molecular formula CH 2 O, and thus were once thought to represent hydrated carbon. However, the arrangement of atoms in carbohydrates has little to do with water molecules. Starch and cellulose are two common carbohydrates. Both are macromolecules with molecular weights in the hundreds of thousands. Both are polymers (hence  polysaccharides ); that is, each is built from repeating units, monomers, much as a chain is built from its links.
