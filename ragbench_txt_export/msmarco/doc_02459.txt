Usually if you owe back taxes, IRS will send you a letter to notify you that you owe IRS money. However, if you are not sure, try to call IRS at 1-800-829-1040. Also you can g â€¦ o and visit an IRS local office (if they get one in your city.) For more information, check the related links below. They owe income tax on that, too. And the IRS does not know that you have dependents or have deductions or whatever unless you file a tax return. They need that statement, sworn under penalty of perjury, of your income, deductions, exemptions, credits, and so on to properly calculate whether you owe taxes.
