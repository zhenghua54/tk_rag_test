If it is completely thawed out it should take about 2 hours t 2.5 hours and should be a temp of 160 f to 180 f These are not set in stone everything depends on size of chicken your oven and if chicken is still partly frozen. I uasually bake a chicken at 350 degrees for about 1-2 hours depending on the size, also the chicken should have one of those pop-up things that pops up when chicken is done, remember to baste so that it is not dry. lizzy tee · 9 years ago.
