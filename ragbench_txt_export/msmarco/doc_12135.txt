When urine persistently smells bad or has a foul, strong or unusual odor, it may be caused by an underlying disease, disorder or condition. Urine odor can be a symptom of a variety of conditions, including infection, inflammation, or other conditions of the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra).
