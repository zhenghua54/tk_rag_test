The orchid family (aka Orchidaceae) is the largest flowering plant family on earth with about 30,000 species. It is also one of the oldest plant families – developing about 84 million years ago. Being so old, orchids have had plenty of time to develop into very specialized organisms. LIP. All orchids have a petal that forms a lip. For the pollinator, the lip often serves as a landing pad of sorts. Most orchids turn in the development of the bud so that the lip is at the bottom of the flower but some have a lip at the top and are called “non-resupinate”.
