The RCI timeshare exchange program consists primarily of two distinct processes; the RCI Weeks program, which is the traditional week-for-week exchange system, and the RCI Points program, a global points-based exchange system which is the first of its kind in the timeshare industry. The RCI timeshare relationship is clearly a successful one, as RCI is dependent on a healthy timeshare industry where owners exchange their weeks to travel the globe, and timeshare resorts leverage the benefits of timeshare exchange options through RCI in order to grow their vacation ownership base.
