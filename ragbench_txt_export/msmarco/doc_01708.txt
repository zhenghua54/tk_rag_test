And since the minimum required efficiency of a new freezer rises every few years (along with the ENERGY STAR standard, which is always a cut above the base), a freezer from 10 or 20 years ago will most likely use more electricity. For example, I bought an ENERGY STAR freezer (10 cubic feet) almost 20 years ago. Answers. Best Answer: A 10 cubic foot chest freezer with an ENERGY STAR certification must use less than 315 kilowatt hours per year. Some models use as little as 282 kilowatt hours per year, which works out to about 0.77 kilowatt hours per day. A larger, 15 cubic foot ENERGY STAR chest freezer should use less than 400 kilowatt hours per year, while some use as little as 354 kilowatt hours a year, or just under 1 kilowatt hour a day
