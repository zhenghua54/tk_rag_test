Why do you want to bring periods early? There is no natural way that is effective in your case,all you have to do just wait for it to come by it self, and if your period is irregular ,that means if you was on the pill ,you are having the side effect ,that is all, nothing else. As in your monthly period: Actually, rapid weight lost and weight gain is supposed to effect your period's timing. But that is not very healthy, so i wouldnt request doing it. But if you mean getting your first period: it's puberty, you simply can not controll it.
