To provide improved local services, particularly fire protection, and to be able to secure bond financing, the Community Services District was formed in 1960. With bond funding, the CSD was able to purchase the land for Marinwood Park and to develop the firehouse, park, community center and pool. In 1972, the community again voted to tax itself for the purchase of the ridge of open space bordering the community in order to preserve it from development. The original purchase of 321 acres has grown to 812 acres as additional parcels were purchased and developers were required to set aside land as open space.
