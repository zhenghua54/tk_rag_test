Radiometric dating (often called radioactive dating) is a technique used to date materials such as rocks or carbon, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated when they formed. Example of a radioactive decay chain from lead-212 (212 Pb) to lead-208 (208 Pb) . Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the decay product) via an α decay or a β− decay. The final decay product, lead-208 (208 Pb), is stable and can no longer undergo spontaneous radioactive decay.
