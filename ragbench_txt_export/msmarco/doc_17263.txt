To figure how many kilowatts an appliance uses, take the wattage of the appliance, multiply it by the number of hours used, and divide by 1,000. For example, if a new refrigerator has a wattage of 300, multiplied by 730 hours, and divided by 1,000, it averages 219 kilowatt hours. Ad. The price of a kilowatt hour varies in the US, depending on location and peak usage times, but on average, one kilowatt hour costs about $0.06 USD. Newer appliances are generally built to be more efficient, and the location at which the appliance is placed also affects how much power the appliance will use; most new appliances include information regarding their average usage rate.
