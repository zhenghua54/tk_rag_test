Vaccine Recommendations. Meningococcal vaccines protect against most types of meningitis, but they do not prevent all cases. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for people 11 â€“ 54 years of age, as well as certain high-risk children from ages nine months through ten years. Bacterial meningitis is typically caused by one of three types of bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. Before the 1990's, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading cause of bacterical meningitis.
