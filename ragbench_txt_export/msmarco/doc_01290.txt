9. Talk show host Wendy Williams has scored high ratings and solid spot on TV and radio over the last few years. And that, along with endorsement deals, has upped her net worth from $17.5 million about two years ago to $60 million today.

She's certainly the inheritor of the top spot in this net worth battle, taking over for Oprah, who is no longer a daytime talk show host.
