Anonymous. Prime of life for a beef cow is 5-10 years so average herd age in a well managed herd should be 7-8 years. When I saw recommendations to cull 'old' cows during last year's drought I felt a better recommendation was to cull cows with teh lowest production. 1  or to post comments. We have kept some limo cow to 20 year old an awhile bunch to 18, now ill grant u she mite wean a 400 lb calf, but a few months ago it was worth 750 to 800 dollars. Now she made me 200 to 300.00 dollars maybe more, an she paid for herself 12 to 15 years ago ,so profit per cow is how I do it!!!
