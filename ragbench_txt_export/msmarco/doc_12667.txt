Human Services. The Human Services program prepares you to serve people in need through community social service organizations. Youâ€™ll learn about human behavior and social problems and how individuals interface with systems to address these issues. You'll also learn ways to help people meet their physical, mental, and emotional needs. With a degree in human services, you may become a chemical dependency professional, youth worker, or mental health aide. You can work with nonprofit groups, schools, prisons, and government agencies.
