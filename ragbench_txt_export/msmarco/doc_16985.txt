Wave usually refers to a continuous disturbance. Like if you grab hold of spring and shake it back and forth a lot. Pulse, on the other hand, often refers to some type of one-time disturbance. Like shaking the spring only once. Of course there will be overlap or ambiguities in these terms. I doubt there's any agreed-upon precise definition of these.
