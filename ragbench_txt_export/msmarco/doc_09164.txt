Italian pasta dishes that are served with a sauce (Carbonara sauce) made with cream, eggs, Parmesan cheese, small pieces of bacon and vegetables, such as peas. Although any type of pasta can be used, spaghetti and linguine are most suitable with this sauce. Spinach Sauce may be made as a white creamy sauce or a red, tomato-based sauce. For a white Spinach Sauce, ingredients such as garlic, cheese, fresh or frozen spinach, and seasonings are often combined in a food processor to be blended, but not to the texture of a puree.
