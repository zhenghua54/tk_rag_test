Ethanol fermentation, also called alcoholic fermentation, is a biological process which converts sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose into cellular energy, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as a side-effect. Ethanol fermentation has many uses, including the production of alcoholic beverages, the production of ethanol fuel, and bread baking.
