As you can probably tell by the prices we’ve already given you, Poland is a lot cheaper than the UK. The average price for a pint is around £1.50, a meal at a restaurant costs around £10, and a swanky hotel room is equally reasonable. During our time in Warsaw, for instance, we stayed in the H15 Boutique, one of the most luxurious hotels in Poland, for £70 per night.
