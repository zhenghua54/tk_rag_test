Opioids are perhaps the oldest drug known to man. The opium poppy has been used for pain relief since before recorded history. Most opioids are either illegal or restricted by prescriptions only because they have been found to be highly addictive. However, there is a legal, safe opioid found extremely effective for pain relief that can be purchased over-the-counter.
