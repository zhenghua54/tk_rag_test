For example, if your small business increases notes payable by $10,000 after obtaining a new loan, you would report a $10,000 cash inflow in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement, which raises total cash flow by $10,000. A note payable is a debt that is established with a written agreement, such as a bank loan. The notes payable account in the liabilities section of the balance sheet represents the total amount a business owes on these particular debts.
