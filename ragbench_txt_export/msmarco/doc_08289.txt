Shamash tells Enkidu that when he dies, Gilgamesh will wander the earth, undone by grief. Enkidu is comforted by Shamashâ€™s words and retracts his curse, offering a blessing instead for Shamhat. The next morning, lying on his deathbed, Enkidu tells Gilgamesh of another terrible dream. After Gilgamesh and Enkidu defeat the Bull of Heaven, Ishtar curses them from the walls of the city. Enkidu tears of a haunch of the Bull and throws it at her, telling her he would do the same to her if he could.
