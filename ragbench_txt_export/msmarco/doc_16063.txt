The smaller braincases of extinct species such as Homo erectus indicate that they had a far less developed prefrontal cortex than modern Homo sapiens. The prefrontal cortex governs social control. The brain's prefrontal cortex is responsible for regulating behavior, emotions and social control. Modern Homo Sapiens are believed to have a more developed prefrontal cortex than that possessed by their Neanderthal predecessors. Unfortunately, the PFC is one of the brain regions most susceptible to injury. When the pathways between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain are damaged or altered, serious personality changes can result.
