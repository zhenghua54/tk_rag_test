An .htaccess file is a configuration file which provides the ability to specify configuration settings for a specific directory in a website. The .htaccess file can include one or more configuration settings which apply only for the directory in which the .htaccess file has been placed. In the next example, the .htaccess file is included in the wordpress-website directory which controls who can access the wordpress-site directory. For instance, someone that has access to the htdocs directory might not be able to access the wordpress-site directory due to authentication restrictions.
