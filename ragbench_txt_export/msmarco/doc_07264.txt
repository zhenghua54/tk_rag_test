Also, tenants often attempt to show a landlord's wrongdoings in order to take the focus away from themselves and gain sympathy from a judge. This is why it is important to be a good landlord and never give a tenant an opportunity to argue to stay in one of your rental properties. The compromise for this speed is that the landlord must be absolutely sure that every i is dotted and every t crossed. Lastly, in most situations, an unlawful detainer suit is worth more to a tenant than it is to a landlord.
