According to Entrepreneur, some independent television stations will produce your ad for free if you sign up for a minimum of three months of commercial spots. Local television stations typically charge from $200 to $1,500 to create a 30-second commercial. National commercials produced by an advertising agency cost far more, averaging $342,000 for a 30-second spot in 2008, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
