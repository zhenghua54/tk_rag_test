For most people, on most services, the minimum checkin time is 30 minutes before departure. If you're travelling on a Business Premier ticket (the really expensive ones), or you have a Eurostar Carte Blanche frequent traveller card (lots of journeys in a year), then the minumum checkin is 10 minutes before.
