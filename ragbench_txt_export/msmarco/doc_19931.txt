Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, to the cells that need them. Veins carry blood containing carbon dioxide back to the heart after the oxygen has been given to the cells. Capillaries are the thinnest arteries and veins. They are only one cell wide. As the blood cell passes through the very thin capillary, the cells on either side are given oxygen and carbon dioxide is taken from them. Therefore, the capillaries connect the arteries and veins. Capillaries are smaller extensions of arteries and veins, supplying blood tho the bodies extremities. When the arteries deposit the oxygen and other nutrients through the capillaries, the blood then moves to the veins, which will carry the blood back to the heart.
