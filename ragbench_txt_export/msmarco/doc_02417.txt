TGI Friday's gave us endless appetizers before, but there was that one annoying stipulation that you could only get an endless amount of one appetizer. So if you ordered potato skins, you would have only been able to eat an endless amount of potato skins. Friday's cut that mess out and made it so you can get an endless choice of the appetizers you want in the same sitting.
