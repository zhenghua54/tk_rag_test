Once the tadpoles hatch, the jelly provides food for all kinds of other pond-dwellers. A week or two later, the eggs start to break down, and all that is left is a mass of brown-ish things that could be vegetation, or worms, or something else. In reality, they are young tadpoles. A few days more and the vegetarian tadpoles turn carnivorous. In a healthy pond, there is plenty of food for the growing froglets, but if you put too much frogspawn into a clean tank, the tadpoles may end up cannibalising each other. Not a pretty sight for young children to watch.
