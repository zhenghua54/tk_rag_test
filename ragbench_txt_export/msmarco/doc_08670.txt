Making the world better, one answer at a time. Remove the Ford Ranger automatic transmission drain plug. The drain plug is in the bottom of the transmission. Allow the oil to drain out and replace the plug. Fill the transmission with new transmission fluid. You can start by removing a few of the bolts holding the transmission fluid pan to the underside of the transmission, which will likely allow some of the fluid to drain out. While carefully holding the pan in place, remove the rest of the bolts, and remove the pan.
