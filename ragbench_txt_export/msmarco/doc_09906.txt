Borrelia Burgdorferi. Lyme disease is caused by a number of different strains and species of Borrelia bacteria, generally Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States and Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii in Europe. Depending on the strain of Borrelia, the bacteria will be more or less likely to spread through the bloodstream to distant sites in the body (Wormser, Brisson, Liveris et. al., 2008). When it does spread, it can cause arthritic, neurological, cardiovascular and other symptoms.
