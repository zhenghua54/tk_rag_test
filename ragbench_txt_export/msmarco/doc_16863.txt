ANSWER; The basic steam point of water is when it is heated to a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, 100 degrees Celsius or 373 degrees Kelvin. Prior to the advent of the steam engine, the true originator of modern applications of the water-steam temperature point was Thomas Savery. He invented and patented in 1698 the Savery Pump, a process whereby steam was used to pump water out of mines rather than the previously antiquated method of buckets and bailing.
