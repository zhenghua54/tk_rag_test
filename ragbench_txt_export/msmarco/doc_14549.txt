RECTAL BLEEDING CAUSES. Seeing a small amount of blood after wiping, on the outside of your stool, or in the toilet is most commonly caused by hemorrhoids or an anal fissure. Hemorrhoids — Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum or anus that can be painful, itchy, and can sometimes bleed (figure 1). Bright red blood typically coats the stool or blood may drip into the toilet or stain toilet paper. (See Patient information: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics) .). Anal fissure — An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus, the opening where feces are excreted.
