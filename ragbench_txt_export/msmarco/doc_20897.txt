Demolition firms say Brisbaneâ€™s new dump fees will add $3000 to the average $12,000 to demolish a house and that cost will be passed straight back to home owners. And it will cost up to $5000 extra to build a new home if a block needs to be cleared, they say. Brisbane City Council last night passed new charges that will come into effect for companies using council dumps and transfer stations. The costs do not change for householders taking rubbish to the dump.
