1 Trail riders often choose Quarter Horses which can cost $1,000-$4,000 or saddle mules (half horse and half donkey), which run $1,000-$3,500. 2  Quarter horses are also used for rodeo/barrel racing or working cattle, along with Arabians and Thoroughbreds.

The basic rule of thumb is the more training and experience a horse has, the more it will cost.
