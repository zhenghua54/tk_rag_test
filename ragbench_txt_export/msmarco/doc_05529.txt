here were my suggestions: goose fat pie crust (sub goose fat for butter or lard in pie crust recipe); use goose fat for frying ingredients for wild rice stuffing (sub for bacon & bacon grease); make potted goose with juniper berries (with leftover goose meat, and rendered goose fat) as a cocktail hour centerpiece. Hi, everyone! My son is coming home for Christmas, and we're hoping to cook a goose. I asked on the Twin Cities board where to purchase a goose, and also what to do with the leftover goose fat. The board monitors suggested posting the question here, as well.
