Teres major muscle. is a muscle of the arm and one of six scapulohumeral muscles. It is not part of the rotator cuff. The teres major is a medial rotator and adductor of the humerus and assists the latissimus dorsi in drawing the previously raised humerus down and backward (extension, but not hyper extension). Itâ€™s the largest and the most outermost of the three flat muscles of the outside front of the abdomen. It has limited actions in both flexion and rotation of the vertebral column. One side of the obliques contracting can create lateral flexion.
