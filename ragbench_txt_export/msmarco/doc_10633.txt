Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels. Blood cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). A deciliter is one-tenth of a liter). NCEP defines a desirable total cholesterol level as less than 200 mg/dL, and levels for most women stay in the healthy or desirable range until middle-age. But between the ages of 45 and 55, women's average total cholesterol rises to almost 220 mg/dL. Between the ages of 55 and 64, those levels average 240 mg/dL. 1 If you have heart disease, an LDL level (the bad cholesterol) above 100 mg/dL is considered high, and you and your health care professional should identify steps to bring your LDL-cholesterol level into a desirable range (less than 70 mg/dL), including exercise, diet changes and medication.
