Fertilizing your lawn two to three times a year is one of the best ways to keep the soil's nutrients consistent to grow healthy grass. You should time your lawn mowing carefully after fertilizing to preserve the newly added nutrients within the miniature ecosystem. In this case, you can mow directly after watering. A thorough watering across the entire lawn ensures the fertilizer is deeply embedded in the soil, rather than attaching itself to the grass blades.
