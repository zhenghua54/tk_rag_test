The maintenance required light, or Maint Reqd as it's displayed on the instrument panel, on the Toyota Prius is not to be confused with a check engine light. The maintenance light is designed to come on at service intervals to inform the owner or driver that it's time for an oil change service on the hybrid vehicle.
