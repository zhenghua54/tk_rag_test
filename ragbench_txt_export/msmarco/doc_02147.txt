Cell Membrane Structure. The cell membrane is primarily composed of a mix of proteins and lipids. Depending on the membraneâ€™s location and role in the body, lipids can make up anywhere from 20 to 80 percent of the membrane, with the remainder being proteins. It also serves as a base of attachment for the cytoskeleton in some organisms and the cell wall in others. Thus the cell membrane also serves to help support the cell and help maintain its shape. Animal cells, plant cells, prokaryotic cells, and fungal cells have cell membranes.
