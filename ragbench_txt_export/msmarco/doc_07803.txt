Good news: Roth IRA rules allow you to get around this restriction if you rollover funds from a 401k or traditional IRA to a Roth. There are no income limits for rolling over to a Roth, and no limit on the amount you can roll over. And Betterment is engineered to make any IRA or 401k rollover as seamless as possible. You want to open a Roth IRA to take advantage of those tax-free withdrawals in retirement. But your income is too high (over $129,000 if you’re single or $191,000 if you’re married filing jointly for 2014).
