Do not pour bleach directly on the laundry, it will burn it.   Consider using Oxygen non-chlorine bleach:  -buy concentrated or ultraconcentrated Sodium Percarbonate in bleach in powder form. You get the best cleaning for least money. The cheap brands contain a lot more fillers than the concentrated kind. Add one cup of bleach to a large load of white laundry.  Use hot water.  If laundry comes out yellow, it means your water contains too much iron, which rusts in contact â€¦ with bleach and yellows your laundry. Should this happen, stop using chlorine bleach, try Oxy.
