The Protocol requires a seller to prepare a draft contract incorporating the Standard Conditions of Sale (Fifth Edition) (SCS) and discourages the use of further clauses when using the standard form of contract (see paragraph 24(1) in Stage B of the Protocol). Where title to the Property (or part of it) is unregistered, it may be convenient to annex the epitome of title to the contract (see Annex 3). For a form of epitome that may be used for this purpose, see Standard document, Epitome of title (www.practicallaw.com/5-383-5260) .
