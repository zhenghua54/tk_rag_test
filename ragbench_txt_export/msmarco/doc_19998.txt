In biochemistry, a consecutive series of chemical reactions (where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction) form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction.
