In physics, the Coriolis effect is the apparent deflection of moving objects when the motion is described relative to a rotating reference frame. Because the Earth completes only one rotation per day, the Coriolis force is quite small, and its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean.
