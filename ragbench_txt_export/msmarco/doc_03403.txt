Medical tourism may raise broader ethical issues for the countries in which it is promoted. For example, in India, some argue that a policy of 'medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses' will lead to a deepening of the inequities already embedded in the health care system. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical services that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that arenâ€™t yet approved in the home country, abortion, and doctor-assisted suicide.
