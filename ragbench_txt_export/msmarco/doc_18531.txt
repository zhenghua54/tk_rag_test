History. The actual term 'happening' was first used in 1959 by the American artist Allan Kaprow (b.1927), whose later book 'Assemblage, Environments and Happenings' (1966) influenced a wide range of contemporary art events. In Japan, Happenings as types of performance art, were exploited during the 1960s by the Gutai Group-the avant-garde art group founded by Jiro Yoshihara in Osaka in 1954.
