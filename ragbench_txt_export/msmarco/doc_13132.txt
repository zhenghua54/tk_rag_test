A diploma in nursing is an entry-level nursing degree. This means that completing a nursing diploma program can make you eligible for sitting in the NCLEX, the mandatory examination for getting a license as a registered nurse. An associates degree in nursing meets all requirements for a higher nursing education so you have the flexibility to pursue a BSN degree if you want. The nursing diploma program, on the other hand, does not. This difference is particularly important if you have plans in advancing your degree in the future.
