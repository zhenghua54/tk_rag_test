Where does Amber come from? Baltic amber is mainly found in the areas surrounding the Baltic Sea which is why it is called “Baltic” amber. Resin has been found in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Belorussia and as far west as the United Kingdom. Baltic amber accounts for over 90% of the world’s known amber today; however, amber is found all over the world including Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Amber is not to be confused with sap, which flows through the tree's heartwood to transport nutrients to the tree. Resin has a syrupy consistency and piney fragrance, which comes from chemicals known as terpenes (a naturally-occurring hydrocarbon).
