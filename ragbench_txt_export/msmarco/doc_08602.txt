Now incorporated as Saracens Ltd, the club was established in 1876 as the Saracens Football Club. As well as competing in the Aviva Premiership, of which they are the reigning champions, Saracens are the current holders of the Anglo-Welsh Cup and also compete in European rugby cups. The club's colours are black and red. Special games played at Bramley Road during this period include the 1971 match against a select International XV. It was a fantastic occasion, as a 5,000 strong crowd (the largest ever to watch a rugby union game in North London at the time) came to watch a magnificent contest, ending Saracens 34 International XV 34.
