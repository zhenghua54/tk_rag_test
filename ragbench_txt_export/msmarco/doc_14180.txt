Eluxadoline is a mu-opioid receptor agonist; eluxadoline is also a delta opioid receptor antagonist and a kappa opioid receptor agonist. The binding affinities (Ki) of eluxadoline for the human mu and delta opioid receptors are 1.8 nM and 430 nM, respectively. The binding affinity (Ki) of eluxadoline for the human kappa opioid receptor has not been determined; however, the Ki for guinea pig cerebellum kappa opioid receptor is 55 nM. In animals, eluxadoline interacts with opioid receptors in the gut. Coadministration of a single dose of 100 mg VIBERZI with a single dose of 500 mg probenecid resulted in a 35% and 31% increase in eluxadoline AUC and Cmax, respectively, compared to administration of VIBERZI alone. This change in eluxadoline exposures is not expected to be clinically meaningful.
