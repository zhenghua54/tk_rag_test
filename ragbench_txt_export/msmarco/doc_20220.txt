A very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their own. A full stomach can be caused by: 1  Eating too much food too quickly. 2  Drinking too much alcohol. 3  Swallowing too much air. 4  Smoking. 5  A sudden change in stomach temperature, such as drinking a hot beverage and then a cold beverage.
