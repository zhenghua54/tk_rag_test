A decrease in body temperature, in fact, occurs at night in relation to the sleep cycle in human populations [58,59]. A fall in body temperature occurs during starvation, as noted above, and in hypoglycemia, an acute state of energy deprivation [60-62]. Raising core temperature by 1Â°C is associated with a 10% to 13% increase in metabolic rate [41]. During starvation, a fall in body temperature occurs, contributing to the decrease in metabolic rate noted in this state [24].
