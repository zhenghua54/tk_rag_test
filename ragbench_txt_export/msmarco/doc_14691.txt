My Personal Dosing. I personally use 1 teaspoon of MSM powder 2 or 3x a day PLUS 1/4th teaspoon PURE Vitamin C Powder. The PURE Vitamin C (not synthetic/ascorbic acid) enhances the absorption and effectiveness of the MSM and is a wonderful antioxidant. We suggest you do not use synthetically produced MSM. The organic sulfur we use and offer on our shopping cart is very well absorbed. The precise dosage is not real critical, since MSM is a macro mineral food. Personally I started with one tsp 3x per day and NOW take one tsp 2x per day.
