Basa fish are farmed along the Mekong Riverâ€”one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Large manufacturers planted along this river frequently dump extremely toxic and dangerous chemicals and industrial waste directly into it. Shrimp is a very clean animal, it can not live in dirty water. Most Shrimp, Basa fish, and Tilapia fish are farm raised in the delta of Mekong River in Vietnam. If the farmer can raise shrimp there: the water of the river is not dirty. Mekong River flow rate is about 50000 cubic meter/second, a lot of water, my friends.
