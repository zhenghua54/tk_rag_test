My definition is: A noun phrase is either a pronoun or any group of words that can be replaced by a pronoun. For example, 'they', 'cars', and 'the cars' are noun phrases, but 'car' is just a noun, as you can see in these sentences (in which the noun phrases are all in bold). Because the noun phrase is a quintessential part of every sentence (even if it doesn't appear in the surface structure of a sentence as in stop!), it is potentially infinite in length, and it can include any number of other phrases (e.g. noun, adjective, adverb) within its structure.
