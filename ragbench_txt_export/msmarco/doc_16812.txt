Robert Hooke is the scientist that is usually credited with the discovery of the cell. He was the first to use the word cell, because the first cells he observed looked similar to monk’s cells. He observed cork cells and published his findings in a book called Micrographia in 1665. He discovered many different types of cells including bacteria, sperm, muscle fibers and protozoa. He was also made the first description of a red blood cell. It wasn’t until 1839 that Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden co-founded the principal of cell theory.
