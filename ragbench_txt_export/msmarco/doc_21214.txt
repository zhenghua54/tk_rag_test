Arthrography is medical imaging to evaluate conditions of joints. It can either be direct or indirect. Indirect arthrography is a medical imaging technique in which contrast material is injected into the blood stream and eventually absorbs into the joint. With direct arthrography, however, the contrast material is injected directly into the joint. Direct arthrography is the preferred method because it is better for distending or enlarging the joint and imaging small internal structures, thus allowing for better evaluation of diseases or conditions within the joint. 1 Direct arthrography is particularly effective for detecting disease of the structures within the joints such as ligaments, tendons and cartilage. 2  This is particularly true for the shoulder in the setting of shoulder dislocation and in the hip, wrist and elbow.
