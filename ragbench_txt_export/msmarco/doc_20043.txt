The most common endogenous cause of Cushing's syndrome is Cushing's disease. Frequent clinical findings include weight gain, truncal obesity, striae, hypertension, glucose intolerance and infections. The syndrome is most commonly caused by the therapeutic administration of exogenous glucocorticoids. 1 The term “Cushing's disease” is reserved for Cushing's syndrome that is caused by excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) by a pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma.
