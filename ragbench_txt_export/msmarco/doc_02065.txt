Yes | No Thank you! Not everyones belly is hard during pregnancy sometimes it depends on how big the baby is &nd some times it just don't get hard my first kid wasn't hard and she came out perfect but if you feel like something is wrong go see your doctor ! posted 08/01/2013 by a BabyCenter Member.
