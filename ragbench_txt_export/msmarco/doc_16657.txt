Aldi's £42,000 starting salary for graduates as City banks offer £50,000 to student job hunters. 1  Average starting wage for university leavers at Britain’s 100 leading employers will exceed £30,000 for the first time ever this year. 2  Aldi is offering the most generous declared wage outside of the City. Almost a third of graduate jobs at these firms now pay more than £35,000, with four well-known investment banks offering basic salaries of between £45,000 and £50,000. The figures come amid the best prospects for student job-hunters in a decade.
