In France, goose fat is sold in tins or jars (jars are more flexible for daily use as they can be re-sealed.) In some parts of France, everyday cooking is still based on goose fat in the way that other parts of Europe rely on butter or oil. Brown fat is the fat that you get while roasting a goose; it renders off the goose as a by-product of the roasting. Blonde (actually more white) fat is rendered in a saucepan. Either kind is spreadable like butter, and has a smoke point of 375 F / 190 C.
