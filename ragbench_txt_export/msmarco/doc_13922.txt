Physician assistants work under the supervision of a doctor, surgeon, or medical professional to provide support to a healthcare or medical team. Often an exciting career, physician assistants are required to have an advanced education and extensive training in a medical setting. Certified physician assistants need to take the Physician Assistant National Recertifying Exam (PANRE) during the last two years of the six-year certification maintenance or the 10-year certification maintenance cycle.
