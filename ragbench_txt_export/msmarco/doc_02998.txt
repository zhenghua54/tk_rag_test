Morganite, the sister stone to emerald and aquamarine, didn’t always have a special name. For many years morganite was known simply as pink beryl. Morganite is a member of the beryl family, along with emerald, aquamarine, heliodor and goshenite. Typically free of inclusions, it has a good hardness rating on Mohs scale (7.5 – 8) as well as good toughness.
