1. The Schlieffen Plan was Germany’s tactical solution for avoiding a two-front war with France and Russia. 2. Under this plan, drawn up in 1905, France would be forced to a quick surrender by a German invasion in the north. The Germans embraced a workaround to this impasse called the Schlieffen Plan. It was named for its inventor, Count von Schlieffen, who constructed the plan in 1905 after studying the Russian military’s performance in its ill-fated war with Japan (1904-5).
