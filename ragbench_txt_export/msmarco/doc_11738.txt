These are carbohydrates with more than two basic types of sugar molecules, usually between three and ten basic units. Their main role in the body is to store glucose. Raffinose and stachyose are the main types of oligosaccharides which consist of repetitive chains of fructose, galactose, and glucose. Let us take a look at all the types of carbohydrates and their functions. Simple carbohydrates have a 'simple' molecular structure and are made of 1 or 2 sugar molecules. Simple carbs can be digested very quickly due to their simple structures, and tend to elevate the blood sugar quickly.
