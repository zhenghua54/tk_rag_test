Plumeria rubra L. is the most commonly grown Plumeria species in Florida and in many warm climates. Its native range is from central Mexico to Colombia. The tree grows from 15 to 25 ft tall. The ﬂowering period of P. rubra is from March to July. In the past, ﬂower colors of Plumeria rubra were considered distinct species but are now regarded as different forms of the same species. All forms have twisted overlapping corollas, much like the blades of a propeller. Forma acutifolia has white ﬂowers and yellow centers. Forma lutea has yellow ﬂowers.
