Disaccharides contain two sugar molecules. Ideally, they come under oligosaccharides (since oligosaccharides contain two to ten sugar molecules). However, due to their comparatively simple chemical structure, disaccharides are classified as a different class of carbohydrates. Let us take a look at all the types of carbohydrates and their functions. Simple carbohydrates have a 'simple' molecular structure and are made of 1 or 2 sugar molecules. Simple carbs can be digested very quickly due to their simple structures, and tend to elevate the blood sugar quickly.
