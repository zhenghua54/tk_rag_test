If using cooling racks, line cookie sheets with aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Core, then slice 4 apples as paper thin as possible (a mandoline slicer is helpful if you have one). Spread the apples in a single layer on top of the parchment paper or cooling rack. Sprinkle lightly with a cinnamon/Splenda mix.
