I use miso most often as a glaze for fish. I cook the miso paste with mirin (sweet rice wine) and rice vinegar for a few hours, reducing the mixture down until it's sweet and almost syrupy. Then I braise sea bass in a thin paper pouch made of cedar soaked in water so it doesn't burn out in the oven.
