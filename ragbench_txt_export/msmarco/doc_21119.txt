This shrimp-family member resembles a miniature lobster and is wild-caught from Virginia to the Gulf of Mexico, along the coast of California and in the Caribbean. The name comes from the thick, rock-hard shells that are immensely difficult to remove by hand. Rock shrimp range in size from 25 to 110 per pound and most are sold sans shell (both fresh and frozen). They're available frozen year-round and are generally available fresh from July through November, peaking in September.
