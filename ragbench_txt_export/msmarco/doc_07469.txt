The Bactrian Camel (or Camelus bactrianus) is a large even-toed ungulate native to the steppes of north eastern Asia. It is one of the two surviving species of camel. The Bactrian Camel has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped Dromedary Camel. The Bactrian Camel will eat snow in lieu of scarce water in the Gobi Desert. The Gobi and the surrounding region sustains many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, marbled polecats, bactrian camels, Mongolian wild *** and sandplovers, and are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves.
