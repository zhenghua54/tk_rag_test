Wash your avocados first. Even though you will not use the skin, when you cut through the skin with a knife germs and bacteria can transfer onto the knife which can go through to the meat of the fruit and contaminate it. When the avocado is cut, the flesh turns brown because of oxidation. You can freeze mashed fresh, ripe avocados if you want to have an emergency supply of avocados on hand for guacamole. Now you can buy them in bulk and FREEZE them! So stock up on avocado when you see a sale at your grocery store. The texture of the avocado is the same as a fresh avocado once it thaws.
