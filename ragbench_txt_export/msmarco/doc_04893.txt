During his ministry, angels came and ministered to Jesus after he had resisted the devil's temptations (Matt 4:11). Again, when Jesus was submitting himself to God's will in the garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:40-44), an angel came from heaven to strengthen him. The angels of the presence of God, who do not appear to correspond to our conception of guardian angels, are specially interested in God's little ones (Matthew 18:10). Finally, the existence of angels is implied in the Lord's Prayer in the petition, Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth (Matthew 6:10).
