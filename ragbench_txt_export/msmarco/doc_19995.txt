There are several factors that can influence chemical reaction rate. In general, a factor that increases the number of collisions between particles will increase the reaction rate and a factor that decreases the number of collisions between particles will decrease the chemical reaction rate. For solids, the shape and size of the reactants makes a big difference in the reaction rate. Presence of Catalysts and Competitors. Catalysts (e.g., enzymes) lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction and increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process.
