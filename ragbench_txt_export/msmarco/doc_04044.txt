Autumn Rains. April and May are the autumn months in Cape Town, and some of the wettest. Temperatures are similar to spring, but days may feature heavy downpours. It doesn't rain every day, however-and when it does, it's the perfect opportunity to explore Cape Town's museums and restaurants. Cape Town's Climate. Cape Town has a Mediterranean style climate, with warm summers and mild, quite wet winters. Because of the surrounding mountains, Cape Town has many microclimates, and some parts of the city receive dramatically more rainfall than others.
