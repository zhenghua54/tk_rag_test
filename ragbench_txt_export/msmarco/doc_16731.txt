Examples include autocrine, where the cell signals to itself, and paracrine, where a cell signals to a nearby neighbour. However, when cells need to communicate a message over a long distance, they can use the endocrine system. Endocrine signalling uses chemicals called hormones to send messages throughout the body. The hormones are released from the cell into the bloodstream and can travel around the entire body. There are many types of hormones-the chemicals which are responsible for endocrine signalling. Like most signalling pathways, hormones will bind to receptors on specific cells. This will produce the desired response within the cell.
