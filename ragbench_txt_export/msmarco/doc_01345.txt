In California, a judgment is valid for 10 years, and can be renewed indefinitely. Other States vary from 7 to 25 years. (Federal judgments expire either in 20 years, or at the same time a state judgment would expire-in the state where the Federal judgment was obtained.). Almost always, if a judgment expires, and was not renewed-it is worthless.
