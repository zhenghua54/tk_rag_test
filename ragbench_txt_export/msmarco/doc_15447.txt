Needless to say, installing and/or making concrete is a job better left to the pros, but if you are up for a DIY challenge, you will certainly save some dough. According to our concrete slab material estimator, the average minimum cost per square foot of a concrete slab is $1.36 and the maximum is $1.88. By comparison, the price per square foot for a cement slab is $5.50. Just know that even if you do not hire a pro, there are additional costs that come with all concrete slab projects. Supplies, such as the wood used to shape the concrete, can add $3.75 per square foot.
