According to Forbes, the cost of goods sold should be between 25 percent and 40 percent of revenue. That is a large range; however, your menu will dictate your profit margin. Expensive food such as filet mignon or salmon will cost more per pound so, for your sandwich shop, your costs can be much lower. Don't skimp on the menu items that will be your specialties, and consider what store-bought items you will make from scratch such as sauces and breads.
