The second stage consists of the actual delivery of the puppies. The third stage is passing of the placenta. The afterbirth might pass with each individual puppy, usually within 15 minutes of delivery. If the mother has a few puppies in rapid succession, those placentas may come out en masse. The final placenta should appear within half an hour of the last puppy's birth.
