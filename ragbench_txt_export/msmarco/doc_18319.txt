Types of Conduit. PVC conduit needs to be buried at least 18 inches deep unless it will be covered by concrete, in which case it can be buried 12 inches deep. Rigid metal conduit can be buried as little as 6 inches deep, with or without a concrete cap. Be sure to check with your local code before you start installing underground cable.
