The Puritans left England so they could practice their religion freely. They settled three colonies in New England, Plymouth Colony (1620) and the Massachusetts Bay Colony (16 â€¦ 30), both in Massachusetts, and the Connecticut Colony in (1636). 15 people found this useful. Some people say they came because they wanted religious freedom, but that's not really correct, because they believed their way of worship was the only right way and did not allow people who believed something different to worship as they saw fit. The Puritans settled only in the New England region.
