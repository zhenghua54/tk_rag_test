The Allegory of the Cave (also called the analogy of the cave, myth of the cave, metaphor of the cave, parable of the cave, and Plato's Cave) is presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work the Republic (514a–520a) to compare the effect of education (παιδεία) and the lack of it on our nature . The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun (508b–509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d–513e).
