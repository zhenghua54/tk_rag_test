Knowledge center. Epiglottitis is inflammation (swelling) of the epiglottis-a flap located at the base of the tongue which stops food from going down the wrong way into the windpipe (trachea) when we are eating. As the epiglottis sits in a crucial place for proper breathing, if it becomes swollen it can cause serious breathing difficulties and is treated as a medical emergency. In some cases, epiglottitis can completely close off the windpipe and the patient cannot breathe, known as respiratory failure.
