The IRS takes 10 to 14 days on average to process refunds. That is based on the date your return is accepted by IRS not the same as e-file date. You should recieve some form of notice your return was accepted. If you owe money somewhere in the IRS computer they should adjust the amount of the refund and deposit it. Best Answer: Check out this IRS efile chart and see when to expect your refund: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2043.pdf If you do owe the IRS money from a previous year, then they will deduct what you owe them and send you the remaining balance as your refund.
