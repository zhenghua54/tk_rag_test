There are three major types of blood vessels, and these are the arteries, veins and capillaries. Arteries, except for the pulmonary artery, carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the different parts of the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles while the smallest veins are called the venules. The capillaries are connected to the arterioles and venules. It is important for the capillaries to be thin and small to be able to transfer of nutrients and other matters.
