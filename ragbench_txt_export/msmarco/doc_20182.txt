Structural formulae of fructose (left) and glucose (right). High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, isoglucose and glucose-fructose syrup) is a sweetener made from corn starch that has been processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. Corn syrups, including HFCS, are made from corn starch. Commercial production of corn syrup began in 1864. In the late 1950s scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company in Iowa tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable.
