The word landscape (landscipe or landscaef) arrived in England —and therefore into the English language —after the fifth century, following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. An early form of landscape poetry, Shanshui poetry, developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D. Shanshui poetry (or Shanshui chi, traditional Chinese: 山水詩; simplified Chinese: 山水诗 lit. mountains and rivers poetry) refers to the movement in poetry, influenced by the shan shui (landscape) painting style.
