There are many factors which determine the cost of a postal money order. The amount for which the money order is purchased will have a direct impact on the amount of money that a person needs to spend in order to purchase this universally-accepted method of payment. Currently, money orders which cost $500 or less will cost $1.25. Money orders which are for $501 to $1000 will cost $1.65. This does not include insurance or tracking on the item itself. A military issued money order will only cost 35Â¢. This is advantageous to military families who are constantly moving and need to be able to provide a secure payment method for their needs.
