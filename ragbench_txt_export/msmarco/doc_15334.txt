On roll-up doors, the spring tension is controlled by a cable on a pulley. To adjust the tension, pull the cable and reknot the end to shorten or lengthen the cable. Sometimes the problem with your garage door can be traced to the opener. In the following section, we'll show you how to replace a garage door opener. Swing-up garage doors move on horizontal tracks. The power spring is mounted on the door frame and hooked to the door. Caution: If a roll-up door has only one torsion spring, at the center of the door, do not try to repair it. The tension is so great that the spring could injure you. For doors with this type of spring, call a professional repair service
