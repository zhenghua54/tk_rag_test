How much a TV presenter makes per year depends on years of experience, the employer and the location. A presenter with less than a year’s experience can earn from $20,500 to $50,500. With up to 10 years’ experience the range is $41,000 to $82,000 and up to $113,000 with 20 years’ experience. Large companies like CNN, CB, Fox and the ABC pay higher salaries while California and New York pay higher than Texas.
