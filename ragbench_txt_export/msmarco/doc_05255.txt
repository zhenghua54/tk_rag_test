By Gerald Erichsen. Definition: In a technical sense, two words that have a common origin are cognates. Most often, cognates are words in two languages that have a common etymology and thus are similar or identical. An example of such a change is the English word arena, which usually refers to a sports facility, and the Spanish arena, which usually means sand.. They both come from the Latin harena, which originally meant sand and came in time to also refer to an area of a Roman amphitheater that was covered with sand.
