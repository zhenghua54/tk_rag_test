It is presumed that antibodies are initially formed against NMDA receptors found within tumours, and then attack similar-looking receptors in the brain producing the symptoms and signs associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Tumour removal is a very important part of treatment.. What is known is that most tumours associated with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis contain neural tissue (tissue containing cells identical to that found in the brain), and NMDA receptors.
