Homer (Glyptothek, Munich). In the Odyssey, the legendary blind poet Homer describes many countries and islands in the seas west of Greece, visited by the prototypical traveler Odysseus after the fall of Troy. Among these islands was one that was inhabited by Cyclopes, one-eyed giants that liked to devour human beings.
