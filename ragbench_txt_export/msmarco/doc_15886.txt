24 to 48 Hours. You should wait at least 24 hours before grouting the tiles. You may notice that the edges of the thinset or the thinset showing through the grout lines looks dry. Don't be fooled by this. The thinset under the tiles isn't receiving as much air as the edges and is therefor not fully cured.
