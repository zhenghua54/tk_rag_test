As an architect, Gropius believed that a building should be at the centre of the teaching of all the arts, hence the name Bauhaus (House of Building) and in 1925 the Bauhaus moved from Weimar to Dessau and into a new purpose-built home which reflected the core Bauhaus values. The Bauhaus was founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919 by architect, Walter Gropius with the aim of bridging the gap between art, design and industry and unifying all three.
