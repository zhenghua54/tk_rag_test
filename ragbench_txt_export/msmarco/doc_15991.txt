Foods rich in beta-carotene include those that are orange or yellow, such as peppers, squashes, and carrots. However, a few studies have found that people who take beta-carotene supplements may have a higher risk for conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Beta-carotene is also used to color foods such as margarine. In the body, beta-carotene converts into vitamin A (retinol). We need vitamin A for good vision and eye health, for a strong immune system, and for healthy skin and mucous membranes.
