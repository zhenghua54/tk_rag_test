Buff is a very vague term used for a wide range of pale yellowish-browns. It originally meant a type of leather with this colouring (again in a wide variety of shades). If … using oil paints I would start with white, add a very little yellow ochre and maybe a tiny amount of raw umber or raw sienna. Marcus Buff Bagwell, is a pro wrestler best known for his time in WCW, his one match on WWE Raw, after which he went briefly to X Wrestling Federation, World Wrestling … All-Stars, and then to TNA, which he left in 2006.
