Barclays Bank has closed my Bank account!!! Hi all, I am hoping someone here has had a similar experience and can recommend a solution. In short, I found out today by my folks in the UK that Barclays Bank have closed my Uk Barclays Bank account. There was over 2,000 pounds sterling in my account when I left the UK in January 2010.
