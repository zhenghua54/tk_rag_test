The important design considerations described below are a key to specific amplification with high yield. The preferred values indicated are built into all our products by default. 1. Primer Length: It is generally accepted that the optimal length of PCR primers is 18-22 bp. This length is long enough for adequate specificity and short enough for primers to bind easily to the template at the annealing temperature. 2. Primer Melting Temperature: Primer Melting Temperature (T m) by definition is the temperature at which one half of the DNA duplex will dissociate to become single stranded and indicates the duplex stability. Primers with melting temperatures in the range of 52-58 o C generally produce the best results.
