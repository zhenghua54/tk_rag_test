A federal background check may also include a credit history. A credit history is often required for security clearance with a government agency or government contractor. According to the FBI, a poor credit history may not disqualify you as a job candidate. Any company can require a background check as a condition of employment. However, only you can request a copy of your criminal history summary from the FBI. You will be notified whether or not you have a criminal history.
