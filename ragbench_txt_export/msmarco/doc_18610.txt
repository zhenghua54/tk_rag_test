Urethroplasty is a surgery where the urethra is reconstructed to cure problems like urethral strictures. The types of surgeries are varied and depend upon the location, cause, and length of the stricture. When patients return to clinic the bladder is filled with x-ray contrast and the catheter is gently removed. While x-rays are being taken, the patient voids and the area of the surgery is evaluated. If the area of surgery is healed, then the catheter is left out and patients begin to void normally.
