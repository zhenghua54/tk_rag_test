Asters vs. Orchids…. Orchids are debatably the largest flowering plant family on Earth (30,000+ species). The only other contender for that title would be the aster family, Asteraceae, which is a much later development in terms of evolutionary history (42 MYA). This family includes asters, dandelions and daisies. LIP. All orchids have a petal that forms a lip. For the pollinator, the lip often serves as a landing pad of sorts. Most orchids turn in the development of the bud so that the lip is at the bottom of the flower but some have a lip at the top and are called “non-resupinate”.
