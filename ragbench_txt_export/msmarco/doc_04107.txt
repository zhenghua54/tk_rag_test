Now, most of the time this is going to be correct, but on first hearing about the dark room problem my reaction was that actually I sometimes do just want to lie in a dark room. I suffer from periodic bouts of depression, and during these depressive episodes a dark room is pretty much all I can cope with. It also fits well with predictive processing and the dark room problem. Predictive processing has already been applied to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and other delusions (in the form of false error signals), and similarly I think we could say that in some cases the dark room problem simply isn't a problem.
