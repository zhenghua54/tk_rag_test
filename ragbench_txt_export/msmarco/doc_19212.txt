Types of Jaundice in Newborns. Jaundice in newborns, which produces a yellow color to the skin and eyes, is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). In the womb, a fetus obtains nutrients and eliminates by-products, such as bilirubin, through the umbilical cord. After birth, the baby's organs take over these jobs.
