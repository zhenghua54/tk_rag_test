After years of hemming and hawing, the Food and Drug Administration has finally declared artificial trans fats a threat to public health, giving food companies until June 2018 to phase out partially hydrogenated oils, the primary source of trans fats in processed foods. Originally seen as an alternative to saturated fat, trans fat gained popularity in the 1940s and still has many uses in the modern food industry, maintaining the vibrancy of sprinkles and the buttery flakiness of biscuits. Since 2006, companies have been required to include trans fats on dietary labels.
