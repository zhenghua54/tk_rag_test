This is a test derived from another, the prothrombin ratio. It measures the extrinsic clotting pathway system, commonly used to measure warfarin (blood thinning) drugs. A normal, healthy person will have an INR of 1. In warfarin therapy, an INR is usually aimed for around 2. INR is the international normalized value for prothrombin time. It is a value that measures the extrinsic pathway of clotting, and is often used to determine how quickly the person will make clots. It is often used to determine if the patient is on therapeutic doses of blood thinners
