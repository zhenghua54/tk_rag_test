The function of the lungs is to Oxygenate the blood so as to ensure constant and effective supply of oxygen to the whole body. The deoxygenated blood from the right side of the Heart is carried to the Lungs. At the level of the Alveoli's, the air exchange takes place where carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen taken up. This blood is then carried to the left side of the Heart and pumped to the whole body via the Aorta !
