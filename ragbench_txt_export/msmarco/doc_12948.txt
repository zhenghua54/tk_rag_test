Conventional concrete setting times are bit more subjective. Assuming that optimum temperatures are present during pouring and setting, you can *possibly* walk it in 24 hours, but gently. I like to wait 48 hours to be on the safe side. It will take 7 days to reach 2,500 lbs. The only stupid question is the one not asked. Not only can you get DIY advice at the Chatroom but a bit of Chinese philosophy as well. ****************************. The fast setting concrete answer is easy. You can walk it in 2 hours and set heavy objects in 4 hours.
