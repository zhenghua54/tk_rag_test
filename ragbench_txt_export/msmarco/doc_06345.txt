Like many other early information technologies, EDI was inspired by developments in military logistics. The complexity of the 1948 Berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem, vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. In EDI terminology inbound and outbound refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document.
