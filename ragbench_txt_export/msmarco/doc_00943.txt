A vascular plant is vascular because it has tubes and roots that br â€¦ ing water and nutrients to where they shoulod go. A nonvascular plant is nonvascular because it does not have roots or tubes to bring water and nutrients, which is why nonvascular plants are a lot shorter than vascular plants. Phloem tissue carries sugar from the leaves to other cells of the plants. Non vascular plants are plants that lack tissues that transport water, nutrients, and sugar. Some example of non vascular plants are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
