Well, you'd never mistake a rabbit for a mouse, but the fact is, not all rodents do look like that. Some rodents, such as beavers and porcupines, are much larger than rabbits, or, in some cases, even hares. However, that's going by the scientific meaning of the word 'rodent'. In everyday speech, I've heard the term applied to a even wider range of animals, including such things as shrews, but, most commonly, rabbits. Yet rabbits, along with hares and pikas, are not rodents.
