Cost of Attendance Tables. The California State University (CSU) makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Official university tuition and fees can be found on the Student Account Services website. Amounts in the cost tables are shown are for full-time enrollment for the 9-month academic year. Less than full-time enrollment may change your award amount.
