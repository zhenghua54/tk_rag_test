In reply to: Turning on using KB/Mouse. Using the keyboard you can turn-off your pc or put it into sleep or hibernate mode but you cannot turn on with your keyboard. Since there is no power to the keyboard until you press the power switch: then the BIOS initializes the keyboard and loads a keyboard driver. You can modify or jerry-rig the keyboard or mouse with a switch to operate a rely inside the Case which in turn operate the on-off switch of the computer. Power can be independent battery power. Yes, it is possible. Come to think of it, you can even switch on by wireless remote control.
