The oral typhoid vaccine is administered four times, two days apart, with the last dose taken at least one week before travel. This vaccine lasts for up to five years, after which a booster dose is given for people who plan to continue their travels or who are otherwise considered at risk for getting typhoid fever. The injection lasts only two years compared with the five years of protection offered by the oral typhoid vaccine. After two years, a booster shot is needed for people who plan to continue traveling in countries where typhoid is common or who are otherwise at risk.
