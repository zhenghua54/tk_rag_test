Sciatica -- pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve. Sciatic nerve -- this runs from your low back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg. Piriformis muscle -- located on the front part of your body in the hip area. Hip flexor -- a group of muscles that help you move your leg from the hip. (CNN) -- Sciatica is a real pain in the butt -- and, sometimes, in the leg and foot. That's because the sciatic nerves, the longest nerves in your body, run bilaterally from the base of the spine through the deep muscles of the buttocks and all the way down the back of each leg.
