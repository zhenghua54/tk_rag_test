The Purpose s of a Memo The primary goals of a legal memorandum are to educate the reader about the law relevant to a particular issue and to explain how that law will apply to specific facts. A memo presents an objective analysis of the law, not a persuasive argument intended to advocate on behalf of a client. This guide summarizes general advice for first-semester students on how to write a memorandum of law. In the fall semester, the small-section memo writing project is designed to give you some initial experience with writing in the larger context of a doctrinal course.
