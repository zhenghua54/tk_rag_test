An endospore is a dormant, tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by certain bacteria from the Firmicute phylum. The name endospore is suggestive of a spore or seed-like form (endo means within), but it is not a true spore (i.e., not an offspring). It is a stripped-down, dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself. Examples of bacteria that can form endospores include Bacillus and Clostridium. The endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy.
