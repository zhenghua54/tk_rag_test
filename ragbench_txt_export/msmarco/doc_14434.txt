The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project dishes up a hearty banquet of data that illuminate the roles of the functional elements of the human genome. Here, six scientists describe the project and discuss how the data are influencing research directions across many fields. The latest chapter in our story is ENCODE; an ambitious project which aims to characterise all the functional element in the human genome. This animation shows how ENCODE is the next major step along this path.
