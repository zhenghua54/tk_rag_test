Closed kitchen for me, but I do spend some time out front shmoozing tables and running the occasional plate. The dress code is really relaxed. As long as your wearing a chef coat, you're good to go. I usually wear black jackets, black Dickies, black shoes, and a black skullcap/commis hat. When I had my own place it was short sleeve coats for all the cooks that I provided, checks and black shoes. Taste: The sensation derived from food, as interpreted thru the tongue to brain sensory system. Flavor: The overall impression combining taste, odor, mouthfeel and trigeminal perception.
