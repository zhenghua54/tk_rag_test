A bleeding disorder is a condition that affects the way your blood normally clots. When you get injured, your blood normally begins to clot to prevent a massive loss of blood. Sometimes the mechanism that causes the blood to clot fails, resulting in rapid or prolonged bleeding. Other conditions that can cause bleeding disorders are: 1  liver disease. 2  low red blood cell count. 3  vitamin K deficiency. 4  medication side-effects.
