Intensive Outpatient Treatment (also known as IOP for Intensive Outpatient Program) is a primary treatment program recommended in some circumstances by a clinical and medical assessment. IOP may be recommended for those who do not need medically-supervised detox. With an outpatient program like the IOP offered by The Counseling Center at Freehold, you continue to live at your own home. You remain in control of your own life. You can still go to work or get a job, and begin rebuilding your personal life, with the help and support you receive from the program.
