The voltage between two points is equal to the electrical potential difference between those points. It is actually the electromotive force (emf), responsible for the movement of electrons (electric current) through a circuit. In other words, current is the rate of flow of electric charge. Voltage, also called electromotive force, is the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field.
