Step 1. Grease the cookie sheet with baking spray and set it aside while you preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Step 2. Open the package of chicken breasts and pat the tops dry with a paper towel. Pull each chicken breast out and pat the bottom dry before placing them on a plastic cutting board. Step 3. Slice the chicken into long, thin strips -- no wider than a quarter-inch -- with the sharp knife, cutting with the grain of the meat to produce chewier jerky. Remove any fat and discard it. Place the chicken strips on the greased cookie sheet, making sure none of them touch and there is space for air to circulate between each piece. Step 5. Place the tray in the oven and bake the strips. Check them at two hours, although it may take three to six hours to complete the drying process.
