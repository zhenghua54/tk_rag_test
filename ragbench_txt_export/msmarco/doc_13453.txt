Platelets are important elements in the blood that are important for blood coagulation (clotting and prevention of bleeding). The normal platelet count ranges between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter). Although the number of platelets is decreased, their function may remain intact in most cases of thrombocytopenia. All blood cells (white cells, red cells, and platelets) are made in the bone marrow
