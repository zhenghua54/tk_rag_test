Homologation is the process of certifying that a particular car is roadworthy and matches certain specified criteria laid out by the government for all vehicles made or imported into that country. Homologation in India is expensive and time consuming because the authorised body often has to begin by buying the equipment required to test technology-rich cars. Also, the rush for certification means that the authorities sometimes don't have the capacity to handle the volumes.
