You will need a valid passport for the period you will be holidaying in the UK. Your passport must also show you are from a country that is participating in the Working Holiday Visa Programme with the UK. You will also need to prove you do not have any dependents with you, unless they are a partner with a Working Holiday Visa valid for the same period of time. To apply for a UK Working Holiday Visa, first check to see if your country of origin is a participating country in the visa programme, at the UK Visa Bureau website. It is possible that countries outside of the list on the Visa Bureau website are included in the programme.
