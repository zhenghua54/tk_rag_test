Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes beta-and gamma-synuclein. Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain and alpha-and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively. SNCA may serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking. 1 This is a review on two human amyloidogenic polypeptides, one associated with Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), and the other important for melanin synthesis, the repeat domain (RPT) from Pmel17.[Review]. 2  Our results do not support a role for common SNCA genetic variants in risk for essential tremor.
