EIA projects the retail price of heating oil to average $3.63 per gallon (gal) this winter heating season (October 2014-March 2015), which would be $0.25/gal lower than the average price during the winter of 2013-14 (Figure 1). This lower heating oil price reflects EIAâ€™s forecast for a lower Brent crude oil price. EIA projects the retail propane price during the winter heating season in the Midwest and Northeast to average $0.62/gal and $0.18/gal lower, respectively, than the winter 2013-14 average. The market for heating fuels is highly dependent on winter temperatures. If temperatures are 10% colder than forecast on a heating-degree-day basis, EIA projects average expenditures will be $124 lower and prices will be $0.16/gal lower than last winter.
