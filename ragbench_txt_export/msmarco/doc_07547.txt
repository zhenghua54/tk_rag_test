Morris Michtom, owner of a Brooklyn toy store, was inspired by the cartoon to make a stuffed bear cub. Intending it only as a display, he placed the stuffed bear in his toy store window, and next to it placed a copy of the cartoon from the newspaper. To Michtoms surprise, he was besieged by customers eager to buy.
