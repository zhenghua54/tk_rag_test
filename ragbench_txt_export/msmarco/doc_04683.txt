RR Lyrae stars are less massive than Cepheids but they also follow their own period-luminosity relationship, with a mean absolute magnitude of +0.6. They are thus useful in determining distances to the globular clusters within which they are commonly found to a distance of about 200 kiloparsecs. This in turn allows us to determine the distance to such stars and is discussed in more detail on the next page. As with non-pulsating variables, there are several types of pulsating stars and some of the key types are described briefly below.
