Kangaroos are herbivorous and the female kangaroo has a pouch for the joey (baby). Kangaroos are well known for their jumping capabilities and use their tails to help balance. A kangaroo cannot jump if its tail is lifted off the ground. There are over 60 varieties of kangaroo, from the largest, the Red kangaroo, through many varieties of wallabies, and down to the smallest member of the kangaroo, the musky-rat kangaroo. It depends on the species. The animals most commonly known as  kangaroos are herbivores, primarily eating grass and other  vegetation. Besides grass, they eat young shoots a â€¦ nd tender leaves  of native shrubs. They enjoy grains as well, but being herbivorous,  they do not eat any other animals.
