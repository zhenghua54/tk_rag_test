All types of muscles consist of muscle fibers. Striated muscle fibers in skeletal muscles form bundles joined together by layers of connective tissue. The ends of muscle fibers are intertwined with tendon fibers, and through this combination muscular tension is transmitted to the skeletal bones. The combination of a motor nerve and the group of muscle fibers that it innervates is called the motor unit. Each branch of a motor nerve in a motor unit extends to a separate muscle fiber. All the muscle fibers that constitute such a unit contract almost simultaneously when they are excited.
