Costs can vary significantly by region, as the same master suite addition costs an average of $137,840 in a high-cost urban market. Choose upscale finishes and a bit more space and your new bedroom costs could skyrocket, with an average price of $224,989 for an upscale master suite addition as of 2014. The National Association of Realtors suggests you can save 20 to 60 percent by building your new bedroom over your porch, garage or a previous addition instead of adding on to your home.
