4. Cook the roast: Put the spit on the rotisserie and start it spinning. We’re cooking the roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 110°F for medium-rare. (Cook to 100°F for rare, 120°F for medium.) This will take roughly 2 1/2 hours, but the time will vary – go by temperature, not by time. One hour before cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator. If you don’t have time to salt the roast overnight, you have two choices. 1. Salt the roast one to two hours before cooking, and rest at room temperature until it is time to grill. An hour will give you enough time to get a bit of the dry brine effect.
