It began to look as if oxytocin was implicit in sexual fidelity, and that prairie voles were a model for human love, but paternity tests on prairie voles found that up to a quarter of the litters had not been fathered by the life partner. In humans, oxytocin is produced in the hypothalmus; it is released from the posterior pituitary gland. There are receptors in many parts of the brain, as well as elsewhere in the body, such as the reproductive system.
