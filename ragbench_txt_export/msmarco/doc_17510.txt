Best Answer: Basic Pasta: INGREDIENTS * 1 egg, beaten * 1/2 teaspoon salt * 1 cup all-purpose flour * 2 tablespoons water http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Basic-Pasta... A simple recipe for fresh pasta calls for two large eggs and about 1-1/4 cups of all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked al dente (Italian: to the tooth, meaning not too soft). Abroad, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour (such as farina), but this yields a softer product, which cannot be cooked al dente.
