There are many uses of radioactive isotopes. Two of the most common include carbon dating to discover how old fossils and other historical organic (including carbon) artifacts â€¦ are and uses of radioactive isotopes in medicine. Radioactive isotopes in medicine are used to help diagnose certain disease states and isolate regions in the body. The rate at which a parent isotope decays to its daughter isotope is considered one half life. Carbon-14 has a half life of 5730 years and its daughter isotope is Nitrogen-14.
