Direct democracy (also known as pure democracy) is a form of democracy in which people decide (e.g. vote on, form consensus on) policy initiatives directly. This differs from the majority of modern Western-style democracies, which are indirect democracies. Direct democracy is similar to, but distinct from, representative democracy in which people vote for representatives who then enact policy initiatives.
