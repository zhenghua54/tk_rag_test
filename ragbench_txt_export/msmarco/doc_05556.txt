A starting salary for a presenter who has no experience is likely to be shockingly low even £0. Yes that’s £0. Outside of the breakfast show slots largely the smaller radio stations can vary in their salary averages from £25 per show to £80 per show. In these cases a starting programme fee equivalent might be in the region of £100-£200 per programme.
