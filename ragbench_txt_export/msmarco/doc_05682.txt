Iâ€™ve been a personal trainer for 24 years and was formerly a physical director of a YMCA. I have owned a private studio in my home for the past 11 years, and I work strictly with women one-on-one. My fees are $45 per hour for a package of five sessions or $50 for a single session. A session once a week costs $75, twice a week costs $60 and three times a week costs $50. If clients want or need to do a 30-minute session, I charge them $40 for once a week, $35 for twice a week and $30 for three times per week.
