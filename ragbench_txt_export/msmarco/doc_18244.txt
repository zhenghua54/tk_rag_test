The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of-depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealised soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of German art-modern, abstract, non-representational-or as the Nazis saw it, degenerate. Many people also came because of the air of scandal around the show-and it wasn't just Nazi sympathisers who found the art off-putting.
