colormap name sets the colormap for the current figure to the built-in colormap specified by name. The new colormap uses the same number of colors as the current colormap. The figure colormap affects all axes in the figure, unless you set an axes colormap separately. Return the colormap values for a specific axes by passing its axes handle to the colormap function. Create a figure with two subplots and return the axes handles, ax1 and ax2. Add a filled contour plot to each axes and use a different colormap for each axes.
