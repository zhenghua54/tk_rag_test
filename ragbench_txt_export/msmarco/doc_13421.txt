I have been called Jenna all my life,but I answer to both. I love my name, when I was born, Jenna wasn't a popular name, so not many people my age have the same name as me. Also my middle name is Sarah which means princess, so the meaning of my name is pure, fair princess. And honestly especially for a girl like me, it can't get any better than that
