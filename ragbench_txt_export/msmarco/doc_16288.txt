China is a culture of flowers. Its traditional art and customs are infused with symbols and habits that pertain to flowers. Even the name of Chinese people, hua ren, when spoken in a different tone could mean “flower people”. Most ancient paintings depict flowers of some kind, most often the plum blossom and tree peony.
