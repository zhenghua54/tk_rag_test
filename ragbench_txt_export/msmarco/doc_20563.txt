Prolactin has a wide range of effects. It stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation): increased serum concentrations of prolactin during pregnancy cause enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and prepare for the production of milk. There is a diurnal as well as an ovulatory cycle in prolactin secretion. In many mammals, there is also a seasonal change in prolactin release. During pregnancy, high circulating concentrations of estrogen and progesterone increase prolactin levels by 10- to 20-fold.
