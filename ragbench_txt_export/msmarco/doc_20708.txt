Testing Center. The most popular method for becoming a personal trainer is by taking a test at a monitored testing center. First, obtain the course material from the fitness organization and then schedule to take a test at a testing center close by. This process can take about six to eight weeks depending on the individualâ€™s experience and knowledge, and the scheduling of the exam.
