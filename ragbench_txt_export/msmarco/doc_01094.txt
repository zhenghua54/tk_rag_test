We asked how much student debt is okay, and how much is too much. One in five senior citizens and almost a quarter of adults between the ages of 35 to 49 agree that $20,000 to $50,000 in student loan debt is too much to borrow. Maybe that's because they are in the age range of folks in a position to hire young people. Maybe it's because college didn't used to cost so much. More than half of all student loans are now delinquent or in deferral, according to a recent study by TransUnion. Further, according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of Education, over 13 percent of graduates default on their loans within three years of leaving college.
