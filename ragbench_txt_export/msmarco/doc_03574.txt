Simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells of this type of tissue can withstand more trauma than simple squamous epithelia and are adapted for diffusion and secretion. This is one of the specializations found in epithelial tissues. Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in organs that are specialized for secretion, such as salivary glands and thyroid follicles, and those that are specialized for diffusion, such as the kidney tubules. As its name implies, this tissue consists of a single layer of cuboidal cells on the basement membrane. Examine simple cuboidal epithelium in a section of the kidney. Simple cuboidal epithelial tissue lines the tubules, which will be seen in both longitudinal and cross sections. Find longitudinal and cross sections of the tubules using the mid-magnification view.
