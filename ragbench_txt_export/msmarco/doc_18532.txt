Happenings occur anywhere and are often multi-disciplinary, with a nonlinear narrative and the active participation of the audience. Key elements of happenings are planned but artists sometimes retain room for improvisation. This new media art aspect to happenings eliminates the boundary between the artwork and its viewer. The first appearance in print was in Kaprow's famous Legacy of Jackson Pollock essay that was published in 1958 but primarily written in 1956. Happening also appeared in print in one issue of the Rutgers University undergraduate literary magazine, Anthologist.
