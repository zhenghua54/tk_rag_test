If the driving behaviour is serious and could result in immediate harm to others call 911 and make the report immediately. If this is not the case, a call to the police non-emergency number as soon as reasonably possible is sufficient. After you have provided the particulars of your case, ask for and record the file number of your complaint. I'm sure that we've all felt that way at one time or another but haven't followed through because we didn't know if it was worthwhile or if anything would happen to the offending driver if we did. Here is what you need to know in order to make an effective driving complaint to police in BC.
