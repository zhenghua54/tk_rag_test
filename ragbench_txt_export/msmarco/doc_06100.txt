The audio adapter cable can be used with the HDMI cable. If both cables are plugged in, the Xbox 360 console transmits audio over the audio adapter and video over the HDMI cable. This gives you flexibility if you want to connect the HDMI port to your HDTV, and you want to route audio to a non-HDMI device. Description. The Xbox 360 HDMI Cable connects the Xbox 360 console to a high-definition TV that is equipped with an HDMI port. The HDMI cable can be used only on an Xbox 360 console that is equipped with an HDMI port. Note HDMI cables that are not produced by Microsoft will work with an HDMI-equipped Xbox 360 console.
