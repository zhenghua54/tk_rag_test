1 Installed onsite by professionals, terrazzo floors might cost $20 to $100 per square foot. 2  Accounting for this large price range is the scope of the job (smaller jobs tend to cost more), the level of detail (custom patterns demand significantly more, as well as skilled, labor), and the exact components of the aggregate. 1 A typical residential job (say, a 15’ x 15’ kitchen) might only cost $25 to $50 per square foot (or, roughly $5,500 to $11,000). 2  Terrazzo tile, at around $15 to $30 per square foot installed, is a much more affordable option.
