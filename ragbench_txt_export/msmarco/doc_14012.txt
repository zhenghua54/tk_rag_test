A pacemaker in VVI mode denotes that it paces and senses the ventricle and is inhibited by a sensed ventricular event. The DDD mode denotes that both chambers are capable of being sensed and paced. 1  Persisting symptomatic bradycardia. Dual-site atrial pacing. 1  Newer pacing systems have two atrial leads, one in the right atrial appendage and the other either in the coronary sinus or at the os of the coronary sinus. 2  The ventricular lead is in the right ventricle, either at the apex or at the outflow tract.
