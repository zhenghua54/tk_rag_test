Menopause is the period in a woman's life when the ovaries stop releasing eggs and the uterus stops producing and expelling the lining that it makes monthly to support a fertilized egg. This means the end of monthly menstruation and a whole new slew of symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and vaginal dryness. Menopause symptoms may come on slowly, although you have successfully delayed early onset menopause. Do not be ashamed of an occasional hot flash or mood swing. Realize that it is part of being a woman and you are simply entering a new phase of life with many benefits.
