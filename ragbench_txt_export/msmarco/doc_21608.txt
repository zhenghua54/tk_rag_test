Capodimonte porcelain figure, c. 1790. Bisque porcelain or bisque is a type of unglazed, white porcelain, with a matte appearance and texture to the touch. It has been widely used in European pottery, mainly for objects that are not tableware and so do not need a glaze for protection. Small figurines and other decorative pieces have often been made in bisque, as well as larger portrait busts and other sculptures; the appearance of bique is very similar to that of carved and smoothed marble, the traditional prestige material for sculpture in the West.
