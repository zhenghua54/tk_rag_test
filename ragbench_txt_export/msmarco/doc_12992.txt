Determining the cost of an air ambulance, either by helicopter or small plane, isnâ€™t straightforward; there are no national requirements regarding fees, which can range from under $12,000 to more than $25,000 for a short flight. While it is true that transportation to a medical facility via an air ambulance may save your life, it is also true that you will end up burdened with a lifetime of debt for the trip.
