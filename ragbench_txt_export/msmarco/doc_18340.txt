*** Plan for additional expenses that will increase your cost of attendance. For undergraduates, we estimate the average annual cost of books and supplies to be $1,804, transportation to be $1,454, and personal expenses to be $1,392. If these amounts match your personal situation, then you would add them to the overall cost of attendance listed above.
