Pulmonary Surfactant. Surfactant is a complex substance containing phospholipids and a number of apoproteins. Surfactant reduces surface tension throughout the lung, thereby contributing to its general compliance. Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex formed by type II alveolar cells. Bottom left: the phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC). Center right: sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) AOT is a rare surfactant-it is soluble and active in both oil and water. Botton right: pentaethylene glycol monodecyl ether (C12EO5), a non-ionic surfactant. Top of Page.
