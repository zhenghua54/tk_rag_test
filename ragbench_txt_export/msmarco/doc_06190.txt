However, if your mortgage was a refinance loan, you must typically spread the deductions over the life of the loan. For example, if your origination fees equal $4,500 for a 30-year loan, you can deduct $150 each year for the next 30 years. Most lenders charge a basic origination fee equal to a certain percentage of the loan balance. Lenders may also include points in their origination fee, which are one-time prepaid interest payments you make in exchange for a lower annual rate.
