Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate PO3− 4 is required for all known forms of life, playing a major role in biological molecules such as DNA and RNA where it forms part of the structural framework of these molecules. The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen – hence its name given from Greek mythology, φωσφόρος meaning light-bearer (Latin Lucifer), referring to the  Morning Star , the planet Venus (or Mercury).
