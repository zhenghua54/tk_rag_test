I know that the Japanese Spitz only comes in White and that the German Spitz comes in various colours. There really isn't much difference unless you're looking for very subtle differences. So unless you're a breeder, cynologist, or dog showperson, it really doesn't matter. All Spitz are generally the same. German Spitz can also be a category of dog as opposed to a single breed. If you really want in-depth information, I would suggest going to www.AKC.com and searching for those breeds, looking them up on Wikipedia, or flipping through Dogalog (dog encyclopedia)
