Whether you have a gas or electric water heater, the default temperature set from the factory will be between 120ºF to 140ºF. It is estimated that the average water heater temperature is set to 130ºF in the United States. Increasing your water heater temperature by just 10ºF from 130ºF to 140ºF may increase heat loss resulting in a larger electric bill from $30 to $75 dollars annually. Setting the temperature to 140ºF can also increase demand losses resulting in an annual expense of up to $500 dollars.
