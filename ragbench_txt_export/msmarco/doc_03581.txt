Stroma is everything else -- connective tissue, blood vessels, nerves, ducts. The parenchyma / stroma distinction provides a convenient way to circumvent the listing of tissue types when discussing an organ. Examples: 1  The parenchyma of the kidney is epithelial tissue (renal tubules and corpuscles). 2  The blood vessels, nerves, and supporting connective tissue of the kidney comprise the stroma. 3  The parenchyma of the spleen is connective tissue (mostly lymphocytes and other blood cells).
