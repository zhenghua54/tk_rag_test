The barrier function of the blood–brain barrier is due to: (1) tight junctions that restrict movement of substances between the endothelial cells, (2) specific transport proteins that determine which substances can cross the barrier transcellularly and (3) enzymes that may degrade or alter substances prior to passage. Figure 1. The blood–brain barrier consists of endothelial cells lining brain capillaries. These cells are connected by tight junctions, which separate the plasmalemma into luminal (blood‐facing) and abluminal (brain‐facing) plasma membrane domains.
