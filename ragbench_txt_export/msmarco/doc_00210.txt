Sitagliptin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 17, 2006, and is marketed in the US as Januvia by Merck & Co. On April 2, 2007, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin and metformin marketed in the US as Janumet. There have been several postmarketing reports of pancreatitis (some fatal) in people treated with sitagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors, and the U.S. package insert carries a warning to this effect, although the causal link between sitagliptin and pancreatitis has not yet been fully substantiated.
