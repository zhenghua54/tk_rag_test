Basalt is the opposite of granite. Basalt is a mafic (dark coloured minerals rich in iron and magnesium)fine grained rock formed from the rapid cooling and crystallisation of lava above ground. Granite: Pale coloured, felsic, intrusive, coarse grained/porphyritic. Basalt is the foundation of oceanic crust. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock made from visible mineral crystals, a result of cooling over a longer period of time under the surface of the Earth. Another difference between basalt and granite include their joints.
