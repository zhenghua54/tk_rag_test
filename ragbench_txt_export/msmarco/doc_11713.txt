Despite a central government law making it mandatory for all two-wheeler riders to wear helmets, women in Delhi have been exempt from the rule since 1999. Zubeda Begum, counsel for the government, told the court that they are now willing to take another look at that exemption. Now it has decided to have a relook and make necessary amendments.. The government's position represents a turnaround from their stance for most of the last decade when they did not feel it necessary to make helmets compulsory for women on two-wheelers.
