I paid $141(not incl. taxes) for my last dental visit, which was basically a dental cleaning and an x-ray. They gave me fluoride ($13) to rinse my mouth after the cleaning but they didn't tell me to not rinse my mouth with water after, but I did, so there went $13 down the drain... Literally!! I was so annoyed.
