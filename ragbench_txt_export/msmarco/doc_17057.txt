Conditions for Germination. Watermelon seeds need nutrient-rich soil and lots of water to germinate and thrive, as over 90 percent of the fruit is made of water. Adding mulch will help the soil retain its moisture and reduce weed growth. For a healthy seedling to sprout, watermelon seeds must be planted in temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees. Position the seeds no more than 5 feet away from each other, so the seedlings have room to mature into large fruit.
