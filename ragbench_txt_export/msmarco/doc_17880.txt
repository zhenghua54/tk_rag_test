If you keep potatoes in the fridge they should not be stored at temperatures below 7 째C (45 째F). If, that is, you intend to use them for roasting for frying. At lower temperatures the starch in the potato breaks down giving a burnt look and a bitter taste after roasting. According to Keeping Food Fresh by Janet Bailey: Some foods need temperatures warmer than your refrigerator but cooler than your pantry. Fresh potatoes and winter squash for example keep best at a temperature of around 50째F. to 55째F.
