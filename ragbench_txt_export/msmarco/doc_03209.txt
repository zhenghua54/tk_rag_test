Cephalexin is prescribed to treat respiratory tract, middle ear, skin, bone, and urinary tract infections (UTI). It's also used to prevent infections caused by streptococcal bacteria, including prevention of rheumatic fever. Cephalexin isn't recommended for sinus infections. Cephalexin and other cephalosporin antibiotics are broad-spectrum antibiotics, meaning they're used to treat a wide range of infections caused by many different bacteria.
