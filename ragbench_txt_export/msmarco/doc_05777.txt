Treatments last anywhere from 15 minutes to one hour, as the time depends on the area being treated and the thickness of the hair. Your doctor or technician will usually have the laser penetrate the skin for a few minutes in an area about the size of a quarter and check if you have a negative reaction before continuing. When you are thinking about laser hair removal, you will find you have many questions about the process before you have any treatment preformed. A vital piece of information is how long does laser hair removal last. Although, this can be different for everyone, the short answer is forever.
