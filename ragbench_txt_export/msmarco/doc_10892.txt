You'll have access to this incredible restaurant for employees only-- we were brought there by friends who worked there-- can't remember the name but the good is fantastic and better prices than restaurants in the city. Re: Bank for International Settlements BIS-Salary. It's tax free because it's not 'in' Switzerland. The buildings are, technically, in foreign territory. As a consequence I've heard that some people face even more complicated issues about what permit is granted. It's also run by the most evil people on the planet..
