The use of windbreaks is a well established tool for canker management throughout the world. A proven plant species for this purpose is Casuarina cunninghamiana, judging from its common to almost exclusive use in the fresh fruit citrus industries of Argentina, South Africa, and Australia. Florida researchers have also studied possible commercial uses of Casuarina and concluded that because of its fast growth, coppicing abilities, and wood properties, the plants are suitable for use in pulpwood and biomass production (Comer et al., 1986; Rockwood et al., 1983).
