Section 21 notices. For a start, before you can use the accelerated procedure at all, you need to have served an notice seeking possession on the tenant under section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. The minimum notice period you can give is two months. When the Judge does this will depend on how quickly he does his ‘box work’. This may vary depending on how busy the court is. However in my experience, assuming all goes well, you can expect to get the order back in the post about six to ten weeks after posting off the application.
