Most chai wallahs prepare their chai in small batches on a per-order basis. In large cities, however, the chai business is often divided into one central chai wallah, who makes enormous batches of chai, and sellers, who take and fill orders from local shops. For the chai delivery person, the faster he can move on foot through the crowded city streets, the more chai he can sell. A wallah is one who performs a specific task. A rickshaw wallah drives the rickshaw, a dhobi wallah washes clothes and the chai wallah, you guessed it, makes chai. Chai wallahs are everywhere in India. Everywhere.
