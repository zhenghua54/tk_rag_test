When buying orchids, the most common varieties are the phalaenopsis (moth orchid), the vanda, paphiopedilum (slipper orchid), or the dendrobium (Singapore orchid). Many decorative forms of orchids are grown specifically to be used as cut flowers. Despite being native to tropical regions, orchids actually don't need that much watering. For best results, water the plant every five to 12 days, depending on the type of orchid, the temperature it resides in and what time of year it is.
