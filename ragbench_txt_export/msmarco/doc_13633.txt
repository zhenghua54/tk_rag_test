Medicaid is a reimbursement source for about 40 percent of the clients of the centers. Effective primary care can reduce specialty, emergency and inpatient cost. Ku said studies show individuals who use community health centers have a 24 percent reduction in annual health care costs. Matt McKillop a senior research associate from The Pew Charitable Trusts said improper Medicaid payments cost the states $11 billion in 2010. He said the eye-popping amount led Pew to establish its Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse database, www.pewstates.org/Medicaid-fraud.
