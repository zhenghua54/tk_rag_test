One of my favorite plants is satin pothos. While it is easy to grow and beautiful in my home, it took lots of research to discover the plant's true identity. At first I thought the plant was a philodendron. Its growth habit is much like Philodendron hederaceum, so it made sense to me that it was a satin leaf form of philodendron.
