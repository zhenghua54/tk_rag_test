The cause is Bacillus Cereus (pronounced B.Serious which makes it easy to rememberâ€¦ but take it seriously, this is no joke). Cooked rice should be cooled rapidly, and stored in a clean, sealed container, within 1 hour of cooking. Treat it like cooked meat, 3-4 days in the fridge should be fine. When you cook it, stir fry it on a high temperature until it's thoroughly cooked through. Source(s): http://www.foodsafety.gov/poisoning/caus..
