Authorship of the books seems to be disputed. Lal Kitab is a popular astrology system with stress on Karmic debts and planetary placements. While Lal Kitab is based on Vedic Jyotish it has enough differences to make it a separate system from Vedic Jyotish. Lal Kitab is a mystery in itself. It is written in ancient Urdu without the element of punctuation and sounds Greek to a layman. Poetical verses interpolated with philosophy and hidden nuances of destiny form the core 'farmaans' of the book. Lal Kitab is a remarkable branch of Vedic astrology. It is believed that the father of Modern Lal Kitab is astrologer Pt. Rupchand Joshi. However, he has attributed this wisdom to a supernatural divine being that used him as a medium to help humanity.
