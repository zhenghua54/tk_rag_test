I would be wary of any diagnosis of leaky gut syndrome if you don't have inflammatory bowel conditions (Crohn's disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or asthma. The leaky gut treatment I recommend involves avoiding alcohol and NSAIDS as well as any foods that you're allergic to.
