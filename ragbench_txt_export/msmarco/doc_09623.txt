Abdominal Cramps. Some women experience cramps early in pregnancy. This is usually due to the fertilized egg, or embryo, implanting into the uterus. Implantation occurs 8 to 10 days after ovulation, which is 4 to 6 days before a missed period would occur. But some women experience pregnancy symptoms days before their period is due. As a result of the shift in hormones, tiny changes take place in the body that alert the woman that she may be pregnant even before a positive pregnancy test.
