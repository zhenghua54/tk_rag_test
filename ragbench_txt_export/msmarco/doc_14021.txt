So for example if the electrolyte is a concentrated solution of sodium chloride, hydrogen gas is formed at the cathode because hydrogen is less reactive than sodium. And chlorine gas is formed at the anode because the solution is concentrated. Ions present in the electrolyte are H + and OH-from water and Cu +2 and SO 4 - from copper(ii) sulfate. At the Cathode: 4OH - - 4e - â†’ O 2 + 2H 2 O. Oxygen from OH-ions is formed. Bubbles of colorless gas are formed. To test for oxygen, approach a glowing splint, if positive it relights.
