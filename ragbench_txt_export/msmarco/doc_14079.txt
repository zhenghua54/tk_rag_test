2 Reviews. Lysine is an essential amino acid. Essential means that it is not produced by the body and therefore it must be taken in either by diet or by taking supplements. Lysine is found in foods such as lentils, red meat, pork, poultry, cod fish, sardines, nuts, eggs, soy beans, brewer's yeast, and dairy products.
