The Schlieffen Plan. Germany had been preparing for war long before 1914. In fact, Germany had started drawing up a plan for war-the Schlieffen Plan-in 1897. It took nine years to finalise, but it was based on the theory that Germany would be at war with France and Russia at the same time. It did not prepare for many of the events that occured in July and August 1914.
