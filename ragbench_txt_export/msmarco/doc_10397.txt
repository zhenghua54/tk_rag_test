The placenta is the container that keeps the baby isolated from the mother. The fetal blood flows through the baby, out the umbilical cord to the placenta and no further. The placental membrane separates maternal blood from fetal blood. Oxygen and nutrients in the maternal blood in the intervillous spaces diffuse through the walls of the villi and enter the fetal capillaries.
