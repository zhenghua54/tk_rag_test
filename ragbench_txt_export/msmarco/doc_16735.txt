Hormones can have three major types of action: autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine. Autocrine refers to chemicals released from a cell that have an action on that same cell (like negative feedback, where a cell releases a chemical that hits receptors on the same cell, and stops further release of the chemical). Oxytocin is one of the two major hormones which are secreted from an area of the brain called the posterior pituitary (the other one is called vasopressin, and is involved in water regulation, though it also has been known to curl the toes of male voles).
