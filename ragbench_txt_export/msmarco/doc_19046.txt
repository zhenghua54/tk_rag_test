Guide. Thyroid hormone tests are blood tests that check how well the thyroid gland is working. The thyroid gland makes hormones that regulate the way the body uses energy. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland that lies in front of your windpipe (trachea), just below your voice box (larynx). Thyroid hormone tests are done to: 1  Find out what is causing an abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test. 2  Check how well treatment of thyroid disease is working. 3  Screen newborns to find out if the thyroid gland function is normal.
