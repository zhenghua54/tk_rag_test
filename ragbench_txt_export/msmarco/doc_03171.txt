The plumbing company I work for will never use plastic pipes for potable (drinking) water. We use them only for waste water disposal. Don't drink water from PVC pipe as chemicals can be leached from the glue used to join the pipes into the water. If in doubt, call your town/city building inspector and ask. They can tell you if it is up to code for your area
