Aspartame can be found in thousands of processed foods and drinks. Products that contain aspartame include yogurt, frozen desserts, pudding, dry dessert mixes, chewing gum, and soft drinks. It is also used as a tabletop sweetener (for example, to sweeten a glass of iced tea). It is a combination of 2 amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar. Aspartame provides sweetness and enhances the flavor of food without adding as many calories as sugar. Unlike sugar, it does not contribute to tooth decay. It also does not raise blood sugar levels.
