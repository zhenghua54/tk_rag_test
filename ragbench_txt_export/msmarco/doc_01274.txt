The way I know if someone is in love is when they are always talking about that person, they are always daydreaming, and they are always distracted in the work that they are doing. When someone is in love they do not care what other people say, they just follow their heart and go as far as their heart takes them. When you know that someone is in love, is when they day dream. They also drop there grades because they pay more attention to some one else in stead of there work. They also stare at the person they like. Or sometimes they miss a lesson for going to sleep during class.
