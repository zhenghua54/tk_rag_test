As the definition a module consists a single block of code that can be invoked in the way that a procedure, function, or method is invoked, the definition seems very vague and broad. So could anyone explain it in other clear words and show some actual example how to break a requirement into module. Thanks. A module, 1  encapsulates code and data to implement a particular functionality. 2  has an interface that lets clients to access its functionality in an uniform manner. 3  is easily pluggable with another module that expects its interface.
