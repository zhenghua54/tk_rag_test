The average cost of a vacation to a Disney resort in Florida of course depends on how many will be going in total. At present, the average cost per person is $250 for ages 10 â€¦ and above, and $230 for ages 3 to 9. This is for a 5-day pass and of course the flights will be extra depending on which country you live in.
