Criminal History. All FBI background checks include a summary of your criminal history. The FBI compiles criminal history, sometimes called a rap sheet, through information gathered from fingerprint matches obtained through federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Any company can require a background check as a condition of employment. However, only you can request a copy of your criminal history summary from the FBI. You will be notified whether or not you have a criminal history.
