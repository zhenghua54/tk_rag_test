The cost of vaccinations is between $50 and $100. The cat should also get some flea treatment or preventive solutions, which may cost from $50 to $150. Heartworm prevention is recommended, and may cost up to $40. The cat should also be checked out by a vet, to make sure there are no problems; the vet bills may be between $50 (for a simple check up) to $300 for advanced tests, if these are needed.
