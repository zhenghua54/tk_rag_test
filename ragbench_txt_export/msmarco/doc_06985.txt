Your disability benefits are based on how much other income you earn. As your income increases, your monthly benefit amount is generally reduced. Your income is considered on a monthly basis so that your disability benefit can change each month and even be eliminated if your income that month is too high. You then divide this amount in half to get $407.50. This is the amount that your disability benefit will be reduced that month. If you are generally earning more than $700 a month or $8,400 a year, you will be earning too much to be eligible for benefits.
