Glass fiber when used as a thermal insulating material, is specially manufactured with a bonding agent to trap many small air cells, resulting in the characteristically air-filled low-density glass wool family of products. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass (A for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A new type, E-glass, was formed; this is an alumino-borosilicate glass that is alkali This was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation.
