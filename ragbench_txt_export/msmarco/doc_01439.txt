The police can also stop and search you or your vehicle if they reasonably suspect you of terrorist activity. They can't stop and search you just for being in a particular area, unless they reasonably suspect you of terrorist activity. A police officer can search someone in the street if the person consents to the search. The police officer should always make it clear that consent is being asked for. Unless you agree, the search should not take place.
