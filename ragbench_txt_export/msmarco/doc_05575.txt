Until now, researchers' knowledge of the types of trees in the Amazon and where they were located was based on analyses of regions â€” the rain forest's vast expanse made it challenging to survey in its entirety. For instance, scientists didn't even know the most common tree species in the Amazon. 'Hyperdominant' trees. Of these 16,000 tree species, scientists unexpectedly discovered that only 227 species, or 1.4 percent of all the types of trees in Amazonia, made up half of the nearly 400 billion total trees estimated to live there.
