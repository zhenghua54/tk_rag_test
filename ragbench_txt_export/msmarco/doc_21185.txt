SP-A is a 34–36 kDa protein that facilitates the surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant phospholipids in the alveolus, regulates surfactant phospholipid synthesis, secretion, and recycling, and counteracts the inhibitory effects of plasma proteins released during lung injury on surfactant function (2) ⇓ . Surfactant protein A has been shown to regulate the homeostasis of surfactant phospholipids, facilitate the lowering of surface tension in the alveolus, and prevent the inhibition of surfactant function by plasma proteins.
