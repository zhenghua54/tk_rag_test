For those seeking federal pardons, the application process will often take at least 18 months to two years because the Office of the Pardon Attorney will typically do a full background check and investigation when a person requests a pardon, and this investigation takes between 18 months and two years to complete. Depending on the type of crime and the length of the sentence, it is usually wise for a prisoner to serve a significant part of their sentence (i.e., 30-50% of their total time) before filing for a commutation.
