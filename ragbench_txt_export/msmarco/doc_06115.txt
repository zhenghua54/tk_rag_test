The weed has already disbursed seeds for next year and will die out on its own without the use of herbicides. Seeds will then lie dormant until the cooler weather of fall arrives and then they will start to germinate and will grow throughout the winter. Chickweed may be controlled in two ways. Itâ€™s too late this year to go with pre-emergent herbicides. Chickweed and other winter annuals are already up and growing. Post-emergent herbicides should be applied after the weed is up and actively growing. The target application time should be from October to early March.
