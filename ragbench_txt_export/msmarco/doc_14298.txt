A rough way to estimate the monthly PMI cost for 30-year conventional loans is to divide the loan amount by 900, 1300, 1900, or 3200 for loans with down payments of 3%, 5%, 10%, or 15% respectively. For example, let's say you buy a $200,000 home and put 5% down. Your down payment is $10,000 and the morgtage is $190,000. Divide the $190,000 mortgage by 1500 and you get your monthly PMI cost, $127. PMI doesn't change as the outstanding balance changes.
