HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization. While this type of insurance is generally much more affordable, there are more restrictions than a PPO plan. The network of available health care providers may be smaller and you will need to select a Primary Physician. An individual health insurance policy is a policy that you purchase on your own, with only one person (yourself) as the covered policy holder. There are many different types of policies for individual health insurance, such as PPO, HMO and short-term health insurance.
