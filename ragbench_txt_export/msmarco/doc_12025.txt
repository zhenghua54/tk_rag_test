General Count von Schlieffen (1833 – 1913) was Chief of the German General Staff from 1891 until he retired in 1905. As a testament to his work for Germany, he finished an operational plan with which Germany could successfully attack France. (1) That the war would have to be fought against France and Russia, probably supported by Britain. (2) That the decisive theatre of war would remain in France, but that Germany must stay on the defensive with Russia. (3) That in the case of France’s swift defeat, her allies would offer little resistance.
