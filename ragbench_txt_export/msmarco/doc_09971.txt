106 billion years. The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is called the age equation and is: Dating rocks by these radioactive timekeepers is simple in theory, but the laboratory procedures are complex. Most sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, limestone, and shale are related to the radiometric time scale by bracketing them within time zones that are determined by dating appropriately selected igneous rocks, as shown by a hypothetical example.
