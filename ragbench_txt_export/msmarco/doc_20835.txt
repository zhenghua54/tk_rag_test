Word of Mouth. Pin it. For years I assumed that stock and broth were interchangeable terms for the same thing: liquid flavored with vegetables, meat scraps, and bones used as the base for soups, sauces, and other dishes. Meat gives flavor, which is why it is necessary in a broth that can be eaten alone. Bones, cartilage, and skin have collagen, which when heated, turns into gelatin that gives a stock body and a thicker, richer texture in the mouth.
