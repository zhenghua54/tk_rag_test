As many of you may already know, I've got two Burmese Pythons, an 8-ft long male and a 10 1/2-ft long female. They are both almost 3-yrs old. I successfully bred them this year and the female became pregnant (Officially referred to as: gravid.). Some snakes bear live young and some lay eggs; Burmese Pythons lay eggs. Mine laid her eggs today and I thought some of you might like to see some of the photos I took. These first three photos were taken last Saturday, April 14, before she laid her eggs.
