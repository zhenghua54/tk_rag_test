Essentially, the invoice price is the amount of money that the dealership pays the manufacturer for a car. For example, a car with a $25,000 MSRP might have an invoice price of around $23,000, meaning that the dealer likely owns the car for $23,000. That means the dealer has a profit margin of around $2,000. Given that the invoice price is the dealership's cost on the car, you can't always find a dealer that's willing to sell the car for less than that. It is possible, though, because there are other ways that a dealership makes money from the sale of a given car
