“Powdered cellulose is made by cooking raw plant fiber—usually wood—in various chemicals to separate the cellulose,” says the Wall Street Journal, and it’s even used in organic products. Considered safe for human consumption by the FDA, many companies tout powdered cellulose’s benefits as a source of fiber. Though it is technically a fiber source, it mainly acts as a filler, provides better structure, and strengthens food to stand up to shipping. If you answered a resounding “No” to this question, think again. Powdered cellulose (aka processed virgin wood pulp), is a binder and filler used in all types of foods, especially high-fiber and reduced-fat products.
