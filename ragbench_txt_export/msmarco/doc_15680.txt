I accepted an offer on my house this Monday. The couple who are buying it are not in a chain and neither am I. I wanted to know if I would be in my new house before christmas. My solictior has said it will probably take only 6 weeks. Report Abuse. it normally takes 3 months but it all depends on how good your agents and solicitors are my mother in law has bought a house last month but that was meant to have been no chain and quick move but now there completion is end of January.
