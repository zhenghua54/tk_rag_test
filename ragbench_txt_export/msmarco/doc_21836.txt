Since its edges do not curl, garter stitch is often used for borders. Before you begin the scarf, follow our basic knitting instructions to knit a gauge swatch in stockinette stitch using size-9 needles and Aran-weight yarn. 4 stitches and 6 rows equal 1 inch. Finished size of scarf: 8 by 60 inches. For this craft we use the abbreviations: k (knit), p (purl), sts (stitches). Work the 6 rows of the pattern stitch. Repeat rows 9 and 10 until scarf measures 56 inches from the cast-on row. End after working a row 9. Work the 6 rows of the pattern stitch. Repeat Rows 9 and 10 until the scarf is 59 inches. Knit next 8 rows. Cast off. Weave in yarn ends.
