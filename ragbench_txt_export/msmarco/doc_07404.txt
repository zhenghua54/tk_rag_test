Report Abuse. I do not believe that a colonoscopy is an operation! Had one done about 4 years back and it did not take long but you are in recovery for a while because they put you under to do the scope. MyKidsMom Â· 8 years ago. Thumbs up. It's a little camera that allows the doctor to exam the entire length of the colon. If during the procedure he spots a polyp he will remove it for further study. The entire process is about 30 minutes or less.
