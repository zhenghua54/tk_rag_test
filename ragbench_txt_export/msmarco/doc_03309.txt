A: Albuterol (Ventolin, Proair, Proventil) is a bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways and increases air flow to the lungs. Albuterol is used to treat or prevent bronchospasm in people with reversible obstructive airway disease. Albuterol is also used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.
