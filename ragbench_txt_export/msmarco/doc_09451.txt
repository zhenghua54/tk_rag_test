New Zealand Colonisation. Though a Dutchman was the first European to sight the country, it was the British who colonised New Zealand. With growing numbers of British migrants, and a dwindling and largely landless Maori population, British culture dominated New Zealand life throughout the 19 th and first half of the 20 th centuries. However, since World War II, New Zealand has moved towards its own unique national identity and place in the world.
