A recessive trait is the phenotype that is seen only when a homozygous recessive genotype for the trait of interest is present. This means that an individual must have two recessive alleles for the gene that determines this trait of interest. Remember, individuals must have two alleles for a gene, so someone could be homozygous dominant (EE), homozygous recessive (ee), or heterozygous (Ee). In this example, the recessive trait is having attached earlobes and is only seen in someone with the genotype ee (homozygous recessive).
