The Eurocircuits eC-reflow-mate is a batch oven with quartz infra-red heaters on the top and bottom plus convection (controlled air flow). The oven has two floating temperature sensors (top and bottom) and a provision for one sensor to clamp/attach onto the PCB (the “external” sensor). In some reflow ovens, the PCBs are snapped in a frame that touches the PCB only on the edges. The purpose of the frame is to minimize the contact area between the PCB and the oven, to avoid heat from the PCB to flow away. Other reflow ovens have a grid plate onto which you place the PCBs.
