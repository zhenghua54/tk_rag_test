Good dietary sources of vitamin D -- eggs, as well as fortified milk and cereal -- while common in young people's diets, are often missing in elderly people's diets. Such foods as milk, the major source of vitamin D in food, and most breakfast cereals, contain vitamin D as an additive. These additions, which help prevent rickets (a vitamin D deficiency disease) in children, are synthetic.
