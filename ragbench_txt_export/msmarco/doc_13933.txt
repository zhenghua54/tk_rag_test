Nitrobenzene is produced commercially by the exothermic nitration of benzene with fuming nitric acid in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst. The crude nitrobenzene is passed through washer-separators to remove residual acid and is then distilled to remove benzene, water, dinitrobenzene and trinitrobenzene.
