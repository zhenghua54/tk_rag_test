What does an Uber driver really earn? Last week, the taxi cab startup, which is currently valued at $18.2 billion, offered one answer to that question, claiming an Uber driver could earn $90,000 a year working in New York City, and $70,000 in San Francisco. Not a bad take—but also not $90,000. It’s also not a hugely different hourly rate compared to the smart driver, who mostly just works more hours. In short, it seems like very few full-time Uber drivers are earning above $30 per hour.
