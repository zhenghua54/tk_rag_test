This career is growing because more people will need physical therapy as the U.S. population ages. And health insurance companies are covering these services more often, so more patients are using them. Also, PT assistants are doing more of the work that physical therapists used to do. Thatâ€™s because this is a good way to keep the cost of treatment down -- after all, PT assistants earn less than physical therapists.
