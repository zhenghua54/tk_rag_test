How to make Moringa Tea. Moringa oleifera is one of the most rich sources of nutrients and vitamins that our body needs. It is rich in calcium, potassium, beta-carotene, Vitamin C, and iron. Moringa can be prepared as a vegetable or included in soups, but mostly just the leaves and fruits are used. To make Moringa tea you should harvest fresh leaves from your tree and dry them at room temperature. Place the leaves in a brown paper bag with some holes in it and hang the bag in a cool area of your home. In about 10-14 days your leaves should be dry enough to use. To make the tea, shred or pulverize the leaves.
