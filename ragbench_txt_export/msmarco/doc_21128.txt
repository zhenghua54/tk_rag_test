The IMRC position sensor is located on the valve shaft of the IMRC and allows the PCM to know what exact position the IMRC is at. This valve position sensor also has an armature that moves the IMRC valve and provides the PCM with a linear position signal that lets the PCM know the position when moving. The Intake Manifold Runner Control (IMRC_ system found in the Honda / Acura K series engines has to do with the intake manifold and the butterfly actuated runner system thatâ€™s been used so often in small displacement motors.
