Under the state housing codes, ***from October 1 to May 1***, the landlord must provide enough heat so that the temperature in the apartment is at least 68 degrees from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the temperature in the apartment must be at least 65 degrees. Can the landlord turn off the heat in your apartment? It is summer but it has been low 50's at night were I live and has gotten very cold.
