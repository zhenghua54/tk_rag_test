It is also important to understand that the term “organic” has many connotations associated with it, such as sustainability and biodiversity. It is an understatement to say that being certified organic has turned into a huge bureaucratic process. While the certification process does force organic farms to keep good records, it does not prevent the use of non-organic substances on organic products.
