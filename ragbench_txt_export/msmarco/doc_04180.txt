Geodes can also form in sedimentary rocks such as limestone or sandstone. The cavity in these rocks is usually formed from a solid core. A mass of minerals, or nodule, in the sediment may begin to dissolve and leave space behind. In other cases, organic matter such as coral, a fossil, or a piece of wood buried in the sediment weathers out over time. Cavities are most common in igneous rock created by cooling lava or magma. Usually this happens when a bubble of carbon dioxide and water vapor forms in flows of lava, “much like bubbles in carbonated beverages,” says George Harlow, an expert in minerals and crystals at the American Museum of Natural History.
