The average starting salary for master's degree graduates can vary greatly based off of several factors, including the type of degree earned. For example, a computer science program graduate typically earns more than someone who graduates from a sociology program, even though they both hold a master's degree. The earnings for humanities program graduates were similar, regardless of field. Graduates of special education master's degree programs earned the highest average starting salaries among students completing education programs.
