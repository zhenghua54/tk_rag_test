The major nerves and vessels to the orbit and globe enter through 3 openings. The superior orbital fissure is bounded by the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid. The greater wing of the sphenoid, the maxilla, and the palatine bones of the orbit form the boundaries of the inferior orbital fissure. The optic canal is at the apex of the orbit and lies within the sphenoid bone. The orbital plate of the maxilla joins the orbital plate of the zygoma and the orbital plate of the palatine bones to form the floor. Medially, the orbital wall consists of the frontal process of the maxilla, the lacrimal bone, the sphenoid, and the thin lamina papyracea of the ethmoid.
