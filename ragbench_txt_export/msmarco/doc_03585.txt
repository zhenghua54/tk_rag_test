1 In 1860, German inventor Nikolaus Otto uses ethyl alcohol as a fuel in an early internal combustion engine. 2  In 1862 and 1864, a tax on alcohol was passed in the U.S. to pay for the Civil War, increasing the price of ethanol to over $2.00 per gallon. 1 Ethanol production rises to the 4-billion-US-gallon (15,000,000 m 3) level. 2  Between 1997 and 2002, three million U.S. cars and light trucks are produced which could run on E85, a blend of 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline.
