The word “coccus” has a couple of different meanings in biology, but it most commonly refers to a type of bacteria that is spherical or slightly oval in shape. In this application, the plural term used to describe entire bacterial chains or infections is cocci, whereas a single coccus bacterium is called a monococcus. Coccus bacteria cause a number of common infections, including strep throat. Cocci are usually shaped like flat, elongated ovals. Many species of Neisseria are found in healthy human throats, but the bacteria that cause meningitis also belong to this genus.
