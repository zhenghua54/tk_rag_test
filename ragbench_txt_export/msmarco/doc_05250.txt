In a popular and less technical sense, the term cognate also is used to refer to words in two languages that are similar but have no common origin, such as the Spanish sopa (meaning soup) and the English soap.. An example of such a change is the English word arena, which usually refers to a sports facility, and the Spanish arena, which usually means sand.. They both come from the Latin harena, which originally meant sand and came in time to also refer to an area of a Roman amphitheater that was covered with sand.
