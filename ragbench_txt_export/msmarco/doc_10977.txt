Its cell body lies within the brainstem or the spinal cord. A preganglionic axon extends from this cell body and exits the CNS in either a cranial nerve or spinal nerve. It projects to the cell body of the second neuron, which is houses within an autonomic ganglion in the peripheral nervous system. The second neuron in this pathway is called a ganglionic neuron, and a postganglionic axon extends from its cell body to effector cells or an effector organ. Many visceral effectors have dual innervation, meaning that they are innervated by postganglionic axons from both ANS divisions. The actions of the divisions usually oppose each other, and so they are said to exert antagonistic effects on the same organ.
