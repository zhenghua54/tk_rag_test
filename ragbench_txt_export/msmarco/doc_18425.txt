(b) 4.0 atm SO2, 2.0 atm O2, 10 atm SO3. (c) each reactant and product at a partial pressure of 1.0 atm. You need to use the following equation: delta G = delta G o + RT ln Q. where R is the Universal gas constant (8.31 J/molK), T is temp in Kelvin, and Q is the reaction quotient. An additional note for c. When the partial pressures are all equal to 1, Q = 1, and ln 1 = 0. Therefore, delta G = delta G o. This is not suprising because the standard delta G (delta G o)is by definition when the pressures are all equal to 1.
