Symptoms of MERS Virus Infection. A new aggressive pathogen has recently been identified; it's a coronavirus that causes symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath that may become severe or deadly. The disease is termed MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS-CoV). 1 The infection appears to be the result of spread of the virus from camels to humans, resulting in limited person-to-person spread but not sustained transmission in humans. 2  MERS-CoV is a type of coronavirus, similar to the one that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or the common cold.
