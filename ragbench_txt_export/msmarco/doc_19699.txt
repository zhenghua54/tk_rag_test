Insurance carriers rely on claims representatives to investigate and evaluate property damage claims. The process involves local or long-distance travel to damage sites. For instance, a property claims representative may meet a claimant at her place of employment to investigate minor vehicle damage. It is the job of the representative to make contact with claimants and schedule a time to inspect the property damage. Communicating with customers throughout the claims process is a routine aspect of a property claims representative's job.
