Federal regulations require each school to develop an estimated cost of attendance. This figure is used in determining the amount of Federal aid a student is eligible for. At Chapman University Fowler School of Law, tuition is determined by the Board of Trustees and the Finance Committee. The cost of living allowance is based on student surveys, institutional costs, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and U.S. Department of Education guidelines. Aid is considered to be loans, grants, work assistance, fellowships, or scholarships. Students costs may vary and an increase in a student's Cost of Attendance (Budget) may be possible for special circumstances.
