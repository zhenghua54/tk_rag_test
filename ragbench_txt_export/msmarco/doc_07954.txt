Parachutes can be guided by letting some of the air spill out of the front or back of the parachute. There is also a hole in the middle to allow the parachute to fall vertically. Parachutes can be circular, the traditional shape, or rectangular the shape used for some military and stunt use. The first parachute was designed in 1514 by Leonardo da Vinci in Italy, but it was never used. The first man to make and use one was the Frenchman Andre Garnerin who jumped from a balloon over Paris in 1797.
