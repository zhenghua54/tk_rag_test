Researchers have identified mutations in the SNCA gene that may lead to a loss of intellectual functions (dementia). Two mutations cause a particular disorder known as dementia with Lewy bodies, in which dementia is associated with deposits of Lewy bodies in certain areas of the brain. Several common variations in the SNCA gene have been found to increase the risk of multiple system atrophy, a progressive brain disorder that affects movement and balance and disrupts the function of the autonomic nervous system.
