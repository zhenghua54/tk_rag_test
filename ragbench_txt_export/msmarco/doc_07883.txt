Knowing this, you can be fairly certain a gobbler with a beard of less than 5 is a one year old bird.There are still exceptions to this though since mature gobblers can lose most or all of the beard to various causes. 1 Swampy area birds (Osceola) generally have longer beards and spurs than rocky area birds (Merriam's). 2  Leg Length -- If the legs are longer (like on an Osceola) the beard will grow longer before it starts to wear at the end.
