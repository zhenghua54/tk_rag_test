Parasympathetic preganglionic axons (blue line) emerge from the sacral region of the cord to form the. . These neurons penetrate pelvic organs to synapse with intramural ganglia light blue circle. From here, postganglionic axons (dashed blue line) synapse with their receptors within the organ. These ganglia (large yellow circles) are named the. . They sit just ventral to the aorta and the nerves entering and leaving them are intertwined forming a plexus. This entire region is called the 'solar plexus'.
