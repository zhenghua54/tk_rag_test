Kitten or Puppy: Birth to 1 Year. You'll need to bring your kitten or puppy in for vaccines every 3 to 4 weeks until he's 16 weeks old. Dogs will get distemper-parvo and rabies boosters, and may also be vaccinated against health woes such as kennel cough. Your cat or dog will get vaccines when needed and will get a thorough physical, along with tests to follow up on any problems. Blood and urine tests can give your vet the scoop on your pet's kidney health, thyroid hormone levels, and more.
