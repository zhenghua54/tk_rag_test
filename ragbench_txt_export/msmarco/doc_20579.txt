Cyrus McCormick, engraving by George Smillie. Library of Congress. Cyrus McCormick (1809-1884) was a Chicago industrialist who in 1831 invented the first commercially successful mechanical reaper, a horse-drawn machine to harvest wheat. Meanwhile, Cyrus McCormick had moved to Chicago, built a factory in 1847, begun the mass manufacture of his reaper, and founded what eventually became the International Harvester Company. In 1872 he produced a reaper which automatically bound the bundles with wire.
