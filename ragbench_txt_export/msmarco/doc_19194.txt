In our tidal marshes, which occupy approximately 18% of our 451 miles of shoreline, the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora is the most abundant plant. It is adapted to a limited tidal range. Spartina grows rapidly in full sunlight and forms the base of what biologists call a detritus-based food chain. They can smell bad because of the release of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg gas). They often breed undesirable organisms like mosquitoes. They consume prime waterfront real estate. They release greenhouse gasses like methane and nitrous oxide.
