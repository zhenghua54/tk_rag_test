This is because pseudoephedrine is a precursor molecule and can be chemically changed to methamphetamine. It is the immediate precursor, and in fact, methamphetamine is pseudoephedrine with one molecule chemically removed. Another example is insulin. It is proinsulin until it is released in the blood. Then an enzyme helps break a sulfide bond in the molecule to allow it to form its effective structure as insulin.
