The venom from a single bite of an Inland Taipan can kill as many as 100 people. That may seem like nothing compared to the Belcher’s Sea Snake, but it’s still pretty impressive! While the rattlesnake is the most dangerous snake in the Americas, this snake is ten times more venomous. The rattlesnake is actually a type of viper, and is quite venomous. The most dangerous snakes in this species are the young Eastern Diamondbacks. When treated promptly, fewer than 4% of rattlesnake bites are fatal, but when left untreated, all bites are potentially lethal.
