Diatoms are algae with distinctive, transparent cell walls made of silicon dioxide hydrated with a small amount of water (Si02 + H20). Silica is the main component of glass and hydrated silica is very like the mineral opal, making these algae, often called algae in glass houses more like algae in opal houses. Diatoms have been placed in the division Bacilliariophyta, which is distinguished by the presence of an inorganic cell wall composed of hydrated silica. There are an estimated 20,000 to 2 million species of diatom on Earth.
