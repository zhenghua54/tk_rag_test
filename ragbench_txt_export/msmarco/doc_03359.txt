Setting Limits. The American Heart Association recommends limiting your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. And this may be easier said than done, due to the amount of sodium found in processed and canned foods. Frozen foods can even contain high amounts of sodium in an effort to keep them fresh longer. Sodium plays a huge role in leading a healthy, sensible lifestyle. If you do not consume enough sodium in your diet on a daily basis, your body cannot maintain healthy fluid levels, and it may have a negative impact on the way your muscles expand and contract, especially during exercise.
