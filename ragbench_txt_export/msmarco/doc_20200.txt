Range of motion is the measurement of movement around a joint. Passive range of motion requires full assistance for an individual to move their joint. Active-assistive requires partial assistance, and active range of motion is when the client is able to move their joint independently. There are three primary types of exercises specific to range of motion. Passive range of motion is typically practiced on a joint that is inactive. The physical therapist may use this exercise on a client who is paralyzed or unable to mobilize a specific joint.
