Final Thoughts. If you plan on playing a lot of poker, Club WPT is a fantastic deal. As this review points out, this service is definitely not a scam. For $19.95 a month, you get access to. 1  Daily $1,000 prize pool tournaments. 2  Monthly $10,000 prize pool tournaments. The first thing that caught my attention with Club WPT was the daily $1,000 pool-prize tournament. For $19.95 a month, you can compete in a tournament that will give away $1,000 split between people who make the money.
