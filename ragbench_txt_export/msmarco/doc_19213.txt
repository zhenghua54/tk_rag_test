Blood Group Incompatibility (Rh or ABO problems). If a baby and mother have different blood types, sometimes the mother produces antibodies that destroy the newborn's red blood cells. This causes a sudden buildup of bilirubin in the baby's blood. This type of jaundice usually begins during the first 24 hours of life. Rh problems are now preventable with an injection of RhoGAM to the mother within 72 hours after delivery. This prevents her from forming antibodies that might endanger subsequent babies. Breastfeeding Jaundice. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs in 5% to 10% of newborns. It's caused by insufficient intake of breast milk (calories and fluid). It follows the same pattern as physiological jaundice.
