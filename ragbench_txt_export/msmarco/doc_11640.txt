Some of the larger temperate rainforests are on the northwest coast of North America, southeastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and the southwest coast of South America. Within rainforests, there are four different layers with various plants that have adapted to life in that layer. The majority are found in Central and South America, but tropical rainforests also exist in Southeast Asia, eastern Australia, and central Africa (map of locations) . The largest in tact tropical rainforest in the world is in the Amazon River Basin. Tropical rainforests form in these locations because they are within the ITCZ, which provides the warm temperatures common in the forests. Due to the temperatures and plant growth, transpiration rates are high
