Best Answer: The nephron's cup shaped Bowmans Capsule surrounds a knot of blood capillaries called the glomerulus. Much of the bloods fluid filters into the glomerulus due to pressure from the circulatory system. Left behind are large proteins and whole cells, which are too large to fit through. The distal convoluted tubule, urine is then passed through here to the collecting duct where it is concentrated due to its permeability to water. It leaves the collecting duct into the pelvis of the kidney, which leads to the ureter and the bladder where it is stored.
