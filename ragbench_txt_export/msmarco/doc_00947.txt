Grass is a vascular plant because it has vascular tissue that carries food, water, and nutrients, it has a true root system, and it's made of long, tube-like cells. Phloem tissue carries sugar from the leaves to other cells of the plants. Non vascular plants are plants that lack tissues that transport water, nutrients, and sugar. Some example of non vascular plants are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
