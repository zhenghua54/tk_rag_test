Some mortgage providers require home insurance policies to issue a loan to purchase property. HomeInsurance.com reports that the average annual cost for a home policy is $724.84 for a married couple. Policy premium costs vary widely based on geographic location, property size and desired coverage. A couple who owns a home in a state often hit by hurricanes, for example, might pay a higher premium rate.
