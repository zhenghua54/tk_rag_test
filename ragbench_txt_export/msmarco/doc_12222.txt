Remember, contributions can be withdrawn at any time. If you withdraw Roth earnings for educational purposes, make sure the account has been open with money in it for at least five years. You will be taxed on the earnings withdrawal, but not assessed a penalty. As an example, consider an example with a father named Dan.
