The lancelets (from lancet) — also known as amphioxi (singular, amphioxus) — comprise some 32 species of fish-like marine chordates in the order Amphioxiformes, with a global distribution in shallow temperate (as far north as Scotland) and tropical seas, usually found half-buried in sand. Lancelets are typically 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, or 7 centimetres (2.8 in) at the longest. They have a translucent, somewhat fish-like body, but without any paired fins or other limbs. A relatively poorly developed tail fin is present, so they are not especially good swimmers.
