For instance, the optimum soil temperature for seed germination of vegetable crops such as cucumber, cantaloupe, okra, pumpkin, squash and watermelon is 95 degrees F, but the heat of summer will decrease yields and plant vigor. Soil temperatures at which vegetable seed will grow are classified into four categories-the minimum temperature required for seed growth, an optimum temperature, a realistic soil temperature and, maximized temperature above which little germination will occur.
