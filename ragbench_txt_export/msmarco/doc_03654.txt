It is in the group of medications called histamine blockers that work by blocking histamine in the stomach, which decreases the amount of acid produced, and relieves your symptoms. Pepcid belongs to a class of drug called histamine-2 or H2 blockers, which work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Marathon Pharmaceuticals approval to market prescription Pepcid in 1986.
