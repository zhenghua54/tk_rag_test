The Thymus. The thymus is located in the upper part of the chest. It is made of two lobes that join in front of the trachea. The thymus is an important part of children's immune systems. It grows larger until puberty and then begins to shrink. After the white blood cells mature, they leave the thymus gland and get settled in the spleen and the lymph nodes, where a fresh batch of T cells is produced. These white blood cells are the body's immune system and protect the body by producing antibodies that stop the invasion of foreign agents, bacteria and viruses.
