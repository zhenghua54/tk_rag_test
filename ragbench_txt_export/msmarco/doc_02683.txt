All of the fabric/cleaning info sewn into the pants was in German, so I had to google. It turns out that cupro is a fancy “silk substitute” like rayon and tencel are designed to be. It is made from wood fiber and cotton by-products. (I thought I was holding silk, at first, but I recognize the word for silk in most languages, so then I was fearful about cleaning issues). No worries.
