Ionic compounds form between a metal (cation) and a non-metal (anion), or between a metal (cation) and a polyatomic ion. If your compound contains a metal it's ionic. This is definitely one of those topics where mastery comes with practice. The rules seem deceptively simple, and as you read through the rules for each group of compounds naming itself may seem initially simple. 1 Name the metal CATION first, then the non-metal ANION. 2  The metal keeps its name as listed in the Periodic Table. 3  Add a roman numeral (I, II, III, etc.) to indicate the CHARGE on the CATION. 4  The rules for the anion part of the name remain the same. 5  Change an anion's ending to-ide if it's a binary compound.
