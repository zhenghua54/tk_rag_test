When a project is behind schedule, not everything is lost and there are many steps you can take to fix things. You need to know what to do when a project is behind schedule but first you need to identify the reason(s) why a project is behind schedule. If you don't identify correctly why the project is behind schedule, then the steps you take to get back on track might be the wrong ones and the result could be really devastating. In a sense, if the patient has gastritis, you don't give him an aspirin because this will only make his situation worse.
