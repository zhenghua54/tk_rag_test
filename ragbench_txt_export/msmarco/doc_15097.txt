Volcanic neck. Definition: a hill resulting from differential weathering and erosion between the former feeder tube of a volcano and its surrounding rocks. A volcanic plug, also called a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic landform created when lava hardens within a vent on an active volcano. When forming, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption
