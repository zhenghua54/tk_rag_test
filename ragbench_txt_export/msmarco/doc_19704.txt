Insurance claims adjusters come with different titles, such as claims specialist, claims representative, or independent claims analyst, but they all do the same job. The result is that while an adjuster will know more than you about the claims business in general, he or she will not know your particular claim nearly as well as you do. You were there during the accident. You know what your injuries are, how much and where they hurt, and how long they have taken to heal.
