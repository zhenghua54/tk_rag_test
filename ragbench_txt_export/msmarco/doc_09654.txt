Parkinson’s disease is most often diagnosed in patients in their 60s, with 1-to-2 percent of the population over the age of 65 having Parkinson’s disease. However, Parkinson’s disease can also be diagnosed in patients who are under the age of 50, in which case it is referred to as young-onset Parkinson’s disease. An estimated 15-25 percent of people with Parkinson's disease have a known relative with the disease. In rare cases, parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20. This condition is called juvenile parkinsonism.
