On the bottom of the ocean around deep-sea hydrothermal vents, there is a profusion of life that thrives on the hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gas released from the vents. Some of the most impressive of the creatures that live here are the giant tube-worms. Deep Sea Hydrothermal Vents. Throughout the oceans of the world there exist undersea mountain ranges, which have formed as result of volcanic activity. These are formally known as rift zones – where the movement of tectonic plates is tearing the earth’s crust apart.
