Fabric that is woven tightly tends to be more durable than fabric with a loose weave. Materials with looser weaves have threads that can be pulled easily. As with linens, the thread count in sofa upholstery determines the quality of the fabric. A higher thread count translates to better quality fabric. Buying the right material sofa depends on a few factors, including the sofaâ€™s use, whether one has small children and pets, and where the sofa will be placed. Everyday sofas need more durable upholstery, and pets and small children place added strain on fabrics.
