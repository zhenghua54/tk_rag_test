That's the color of an alligator in the popular imagination. The mascot for the University of Florida is green and the emblem on a Lacoste shirt is green. The only problem, Yon points out, is that alligators are not green. Alligators are black with pale underbellies. When they're dry, the top of their hides sometimes looks gray.
