The perikaryon, or body of the neuron, is rich in organelles (Fig. 1-4). It often stands out poorly from a homogeneous background neuropil, most of which is composed of nonmyelinated axons and dendrites, synaptic complexes and glial cell processes. However, this picture does not hold true for many neurons. The neuron is the most polymorphic cell in the body and defies formal classification on the basis of shape, location, function, fine structure or transmitter substance.
