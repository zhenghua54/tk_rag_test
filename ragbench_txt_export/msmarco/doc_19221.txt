Lipids are a glycerol molecule which has three alcohol/hydroxide groups on it, this makes it able to form three ester bonds with three carboxylic acid/fatty acid molecules, this is the basic structure of a fat/lipid molecule. It also makes them useful for enzymes, because without enzymes you wouldn't be reading this text, and I would never have written it, they make chemical reactions possible at temperatures that in the lab simply are not possible. There is a lot of info on the internet about proteins you should have a look.
