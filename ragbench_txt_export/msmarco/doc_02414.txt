TGI Fridays/Associated Press. TGI Fridays just announced a deal for endless appetizers.. The unlimited appetizer deal for just $10 is a first for a major restaurant chain, according to USA Today. But the bargain comes with a big caveat: you can only get refills of the same appetizer, such as potato skins, mozzarella sticks, or Tuscan Spinach Dip.
