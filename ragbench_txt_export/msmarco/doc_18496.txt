That depends on the number of children, the cost of care, and your income. You can count up to $3,000 in child-care expenses for one child, or up to $6,000 for two or more children. The credit is a percentage of the amount spent on child care, and that percentage gradually decreases as income increases. The cost of day care, preschool, before-and after-school care, day camp, or a nanny or other babysitter can count toward the credit.
