Symptoms of leukemia can be easy to overlook because they can mimic symptoms of the flu or a bad cold. To tell the difference, ask the person in your care about any possible bone pain or tenderness, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, loss of appetite or weight, and abdominal pain from an enlarged spleen. Like the blobby looking cells in this photo, the leukemia cells eventually crowd out healthy white cells, sapping the body's infection-fighting capabilties. Over time, leukemia cells also crowd out red blood cells and platelets, impairing the blood's ability to carry oxygen and clot.
