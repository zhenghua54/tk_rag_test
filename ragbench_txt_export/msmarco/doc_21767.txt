Later Stone Age artists (from 100,000 to roughly 40,000 BCE) would have been types of Homo sapiens like Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) - see, for instance, Gorham's Cave Art-while the first prehistoric sculptors and cave painters were forms of anatomically modern man. For more information about this period, please see: Aurignacian Art (40,000-25,000 BCE). Cave art: the earliest known example of parietal art is the El Castillo cave painting of a red-ochre dot/disk, dating to at least 39,000 BCE. Next comes two prehistoric abstract signs (claviforms) found among the Altamira cave paintings in Cantabria (c.34,000 BCE)
