To demonstrate how deferred revenue appears on a company's balance sheet as a liability and is later recognized as revenue, assume that an information technology company enters a 12-month contract on Aug. 15 to provide network support to a corporation with 50 employees. At the end of September, the balance in the deferred revenue account will be $5,500, the total advance payment for the contract minus the services provided in the first month that are now recognized in revenue.
