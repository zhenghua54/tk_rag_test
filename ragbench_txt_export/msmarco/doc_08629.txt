The Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans are fixed interest rate loans with the same repayment programs and include options for deferment and forbearance, albeit the interest on the loans can be treated differently during in-school and grace periods. Effective July 1, 2013, first-time* Direct Loan borrowers are limited in the amount of time they can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. Borrowers may receive Direct Subsidized Loans for no more than 150% of the length of the studentâ€™s current academic program (ex. 6 years for a 4-year program).
