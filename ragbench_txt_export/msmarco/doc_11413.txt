Indeed, not all hoarseness is due to laryngitis. Treatment depends on the cause. Laryngitis due to reflux is treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (prilosec, nexium, protonix, etc) medication. Laryngitis due to infection is treated with antibiotics. Laryngitis due to trauma is treated with voice rest and steroids.
