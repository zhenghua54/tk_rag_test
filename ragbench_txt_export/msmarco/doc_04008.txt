Since EDTA forms complexes with many metal ions, this particular method can only be used in the absence of such ions as Ca 2+ , Ni 2+ , etc. The reaction of complexation is: Cu 2+(aq) + (EDTA) 2–(aq) → Cu(EDTA) 2–(aq) + 2H +(aq) The stoichiometry is one metal cation to one EDTA anion. The indicator used for the titration is called murexide. This indicator is highly colored and will complex with the copper ion to give a different colored species. During the titration, the EDTA 2– forms a more stable complex and frees the indicator, which then displays its original color.
