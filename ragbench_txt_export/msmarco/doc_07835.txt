Frequency is measured using the Hz symbol meaning Hertz. The chart above shows a total span of frequencies from 20 Hz to 130,000 Hz. Noting that the limitation of the range of human hearing is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz one can easily see that frequencies exist outside of our capability to hear them.
