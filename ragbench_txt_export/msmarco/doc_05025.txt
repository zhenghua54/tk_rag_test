The average new construction cost for building a house in St. Louis  is around 120 dollars per square foot. Depending on the building  materials used and the size of the hou â€¦ se, this amount will vary. Living space can range from $100 to $125 a square foot and up depending on finishes and what kind of mechanical systems (plumbing, HVAC, electric) are involved. I've built some REALLY nicely upgraded/finished homes for $125 to $150 per square foot. $40 and up for garages is ok.
