Estradiol is a form of estrogen, a female sex hormone that's produced by the ovaries. Estradiol comes in an oral form, a transdermal skin patch, a vaginal ring, or as a topical gel, spray, or emulsion. Estradiol gel is also used to treat vaginal dryness, itching, and burning in menopausal women. Estradiol is also commonly combined with progestins in various doses in oral contraceptive pills that prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation.
