Examples of Prokaryotes. Prokaryotes are all single-celled organisms, most of which you know of as bacteria. For example, the famous (or infamous) Escherichia coli bacterium is a prokaryote, as is the streptococcus bacterium responsible for strep throat. A prokaryote is a cell without a nucleus and eukaryotes are cells that contain nuclei. There's one quick test to distinguish prokaryotes from eukaryotes: if you can see a single organism, it's a eukaryote.
