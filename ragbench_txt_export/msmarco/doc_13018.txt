Compounding is the word formation process in which two or more lexemes combine into a single new word. Compound words may be written as one word or as two words joined with a hyphen. For example: 1  noun-noun compound: note + book → notebook. 2  adjective-noun compound: blue + berry → blueberry. Clipping is the word formation process in which a word is reduced or shortened without changing the meaning of the word. Clipping differs from back-formation in that the new word retains the meaning of the original word. For example: 1  advertisement – ad. 2  alligator – gator. 3  examination – exam.
