1 Cycloalkanes are hydrocarbons containing one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached. 2  The general formula for a saturated hydrocarbon containing one ring is C n H 2n. 3  Aromatic hydrocarbons, also known as arenes, are hydrocarbons that have at least one aromatic ring. 1 The general formula for saturated hydrocarbons is C n H 2n+2 (assuming non-cyclic structures). 2  Saturated hydrocarbons are the basis of petroleum fuels and are found as either linear or branched species.
