Marine snails, smaller toads and native frogs, small snakes, and small mammals are occasionally eaten by Cane Toads.The tadpoles of Cane Toads eat algae and other aquatic plants which they rasp off with five rows of tiny peg-like teeth. They also filter organic matter from the water. Cane Toads were introduced to Australia to eat French's Cane Beetle and the Greyback Cane Beetle. The 'whitegrub' larvae of these beetles eat the roots of sugar cane and kill or stunt the plants.
