The gastric glands are located in different regions of the stomach. These are the fundic glands, the cardiac glands, and the pyloric glands. The glands are found in the gastric pits of the stomach lining. The various cells of the glands secrete mucus, pepsinogen, hydrochloric acid, intrinsic factor, gastrin, histamine and bicarbonate. The cardiac glands are found in the cardia of the stomach which is the part nearest to the heart, enclosing the opening where the oesophagus joins to the stomach. Only cardiac glands are found here and they primarily secrete mucus.
