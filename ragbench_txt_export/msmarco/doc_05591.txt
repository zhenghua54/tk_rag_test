While the Bramley apple tree has been known to live for 200 years, the average lifespan of the apple tree is closer to 100 years, with between 30 and 40 of those years being fruitful. Crabapple trees live between 30 and 50 years. The longevity of the apple tree is determined by the rootstock, and this also governs how early it bears fruit and its overall size.
