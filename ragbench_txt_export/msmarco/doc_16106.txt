Hair dyes are of two types: permanent and semipermanent. Permanent dyeing is achieved with a synthetic dye, applied with hydrogen peroxide that first bleaches the natural pigment melanin. Semipermanent dyes are generally made with vegetable extracts, such as henna, that coat rather than penetrate the hair shaft. Color is applied by the process of dyeing, which in its simplest form involves the immersion of a fabric in a solution of a dyestuff in water. Patterned effects are obtained by selectively applying dyes to fabric, for example by roller printing.
