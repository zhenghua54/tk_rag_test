Immerse the eggs in water and add a pinch of salt. This salt is to prevent the shell from breaking when it is boiling. After 10-11 min switch off the stove or whatever you are using to boil. Allow the eggs to stay in that hot water for the next 10 min and then start peeling the shell off. You should start timing the eggs from the moment the water first boils. Soft-boiled (soft whites, soft yolks): Large size: 3 minutes 20 seconds. Medium size: 3 minutes. Small size: 2 minutes 40 seconds.
