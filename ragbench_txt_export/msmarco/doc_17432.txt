I take the chicken out of the refrigerator about an hour before cooking, set the oven at 325 and roast until a thermometer in the breast reads between 160-165. Then I take it out of the oven, tent it with foil, and let it rest for 10-20 minutes. When roasting a chicken in a non-convection oven, it will cook faster and more evenly on a roasting rack than sitting low in a pan, because the part of the bird sitting low in the pan gets surrounded by a sort of 'cushion' of cooler air.
