In general, you can expect your paramedic tuition to cost anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. Know that this is just an estimate, with some programs exceeding $10,000 in cost for education and training. Take, for example, UCLA’s Paramedic Program. The cost of tuition at UCLA’s Paramedic Program is $9,500. But that cost doesn’t include expenses for things like textbooks, certificates, and uniforms. Factoring in those expenses, students can expect to pay approximately $11,300 to attend UCLA’s Paramedic Program, a program that will last roughly 8-9 months.
