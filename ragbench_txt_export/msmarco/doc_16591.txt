In 2006, more than 68 percent of computer programmers had a bachelor's degree or higher, but as the level of education and training required by employers continues to rise, this proportion is expected to increase. Computer software engineers also need skills related to the industry in which they work. Engineers working for a bank, for example, should have some expertise in finance so that they understand banks' computer needs.
