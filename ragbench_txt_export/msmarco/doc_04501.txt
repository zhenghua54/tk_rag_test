Ketel One Vodka. Most people don’t realize how vast the category of vodka is. Vodka can be made from a wide array of things, including (but not limited to) wheat, rye, corn, grapes, and potatoes. There are as many styles of vodkas as there are source ingredients. Ketel One actually gets its name from the labeling system mandated by the Dutch government for distilleries (each still has to be numbered and the oldest in the Nolets Distillery is “Distilleer Ketel 1″). The nose on Ketel One Vodka is crisp and clean, and slightly sweet with a hint of lemon.
