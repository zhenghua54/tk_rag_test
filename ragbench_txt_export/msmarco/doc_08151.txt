I chose to buy a lot of onesies in 3 months (a whole drawer full). I bought 3 new born sleepers on sale and one pack of newborns onesies. 5-8 lbs is new born 8-12 is 3 months according to the sizing so we will see. Sleepers I have 10 in 3 months one for everyday of the week and spares for accidents. I do have a couple of very light hats too. Then I have a few sleepers and outfits I've grabbed from kids swaps and second-hand stores for the 6-12 month window, but I am going to wait it out and see how many I'll need and how fast little man will grow.
