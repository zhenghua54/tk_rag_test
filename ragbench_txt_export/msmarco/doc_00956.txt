The most common type of FSA is used to pay for medical and dental expenses not paid for by insurance, usually deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance for the employee's health plan. As of January 1, 2011, over-the-counter medications are allowed only when purchased with a doctor's prescription, except for insulin. If married, both spouses must earn income for the Dependent Care FSA to work. The only exceptions are if the non-earning spouse is disabled or a full-time student. If one spouse earns less than $5,000 then the benefit is limited to whatever that spouse earned. See IRS Form 2441 Part III for details.
