In addition to the cost of the sheetrock itself, you can expect to pay for ancillary materials such as tape, fasteners and top compound. The fasteners used are specialized drywall screws that usually go for $6 per pound with 300 screws in each pound. This comes to a total of $420, or rounded up, $500 on average for labor per hour. Depending on how much sheetrock you're having installed, it might be wise to see if you can be charged by the piece instead of by the hour.
