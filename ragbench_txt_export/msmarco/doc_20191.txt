Celiac Disease-Cause. Although the exact cause of celiac disease isn't known, having certain genes increases your risk. You are more likely to have these genes if you have a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother, sister, son, or daughter) who has celiac disease. Environmental factors, such as infections, may trigger changes in the small intestine of a person with these genes.
