I am wondering what's the purpose of a BBU. My first understanding was, that it enables the cache to write the data to the disc during a power failure. But some specifications say that a BBU can hold its data for up to 72h. For this reason, RAID-5 controllers are equipped with their own caches. What the RAID controller does is it writes the data to its cache instead and LIES to the OS, telling it that it committed the data to disk whereas the data is actually still in RAID cache.
