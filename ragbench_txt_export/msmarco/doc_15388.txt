One criticism of the game is thatyoung players are drawing their conclusions about Christianity based on the game, notstudy of the Bible or discipleship mentoring from mature Christians. There are a number of ways in which technology has hurt Christianity. First, it has notdelivered on its promise of helping create stronger generations of committed Christians.The results of studies by the Barna Organization and the remarks of Dr. Corts bring thatpoint home. Keep the welfare of the souls of people at the forefront ofwhat we do, recognizing that they donâ€™t always need technology but they do needredemption provided by a loving Savior, Jesus Christ. Christians need to quit letting technology define them or set the standards for theChurch.
