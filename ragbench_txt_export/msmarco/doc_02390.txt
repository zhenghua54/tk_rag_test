Email. Polybutylene piping is a form of plastic resin and was commonly used for plumbing U.S. homes built between 1978 and 1995. Due to its inexpensive production cost and ability to withstand high water pressure, it was widely seen as a better, cheaper alternative to copper plumbing. Unfortunately, if there are polybutylene pipes within the home, or leading into the home, the best course of action is to replace the pipes entirely by hiring a re-pipe specialist. An expert can assess the current plumbing, replace the pipes and expertly patch up any holes.
