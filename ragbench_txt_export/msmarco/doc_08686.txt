HOW TO BOIL EGGS Bring eggs to room temperature before using. If the egg has been stored in the refrigerator it can be warmed gently under a flowing hot tap. Place sufficient water to cover the eggs in a saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Lower the eggs carefully into the water, using a tablespoon. You should start timing the eggs from the moment the water first boils. Soft-boiled (soft whites, soft yolks): Large size: 3 minutes 20 seconds. Medium size: 3 minutes. Small size: 2 minutes 40 seconds.
