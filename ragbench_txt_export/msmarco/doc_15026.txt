Reference. The British Thermal Unit, or BTU, is an energy unit. It is approximately the energy needed to heat one pound of water for 1 Fahrenheit. 1 BTU = 1,055 joules. 1BTU/hour = 0.293 watt. Examples 1  : One very well-insulated 1,000-square-foot home in Boston needs around 24,000 BTUs to heat in winter. Please note that this calculator can only gauge a rough estimate. You should also consider factors like efficiency decrease of the heater or air conditioner with time, the shape/type of your home or room, insulation conditions, and other factors. 1 watt is approximately 3.41214 BTU/h.
