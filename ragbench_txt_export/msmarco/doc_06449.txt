Prosthetics is the replacement of a lost limb with a prosthesis, an artificial limb that helps restore patients' mobility or function. Prosthetics technology degrees combine medical engineering technology with the study of human anatomy. Additional topics covered in the bachelor's degree program include applied kinesiology, the study of how the body's joints and muscles affect a patient's gait. These courses allow prosthetics majors to examine how a prosthetic's components compensate for the loss of a limb by assisting with balance or shock absorption.
