It should be noted that methane, by itself, when released into the atmosphere, is a potent greenhouse gas. It captures heat [70 times] better and thus, by weight, is 70 times as dangerous as carbon dioxide. This is why itâ€™s so important to flare methane to ensure that it is completely combusted into carbon dioxide. Introduction to Methane. What we call natural gas is mostly the chemical compound methane (95% or more; the rest is ethane or longer carbon chains). Methane, which comes out of the ground as a gas, is produced when microorganisms known as methanogens feed on organic matter in environments with little or no oxygen.
