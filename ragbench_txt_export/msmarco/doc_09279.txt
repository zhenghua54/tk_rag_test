The limit of f (x) as x approaches c is L .. Thus for the limit of a function to exist as the independent variable approaches c, the left-hand and right-hand limits must be equal. if and only if. When we say, then, that a function approaches a limit, we mean that Definition 2.2 has been satisfied. The limit of a function. We say that a function f(x) approaches a limit L as x approaches c if the sequence of values of x, both from the left and from the right, causes the sequence of values of f(x) to satisfy the definition of approaches a limit L: Definition 2.1.
