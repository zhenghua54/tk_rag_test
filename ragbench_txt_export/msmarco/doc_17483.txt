Those four scores are then averaged to generate the composite score used by most colleges. The average composite score is roughly a 21. That is, about 50% of test-takers score below a 21. For students who took the ACT with writing, the writing section is scored on a 12-point scale. The average score is between 7 and 8. Very few students get a perfect ACT score, even those who get into the country's top colleges. In fact, anyone scoring a 34, 35 or 36 is among the top 1% of test-takers in the country. The table above shows the middle 50% range of ACT scores for different schools.
