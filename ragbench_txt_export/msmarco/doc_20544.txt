Viakal is a blue liquid with a refreshing fragrance. It dissolves limescale and creates a water sheeting action on surfaces to prevent further limescale build-up, whilst delivering a remarkable end shine by removing the dulling effect caused by limescale deposits. Limescale is the build up of mineral deposits which occur in everyone's water supply. Householders in hard water areas (about 47% of the UK population) are particularly prone to limescale build-up, although it does occur with soft water aswell.
