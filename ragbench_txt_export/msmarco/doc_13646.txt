In some cases, symptoms of viral hepatitis are not present, and some people are not even aware that anything is wrong until signs of cirrhosis appear. When a person becomes infected with one of the viruses that cause viral hepatitis, the virus begins to multiply within the liver. Within two weeks (or as long as six months, depending on the virus), a person may develop viral hepatitis symptoms.
