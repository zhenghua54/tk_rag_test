DEFINITION of 'Misrepresentation'. A false statement of fact made by one party which affects the other party's decision in agreeing to a contract. If the misrepresentation is discovered, the contract can be later declared void and the situation remedied if the party who relied on the misrepresented fact files suit. For this reason, it is important to be accurate when disclosing facts relevant to a contract negotiation. Next Up.
