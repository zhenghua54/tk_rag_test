1 On average, the cost of porcelain veneers can vary anywhere from as little as $1,500 to as much as $20,000. 2  The pricing has such as wide range because each personâ€™s teeth vary. 3  With that being said, replacing a few teeth with porcelain veneers will be a lot cheaper than replacing a full set of teeth. 1 If you want to budget per tooth, some dentists will tell you it can be anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500 per tooth. 2  According to some dentists on the website RealSelf.com, you should expect to budget anywhere from $2,000 to $20,000 for the entire procedure.
