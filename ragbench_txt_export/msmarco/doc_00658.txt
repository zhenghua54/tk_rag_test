Diagnosing a Seizure in a Child. Diagnosing a seizure can be tricky. Seizures are over so quickly that your doctor probably will never see your child having one. The first thing a doctor needs to do is rule out other conditions, such as nonepileptic seizures. In most cases -- about seven out of 10 -- the cause of the seizures can't be identified. This type of seizure is called idiopathic or cryptogenic, meaning that we don't know what causes them. The problem may be with an uncontrolled firing of neurons in the brain that triggers a seizure.
