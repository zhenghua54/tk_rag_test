Giraffes tend to live in hot exotic places for example, some parts of Africa. http://www.wikipedia.org.uk/giraffes There is only one continent in the world where giraffes live. It is Africa. Giraffes choose to live on the flat, grassy areas with some trees and bushes. In Africa these areas are called savannas. We can also call them grasslands or woodlands.
