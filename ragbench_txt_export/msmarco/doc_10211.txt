Annual Exams. All healthy dogs should visit the vet at least once a year, and twice a year is advisable. Older dogs may need to see a vet every six months or more frequently. This gives the vet the opportunity to examine your dog and ensure that the dog is healthy. The vet will complete a physical examination, take your dogâ€™s temperature, listen to his heart and look at his teeth, among other things.
