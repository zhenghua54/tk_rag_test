Note: Currently, the maximum amount that one individual may receive for SSI disability is $721 per month. Social Security disability is very different in some ways than SSI disability. If it is very low, however, you may be eligible to receive both SSI and social security disability. This is known as a concurrent claim. On the other hand, if you have had higher earnings and consistent work activity, your monthly disability benefit pay will be higher.
