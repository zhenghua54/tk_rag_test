Whether to use a metallic Equipment Grounding Circuit per Table 250-122 or to rely on the conductor enclosure to serve as the Equipment Grounding Circuit is a question that must be answered by the design engineer, electrical contractor, electrician, and electrical inspector. In the second category we could include all industrial plants where a metallic Equipment Grounding Circuit sized per Table 250-122, must be run parallel with and within the conductor enclosure so as to ensure continuity if that circuit is broken owing to corrosion sooner or later.
