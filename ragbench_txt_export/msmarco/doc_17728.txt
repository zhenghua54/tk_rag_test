1 Endometriosis. 2  Endometriosis is a chronic and often progressive disease that develops when the tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grows onto other areas, such as the ovaries, bowels, or bladder. 3  It often causes chronic pelvic pain. Blood tests can help rule out other conditions that cause menstrual disorders. For example, your doctor may test thyroid function to make sure that low thyroid (hypothyroidism) is not present. Blood tests can also check follicle-stimulating hormone, estrogen, and prolactin levels.
