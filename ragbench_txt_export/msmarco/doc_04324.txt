My last entry sparked quite the debate over the color of saffron, so I feel the need to address this issue before we move on. Saffron, actually, is neither orange nor yellow. It is somewhat reddish in tone, although I have to admit that I am not the best measure of this. My left eye sees things in bluish tones, and my right in reddish tones.
