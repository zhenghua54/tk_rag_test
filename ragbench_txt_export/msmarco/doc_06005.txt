Galvanizing protects in two ways: 1  It forms a coating of corrosion-resistant zinc which prevents corrosive substances from reaching the more delicate part of the metal. 2  The zinc serves as a sacrificial anode so that even if the coating is scratched, the exposed steel will still be protected by the remaining zinc. The earliest known example of galvanizing of iron, encountered by Europeans is found on 17th century Indian armor in the Royal Armouries Museum collection. It was named in English via French from the name of Italian scientist Luigi Galvani.
