Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency (PDCD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders associated with abnormal mitochondrial metabolism. The citric acid cycle is a major biochemical process that derives energy from carbohydrates. All children are born with some residual enzyme activity, because a complete deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is incompatible with life. Infants with 15% or less pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity normally do not survive the newborn period.
