An employee's or candidate's salary depends on a myriad of factors: how much relevant industry experience he or she has, what the candidate can bring to the table, what a fair pay scale is, and how much of an investment you're making in your company’s future. If they bring in enough business, what’s a fair salary to pay them? For example, if someone sells $400,000 to $500,000 worth of your company’s products or services annually, a low six-figure salary is justifiable.
