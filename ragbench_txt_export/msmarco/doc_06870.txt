Sets are immature onions. Walla Walla onions are sweet white onions that are mild enough to eat raw. The sets, which are small bulbs, mature in about 56 days, producing a flattish tan-skinned onion. Space the rows 12 to 24 inches apart. Place a Walla Walla onion set in the row every 3 to 4 inches. Cover the sets with soil, but do not firm the soil over the top of the sets. This can compact the soil and make it difficult for the onion sprout to break through the soil
