If the tenant fails to vacate the property within the period specified by the Accelerated Possession Order, you can apply to the Court for a warrant for bailiffs to evict the tenant on your behalf. The possession order will normally take effect two weeks after the decision unless the court decides that this would cause the tenant exceptional hardship. In that case, the judge may delay the order for up to six weeks.
