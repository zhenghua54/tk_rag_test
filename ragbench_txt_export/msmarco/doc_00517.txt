The planet that is closest to Earth depends on where the other planets are in relation to Earth. Venus can come the closest when it is on the same side of the Sun as the Earth â€¦ , but Mars can be closest when Venus is on the far side of the Sun and Mars is on the same side of the sun as Earth. So the distance between Earth and any other planet changes over a wide range, depending on whether we're both on the same side of the sun or on opposite sides. At any given time, the planet closest to Earth could be either Mercury, Venus, or Mars.
