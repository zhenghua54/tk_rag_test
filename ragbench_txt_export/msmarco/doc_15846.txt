The total inorganic carbon (C T, or TIC) or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is the sum of inorganic carbon species in a solution. The inorganic carbon species include carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, bicarbonate anion, and carbonate. It is customary to express carbon dioxide and carbonic acid simultaneously as CO 2 * . C T is a key parameter when making measurements related to the pH of natural aqueous systems, and carbon dioxide flux estimates
