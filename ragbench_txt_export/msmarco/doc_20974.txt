Shea Butter is extracted from the nuts of the Shea-Karite tree. This tree only begins to produce nuts after about fifteen years and it can take up to 30 years to get the first quality crop from a particular tree. The producers are waiting for the nut to contain a high concentration of irremovable fatty acid.
