When you export PDFs to different file formats using the Export PDF tool, each file format includes unique conversion settings. This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help. If you want to use the same settings every time you convert PDFs to a particular format, specify those settings in the Preferences dialog box. In the Convert From PDF panel, select a file format from the list and click Edit Settings.
