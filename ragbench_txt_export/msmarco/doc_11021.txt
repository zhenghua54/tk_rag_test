Best Answer: It typically takes 15-25 minutes to feel the full effects of the medication, sometimes it can be faster on an empty stomach and a bit slower on a fuller stomach. If you are still in pain, I myself would take another pill. If you wait too long before taking pain medication the pain can become unmanageable. Two pills is fine to take. Be careful not to take more than 8 in a 24 hr period because of the tylenol.
