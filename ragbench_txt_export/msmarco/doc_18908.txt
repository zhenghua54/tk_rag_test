Your doctor may suggest having a steroid injection if one or more of your joints are affected by arthritis or inflammation, including your shoulder, knee, elbow or wrist joints. Steroid joint injections can help reduce pain and swelling in your joint and allow it to move more easily. A steroid injection can be repeated every three months. However, long-term use of steroids can affect your mood, interfere with your menstrual cycle if you're a woman and weaken your bones and muscles. Repeat injections can also damage the joint.
