In other words, the limit of (sin x)/ x as x approaches zero equals 1. In mathematics, the limit of a function is a fundamental concept in calculus and analysis concerning the behavior of that function near a particular input. Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. The function f is continuous at p if and only if the limit of f (x) as x approaches p exists and is equal to f (p). If f: M â†’ N is a function between metric spaces M and N, then it is equivalent that f transforms every sequence in M which converges towards p into a sequence in N which converges towards f (p).
