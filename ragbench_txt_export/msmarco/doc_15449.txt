People all know what a cactus is, but there is a lot more to it than just something that has prickly pieces to it. You will find that there is a lot of history that you can get out of this plant and it can be fun to understand the meaning. Cactus actually comes from a Greek word “kaktos” which of course is a plant that has spiny thistles to protect it. You will find that there are a few other names people know it by; one of the most entertaining is “Mother-in-law’s Cushion.” As a floral meaning, the cactus represents longevity and endurance; this is a plant that can handle what is thrown at it in terms of the elements.
