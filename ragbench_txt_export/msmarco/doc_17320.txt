More specifically, you could be experiencing hardwood floor splitting because: 1  The wood was installed in an uncontrolled environment —meaning it was outside the 35 – 55 percent relative humidity (RH) range that’s used throughout the industry. 2  The wood wasn’t acclimated properly before installation. If you have a very damp crawlspace, the moisture can seep through the subfloor. This can cause your floors to take on the moisture and then release it into the room, resulting in hardwood floor splitting.
