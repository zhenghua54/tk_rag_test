Vomiting is one of the symptoms of toxicity, along with nausea and depression. These are just a few of the more common causes of vomiting – there are many more. If your pet is vomiting, it’s important to address it by taking your cat or dog to the vet. Although eating too quickly may be a one-off or a regular occurrence, it can lead to indigestion and vomiting. The best way to combat this is to feed small meals regularly throughout the day. Some breed-specific diets (eg Labradors) help slow their rate of ingestion. You could also try a scoff-stopper bowl.
