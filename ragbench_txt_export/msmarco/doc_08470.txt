Unlike other winter squash, butternutâ€™s skin is thin and easy to peel, but it can easily be cut in half and roasted with the skin intact, providing simple preparation with significant nutrition in the form of vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber. Butternut squash contains both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber.
