According to the most common theory of fossil fuels, it is believed that these fuels were formed from the corpse of animals as well as plants that got buried under the earth's crust due to certain reasons. There are two different theories of fossil fuels that are known as Biogenic theory and Abiogenic theory. The fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. These are actually hydrocarbons that remain inside the earth's crust. There are different types of fossil fuels like petroleum, methane, coal and so on. Some of these are made up of pure carbon and others are of low ratio of carbon and hydrogen.
