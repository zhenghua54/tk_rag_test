The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created on December 2, 1970, by executive order of President Richard Nixon to permit coordinated and effective government action on behalf of the environment.. Fifteen different environmental programs from various federal offices were combined and placed under the jurisdiction of the newly created EPA. The EPA was designed to serve as an umbrella agency through which most federal environmental laws, regulations, and policies would be administered.
