After you know all the regulations, you will have to start measuring your yard for your footage. The recommended footage for a fence post is 6 â€“ 8 feet apart. The average price per foot of fence at 4 feet high, is between $15.00 - $30.00 per foot, not including installation. That should also include posts, caps, rails and pickets. So this should give you at least a base price. Shop around and look for the best deals
