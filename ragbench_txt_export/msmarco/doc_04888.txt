_I. Definition and Scripture Terms._. The word angel is applied in Scripture to an order of supernatural or heavenly beings whose business it is to act as God's messengers to men, and as agents who carry out His will. The angels of the presence of God, who do not appear to correspond to our conception of guardian angels, are specially interested in God's little ones (Matthew 18:10). Finally, the existence of angels is implied in the Lord's Prayer in the petition, Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth (Matthew 6:10).
