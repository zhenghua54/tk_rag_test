What you have to do will depend on what country you are in, or whether you are traveling internationally. Travel within the United States. If you are on a domestic flight in the US, there is no limit to the amount of cash or monetary instruments that you can carry. However, the TSA may ask a passenger who is carrying a large sum of cash to account for the money.
