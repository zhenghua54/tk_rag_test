How long do I have to wait to get my copy? Doctors and hospitals have 30 days from the time they receive your written request to give you the copy of your medical records. In practice, your records are usually copied and ready for you to receive in person in a week to 10 days. Doctors may charge you no more than $1 per page or $100 for your entire medical record, whichever amount is less. If your record is fewer than 10 pages, the doctor is allowed to charge you $10. Doctors are also allowed to charge an administrative fee of no more than $10 or 10% of the copying cost, whichever is less.
