ADP is World Vision’s acronym for Area Development Program. It is a distinct geographical area where we partner with local stakeholders to improve the well-being of children through multiple sector projects aimed at root causes of issues that negatively impact children. World Vision sponsorship is designed toward our belief that the most effective way to provide for a child is to address issues at the community level to improve the situation for all children and to reflect God’s love as we serve.
