Capillary electrophoresis is an analytical separation technique of electrophoresis. The capillary electrophoresis is a high resolution separation technique. The separation of ions is based on the electrophoretic mobility of ions under an applied voltage. The capillary electrophoresis is easy method and can be used for small ions to macromolecules like proteins, peptides, chiral compounds, nucleic acid. The electrophoresis involves the migration of ions and the opposite charged ions are attracted towards to the oppositely charged electrodes.
