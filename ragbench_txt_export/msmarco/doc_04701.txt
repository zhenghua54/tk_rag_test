A woodlouse (plural woodlice), also known by many common names (see below), is an isopod crustacean with a rigid, segmented, long exoskeleton and fourteen jointed limbs. Pill millipedes can be distinguished from woodlice on the basis of having two pairs of legs per body segment instead of one pair like all isopods. Pill millipedes have twelve to thirteen body segments, with a large shield-like posterior segment, whereas woodlice have eleven, and small posterior segments.
