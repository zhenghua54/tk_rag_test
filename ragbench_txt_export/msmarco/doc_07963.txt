Microfiber is also ideal for buyers with children, since it is very easy to clean when compared to other types of sofa fabric. Since microfiber is water repellant, it handles spills well, keeping them on the surface rather than letting them seep into the sofaâ€™s padding and potentially causing smells. Another way to search for sofas and sofa fabric on eBay is by clicking the Home, Outdoors & Decor category on the eBay homepage and then selecting Home & Garden. Next, click Furniture, then Sofas, Loveseats & Chaises, and then click the checkbox beside Sofa to see all of the applicable listings.
