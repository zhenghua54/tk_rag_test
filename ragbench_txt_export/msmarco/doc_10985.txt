â–  Figure 9.3 The pathway of sympathetic neurons. The preganglionic neurons enter the sympathetic chain of ganglia on the white ramus (one of the two rami communicantes). Some synapse there, and the postganglionic axon leaves on the grey ramus to rejoin a spinal nerve. Others pass through the ganglia without synapsing.
