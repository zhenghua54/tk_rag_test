That settled it -- moist it was for the cold sore. I made sure to eat my sauce messily, so that covered me a little, but I'm sure Oma knew. Sorry, Oma -- your brats would have pulled you even and made for a long night for me. But the salad just didn't cut it. Specifically, today I want to talk about treating a cold sore, and whether it is better to let it dry out, or to keep it moist. This topic came up the other day when I was talking to a patient about cold sores. He told me about his two grandmothers and their conflicting views on treating everything, cold sores included.
