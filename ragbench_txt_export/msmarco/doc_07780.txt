Temperature: Tomato plants drop their flowers under extreme temperature regimes, such as high daytime temperatures (above 85°F), high nighttime temperatures (above 70°F), or low nighttime temperatures (below 55°F) (Table 1). Optimal growing conditions for tomatoes are daytime temperatures between 70°F and 85°F.
