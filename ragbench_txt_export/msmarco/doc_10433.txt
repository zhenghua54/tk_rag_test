Iridium is white, similar to platinum, but with a slight yellowish cast. It is very hard and brittle, making it very hard to machine, form, or work. It is the most corrosion resistant metal known, and was used in making the standard metre bar of Paris, which is a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy.ridium has no biological role. Iridium is found as the free element alloyed with platinum and other platinum metals. Naturally occurring alloys include osmiridium and iridiosmium, both mixtures of iridium and osmium.
