Farrier costs vary from region to region. In the central Illinois area (again excluding Chicago and suburbs), farrier costs for your horse can range from about $30 (for a trim) to over $100 for a full set of shoes. Most horses need to be shod about every six weeks. This is an very important factor to consider when thinking of buying a horse.
