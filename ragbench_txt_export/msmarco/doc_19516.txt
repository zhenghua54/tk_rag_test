If you wait to withdraw from your RRSP until age 71 -- when the account must be collapsed and converted into a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or registered annuity -- you'll be affected by the minimum withdrawal requirements. In the first year, you must withdraw 7.38% from the RRIF, Diamond notes. Now, let's say Bob also has a $500,000 RRSP. He deferred withdrawing from his RRSP until he converted it to a RRIF at age 71. The mandatory 7.38% means he must withdraw $36,900 in the year he turns 72. That significantly increases Bob's taxable income to $87,900, which moves him to a higher tax bracket.
