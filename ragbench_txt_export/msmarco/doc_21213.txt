Some conditions, such as severe kidney disease, may prevent you from being given contrast material for having an MRI. If you are scheduled to have MR or CT arthrography and have claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) or anxiety, you may want to ask your physician about being sedated prior to the scheduled examination. Jewelry and other accessories should be left at home if possible, or removed prior to the MRI scan.
