The costs of using a well-tested system to launch payloads are high. Prices range from about $4,300/kg for a Proton launch to about US$ 40,000/kg for a Pegasus launch (2004). Some systems under development, such as the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, offer rates as low as $1,600/kg. For a space elevator, the cost varies according to the design. Bradley C. Edwards received funding from NIAC from 2001 to 2003 to write a paper, describing a space elevator design. In it he stated that: The first space elevator would reduce lift costs immediately to $100 per pound ($220/kg)
