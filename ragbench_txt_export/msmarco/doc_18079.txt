In roots the ground tissue may store sugars or starches to fuel the spring sap flow. In leaves, the ground tissue is that layer doing photosythesis, the mesophyll. Bark or Dermal Tissue. Dermal tissues generally occupy the skin layer of all plant organs including trees. These bark tissues are responsible for controlling environmental conditions that continually interact and effect the tree's outside.
