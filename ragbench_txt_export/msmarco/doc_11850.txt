Goals-against average, or GAA, is calculated by taking the number of goals scored on a goaltender, multiplying that figure by 60 (the number of minutes in a standard NHL game), and dividing the result by the total number of minutes the goaltender has played so far (GAA = (goals scored on x 60) / minutes played). Most goaltenders finish a season with a goals-against average of between 2.0 and 3.0. A goals-against average under 2.0 is excellent, and a GAA over 3.0 is considered high.
