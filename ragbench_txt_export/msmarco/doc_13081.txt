Enamel hypoplasia is a defect associated with incomplete formation of organic enamel, which covers the teeth. In this condition, the enamel is thin and soft, which causes it to chip off and exposing the underlying dentin. There are two basic types-hereditary and environmental, which are associated with different causes. Enamel hypoplasia can be categorized into two basic types, based on the causative factors associated with the condition. 1  Hereditary type enamel hypoplasia: This condition is associated with disturbance during the embryonic development, especially in the ectoderm. 2  The other components of embryonic development are normal.
