Only 49 days later, on December 16, 1707, Mt. Fuji erupted. It is commonly thought that a major earthquake in Mt. Fuji's general area could setoff the required chain-reaction for a major eruption, and many say that the Tohoku earthquake of 2011 in the north of Japan could have already set this process in motion.

The mountain's symbolism for the country and natural beauty cannot be denied, and it is something of a pilgrimage destination for people, not only from Japan, but from around the world.
