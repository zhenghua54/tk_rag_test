Overview. With big, showy flowers of blue, white or pink, hydrangeas catch the eye wherever they bloom. Hydrangeas can grow in North Texas; however, they require special attention to soil preparation and care to overcome the clay soil in most of the area. Hydrangeas bloom from May through early summer. The plants like morning sun, but need protection in the summer from North Texas' hot afternoon rays. Be sure the site is well-drained and has enough space for hydrangea plants--check the plant container's label to find out expected mature size since some hydrangeas can grow over 10 feet tall.
