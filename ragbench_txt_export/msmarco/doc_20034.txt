The loin is the back of the pig, and it runs from shoulder to leg. (If you visualize a pig and imagine that the shoulders, hams and belly have been removed, what you have left is the loin.) The loin is sold in chops and roasts, both with and without bone and the loin is cut into a number of sections. Therefore, a sirloin roast is a roast cut from the ham end and it is quite lean; a blade roast is a roast that is cut from the shoulder end of the loin and is somewhat fattier. The leaner cuts should not be cooked past medium (and is even better served medium-rare).
