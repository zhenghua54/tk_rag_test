Plumeria produces somewhat flat, fragrant flowers. While both add a tropical flair to the garden with their lush foliage and attractive, often fragrant flowers, hibiscus and plumeria come from two different plant families. Hibiscus belongs to the mallow, or Malvacaea family, and is related to both hollyhocks (Alcea rosea) and cotton (Gossypium barbadense). Growing to about 30 feet tall, plumeria's round canopy spreads as wide as the tree is tall. Depending on species and cultivar, plumeria foliage may be as much as 12 inches long and the trees may be deciduous or evergreen.
