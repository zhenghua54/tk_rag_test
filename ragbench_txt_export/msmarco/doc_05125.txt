Example. An options trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ stock trading at $50 in June and writes a JUL 55 out-of-the-money call for $2. So he pays $5000 for the 100 shares of XYZ and receives $200 for writing the call option giving a total investment of $4800. On expiration date, the stock had rallied to $57. Potential losses for this strategy can be very large and occurs when the price of the underlying security falls. However, this risk is no different from that which the typical stockowner is exposed to. In fact, the covered call writer's loss is cushioned slightly by the premiums received for writing the calls.
