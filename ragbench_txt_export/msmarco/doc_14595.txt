This war followed the First Indochina War (1946–54) and was fought between North Vietnam —supported by the Soviet Union, China and other communist allies—and the government of South Vietnam —supported by the United States, Philippines and other anti-communist allies. The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties).
