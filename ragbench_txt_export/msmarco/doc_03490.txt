The literal answer for a first conviction is that a New York speeding ticket costs between $45 and $600. For speeding 1 to 10 mph over the limit the range is $45 to $150. For speeding 11 mph to 30 mph, the range is $90 to $300. Finally, for speeding 31 mph or more, the range is $180 to $600. Because points from New York transfer to Ontario, we recommend that you fight this speeding ticket. This is an 8-point ticket in New York and transfers as 6 demerit points in Ontario. It also carries roughly a $300 fine plus a $450 Driver Assessment Fee.
