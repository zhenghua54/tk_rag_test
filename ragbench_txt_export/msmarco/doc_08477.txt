Next time you shop for skin care products, make your way to the produce aisle and pick up some squash. Butternut would be ideal. No, you don't rub it on your face. The veggie works from the inside out, thanks to its rich supply of pH-balancing and skin-cell-turnover-boosting vitamin A. Butternut squash is one of the best things you can eat to get more vitamin A from your diet. And you want more, because vitamin A and healthy skin go hand in hand.
