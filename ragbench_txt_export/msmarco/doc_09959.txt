Kangaroos are herbivorous and the female kangaroo has a pouch for the joey (baby). Kangaroos are well known for their jumping capabilities and use their tails to help balance. A kangaroo cannot jump if its tail is lifted off the ground. The kangaroos on Kangaroo Island are herbivores, primarily eating grass and other vegetation, feeding in the early morning and late afternoon/evening towards sunset. Besides g â€¦ rass, they eat young shoots and tender leaves of native shrubs.
