Equine Gestation. Miniature ponies, and all other breeds of horses, typically carry their foals for approximately 11 months. The average miniature horse mare will carry her foal for around 330 days before giving birth. The actual length of pregnancy can vary between 320 days and 380 days. Every mare is different, so if you're not sure exactly how long your mare normally carries her foals, you should start watching her for signs of delivery when she's about 300 days from her most recent breeding.
