Psyllium in breakfast cereal adds both soluble and insoluble fiber. The unique characteristics of psyllium fiber have led to its use as a food supplement and additive. Psyllium is composed of about 70 percent soluble fiber, which forms a gel in your intestines, binding to cholesterol and helping to slow digestion. About 30 percent of psyllium is insoluble fiber that contributes bulk to stool and helps to stimulate its movement through your intestinal tract, which improves bowel regularity.
