DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Sitagliptin is an oral drug that reduces blood sugar (glucose) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin is a member of a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and are therefore called DPP-4 inhibitors. As a result, blood glucose levels fall. In summary, sitagliptin reduces blood glucose levels by inhibiting DPP-4 and increasing the levels of GLP-1 and GIP. Sitagliptin was approved by the FDA in October 2006.
