Clam Juice is actually broth from clams, sold in small bottles. To make Clam Juice, clams are shucked, then briefly steamed. The steaming water becomes a broth. It is strained to get any grit or sediment out, then bottled. Most brands add no artificial preservatives, just salt. The clam meat is then packaged and sold separately. The Juice has a salty, sea flavour to it.
