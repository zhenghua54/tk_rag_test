Signs and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are related to the decreased blood carbon dioxide levels, and include peripheral paraesthesia. In addition, the alkalosis may disrupt calcium ion balance, and cause the symptoms of hypocalcaemia (such as tetany and fainting) with no fall in total serum calcium levels. However, chronic respiratory alkalosis leads to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, by inducing renal PTH-resistance. There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3-5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality. 1  Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. 2  For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation.
