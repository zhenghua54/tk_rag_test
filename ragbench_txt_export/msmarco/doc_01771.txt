A covalent bond forming H 2 (right) where two hydrogen atoms share the two electrons. A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one sigma and one pi bond, and a triple bond is one sigma and two pi bonds. Covalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond.
