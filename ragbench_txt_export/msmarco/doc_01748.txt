Method: After draining the ghee, you will find some residue at the bottom of the pan. Do not drain all of the ghee. Leave a couple of teaspoons of ghee. To this residue add wheat flour and keep stirring in reduced heat in the same pan, until the raw smell goes away from the wheat flour. To this add sugar and keep mixing.
