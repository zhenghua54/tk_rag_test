A number of disinfectant and antiseptic products are available under the Dettol brand including disinfectants for surfaces, antiseptics for use on the body, wipes and sprays. Here we will concentrate on the ‘core’ product-the liquid antiseptic, Figure 5. Figure 5: Dettol liquid antiseptic, contains chloroxylenol. The active germ-killing ingredient in Dettol is in fact 4-chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol, also known by its non-systematic name para-chloro-meta-xylenol or PCMX, Figure 4. The prefix para is a non-systematic way of indicating the 4- position on the benzene ring, ie opposite the −OH group.
