If your car is worth $10,000 and it’s insured with two companies, you could conceivably get a payout of $20,000 if the car were wrecked and you filed claims with both companies. Even though several parties can have insurable interest, it’s not necessary for each interested party to carry his own policy on the car. In fact, doing so could create significant problems when it comes time to collect. Insurance companies are like any other business in that they’re in it to make money.
