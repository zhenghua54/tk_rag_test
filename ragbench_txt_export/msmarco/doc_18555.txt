I have fitted hundreds of individuals in scleral lenses, and the cost aspect has been a sticking point for only a small percentage of them. Once they have had the opportunity to try on a lens, feel the comfort, and see the vision, the price of the lens becomes secondary. Right now, scleral lenses are a niche lens for a small population of patients, but that is up to us as practitioners to make them more of a mainstream option. As mentioned previously, GPs made up a substantial percentage of contact lens wearers as recently as 25 years ago.
