Yes, one litter of puppies can have multiple fathers, so long as the mother was bred with multiple partners during a time when she had viable eggs. Since multiple eggs are released by the mother, sperm from different fathers could fertilize each egg. It is even possible in humans for twins to have two different fathers.
