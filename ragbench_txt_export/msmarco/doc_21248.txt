Most Baltic Sea amber (Estonia and Latvia) comes from 25-40 meters beneath the ground. Cretaceous amber can be found in California, and Poland (along the northwest side of Gdansk Bay, Bay of Danzig and Baltic coastline, amber can still be found), and in Siberia as well. Amber's color can vary depending on the source of the hardened tree resin. For example, the most common golden yellow, white, and ivory colored amber comes from pine trees. Cherry and plum trees produce an amber with more red, orange and brown tones.
