There is no one who will come and remove toads or other amphibians from you garden. If you wish to exclude any species you will need to look at modifying the habitats in your garden so they are less attractive, although bare in mind this will have impacts on all wildlife. Common Frogs are frequently found in urban areas and gardens are an important amphibian habitat in their own right. If the animal is trapped or in danger – e.g. you’ve found it near a road or in a part of the garden you’re working on – release it into a nearby suitable habitat or another part of the garden.
