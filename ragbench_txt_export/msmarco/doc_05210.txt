BIOMBO (BASHIBIOMBO, BENA BIOMBO). Demicratic Republic of the Congo. Biombo people occupy a territory limited to the region directly south of the junction of the Lulua and Kasai Rivers. The masks attributed to them have surface decoration related to that of the Eastern Pende, notably surfaces with dark and white triangles, but the principal mask shapes show Kuba influence. The Biombo are, however, an entirely different group from the Kuba, with stylistic forms drawn from a variety of sources. The top of the mask often terminates in three short stubs. The masks were worn in circumcision rites.
