They are both a blessing and a curse. Neither science nor technology in and of themselves are good or bad. It is what we as humans choose to do with science and technolo â€¦ gy that is good or bad. In some cases even something we do that is bad can lead to good. For example nuclear weapons are clearly bad. Blessing...Or Curse, inovations and change improve things for some and do damage to others. When the telephone became accepted and vogue, telegraphers who failed to educate themselves and rapidly adopt to the new technology lost employment, the equipment became worthless, and they became destitute.
