A neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU), also known as an intensive care nursery (ICN), is an intensive-care unit specializing in the care of ill or premature newborn infants. The first American newborn intensive care unit, designed by Louis Gluck, was opened in October 1960 at Yale-New Haven Hospital, Connecticut. The definition of a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) according to the National Center for Statistics is a hospital facility or unit staffed and equipped to provide continuous mechanical ventilatory support for a newborn infant.
