1. Local building permit costs & lay of property: Depending on what municipality/region you build in, pricing for building & development costs can range from as low as $10,000 to $30,000. For example, on a 1,800 square foot home, this translates to a difference of $11.00 per square foot. Building a house on a low-grade property most likely requires extra work in regards to raising the grade and bringing in extra loads of fill. An estimate is just that: 'an estimate;' until a clearer picture of what is being built, by whom, and where, is finalized. Generally, we find the 'price per square foot' rate to be around: •$110-$130 per square foot to build a house your own (self build). •$160 - $200 per square foot to hire a custom home builder.
