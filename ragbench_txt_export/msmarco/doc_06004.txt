Galvanizing is the practice of immersing clean, oxide-free steel into molten zinc to from a protective coating over the metal. The coating is bonded metallurgically to the steel and this coating helps to protect the surface against corrosion. In recent use, the term refers to the coating of steel or iron with zinc. 1 Electro-Galvanizing: It is an electrolytic process for galvanizing, where a thinner, tighter bonding coat of zinc is applied to a metal through “electroplating”. 2  Electro plating is a process of running a current of electricity through a saline/ zinc solution with a zinc anode and steel conductor.
