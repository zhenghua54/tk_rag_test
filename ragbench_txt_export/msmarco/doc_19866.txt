Seed plants: There are two main subdivisions of seed plantsâ€”the ones without covered seeds, the gymnosperms, and the ones with covered seeds, the angiosperms. In this tutorial we will briefly look at both types of plants. Angiosperms are plants that have seeds encased in a protective covering. That covering is the ovary which is part of the flower structure and distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms, the other seed plants.
