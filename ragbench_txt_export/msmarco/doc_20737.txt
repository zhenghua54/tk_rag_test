The thin structure that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell is called as cell membrane. This is present in most plant, animal and fungi cells. It is a selectively permeable stru â€¦ cture and allows the flow of ions and particles from the inside of the cell to the outside and vice-versa. However plant cells, in addition to the cell membrane also have the cell wall outside the cell membrane. This provides mechanical rigidity to the cell and prevents the flow of larger particles. 7 people found this useful.
