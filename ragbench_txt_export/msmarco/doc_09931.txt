How to drill a clean hole through tile-porcelain, clay, glass, hard tile. There will be times when you are tiling that you will need to cut a hole through the tile to allow for plumbing or electrical wires. This is a very effective method for drilling through any type of tile using a drill and a carbide tile bit. I, on the other hand, liked the video very much, and have tried for the longest time to drill through glass without success. If you are talking about drilling through glass table tops or something like that, you can really only drill holes using this method through glass that is not tempered. If you try to drill through tempered glass-it will crack and splinter in a giant mess. Not true.
