Best Answer: The pulse is a spurt of a wave. SONAR best exemplifies this. If the sub's captains says give me one ping of the SONAR, he will get one pulse or spurt of one wave of sound. As there is but one pulse, the wave travels through water at velocity v and that one wave's energy compresses and releases water as the wave travels through the water.
