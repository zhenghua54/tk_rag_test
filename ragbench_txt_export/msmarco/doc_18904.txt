Overview. The shoulder joint is formed by the upper arm bone and the shoulder blade. These bones form a ball-and-socket joint that can move in any direction. A bony roof sits over the top of the shoulder joint. Tendons from muscles that move the shoulder joint travel between the upper arm bone and this roof. Immediate Care. Cortisone shots can cause a flare reaction in the first 24 to 48 hours. This can be caused by the body responding to the needle injury or from small crystals that form in the injected tissue.
