Wi-Fi access points can function in either “ad-hoc” or “infrastructure” mode, and many WI-Fi-enabled devices can only connect to infrastructure-mode networks, not ad-hoc ones. For example, you can create an ad-hoc network from the Control Panel in Windows or create an ad-hoc network on your Ubuntu Linux machine. This is fine if you want to connect two laptops, but it’s very inconvenient if you need to connect a device that only supports networks in infrastructure mode.
