get yourself a cooking thermometer. the important thing is to cook your meats and fish to the right temp. Chicken legs (or any chick part) should be 165 degrees at the thicke â€¦ st part. As for how long and what temperature: id say bake at 350 for about 45 minutes. But check the temp. at 30 minutes to see if they are done. and adjust your time from there. Ill give a link below with baked chick legs recipes. 17 people found this useful
