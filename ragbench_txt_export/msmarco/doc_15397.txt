Yes, it does! Another very significant issue to overcome when you want use fabric for draping is the weight of the material. You have to find a satin or sateen that is light enough to use in ceiling draping. Use the wrong fabric, or too much fabric, and you could literally pull down a drop ceiling installation. Because of that, one of the things you want to look for is what the ‘denier’ of the fabric is. In the Past, we have written and talked a lot about the Gossamer Fabric often referred to as Tobacco Cloth. It’s a terrific lightweight fabric that we frequently use on drop down ceilings. What we haven’t talked about much is the ‘ 40 Denier Satin Fabric ‘ that we’re crazy about and use a TON!
