When you move home, there may be some costs associated. Costs will vary depending on the type of Move Home transfer and you will be advised of this prior to carrying out the transfer. For example, if you require a technician, fees will apply for the technician's time. If you wish to have your TV equipment moved, a standard $100 fee will apply, however if you self-install your existing Foxtel TV box at your new address, you won't have to pay this fee. We will let you know if a self-install is possible when you contact us about your move house arrangements. 1 We will then organise the switch off date at your existing address and the switch on date at your new address. 2  Please note, if you are moving multiple Foxtel services, you may not be able to have all your services connected on the same 'switch on' date.
