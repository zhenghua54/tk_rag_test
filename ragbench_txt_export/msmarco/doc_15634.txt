Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. Antioxidants are chemicals which may help reduce risk of cancer. Since vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body.
