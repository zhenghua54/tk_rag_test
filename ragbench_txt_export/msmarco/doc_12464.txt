Nestea was distributed jointly by Coca-Cola and Nestle, with Coca-Cola providing the formula and Nestle the name. A divorce between Coca-Cola and Nestle in September 2012 lead to Nestle keeping the name but Coca-Cola introduced the repackaged Fuze tea. Fuze Tea is a re-branding of the Nestea brand. Under the agreement, Nestle got the name while Coke got the taste.
