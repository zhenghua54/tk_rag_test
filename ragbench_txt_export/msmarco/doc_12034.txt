In September 1519, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan set sail with a fleet of five Spanish ships in attempt to find the Spice Islands by heading west. He also discovered what is now called the Strait of Magellan and named both the Pacific Ocean and South America's Tierra del Fuego. Magellanic Clouds in space were also named for him, as his crew was the first to view them while sailing in the Southern Hemisphere.
