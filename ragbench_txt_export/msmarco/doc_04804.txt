Inground vs. Above Ground Pool Costs. The biggest determining factor in the cost of your swimming pool will be whether you choose an inground or above ground option. On average, the cost of installing a new swimming pool runs between $14,961 and $21,649. However, that is more accurate for pools installed in-ground. Choosing a pool installed at the ground level won't require excavation, which keeps costs much lower.
