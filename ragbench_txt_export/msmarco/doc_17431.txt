Pre-heat oven to Convection Roast 400 degrees. Meanwhile, cover a pan with foil, and spray with a thin layer of canola spray. Place the chicken legs on the foil until the oven is preheated-about 15 minutes. When ready, put the pan in the oven and set your timer for 20 minutes. When time is up, change your heat to 325 degrees, then set timer for 10 minutes. When time is up, remove pan from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before eating
