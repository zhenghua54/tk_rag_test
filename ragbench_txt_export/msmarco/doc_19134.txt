Mt. Fuji is called Fuji-san in Japanese, written as 富士山, with 'san' = mountain. It is actually an active volcano, and is the most important peak symbolically in Japan. (People also call it Fuji-san to mean Mr. Fuji in a sense, because it's so familiar.). Some reasons for its importance: 1. Mt. Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan (3,776.24 m) and is known widely for it's very symetricaly shaped cone. It is also an active volcano, having erupted last in 1707-8. Fuji-san has also been the subject of much art in Japan, most notably Hokusai's 36 views of Mt. Fuji.
