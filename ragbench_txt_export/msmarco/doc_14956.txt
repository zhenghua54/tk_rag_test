Make your base components — spicy chicken, flavorful black beans and that irresistibly zippy rice — ahead of time, then refrigerate or freeze for pre-layered, ready-to-go burrito bowls you can microwave or reheat on the stovetop. Then top your warmed bowl with fresh tomato and/or corn salsa, sour cream and more. Bring the water, lime juice and lemon juice to a boil in a small (1 ½ to 2 quart) saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt and stir to dissolve, then stir in the rice. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook without stirring or uncovering the pot for about 20 minutes, until the rice is fluffy and has absorbed the liquid.
