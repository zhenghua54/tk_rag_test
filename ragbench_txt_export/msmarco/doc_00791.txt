Phonics on the Web Plural Nouns. A noun is a type of word which refers to a person, place, or thing. Nouns can be conjugated in either singular or plural form. A singular noun refers to just one person, place, or thing (for example, a bat or a ship). A plural noun refers to multiple people, places, or things (for example, bats or ships). The majority of English count nouns are regular and predictable in the spelling of the plural form 1.
