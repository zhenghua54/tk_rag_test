In computer system file names, a suffix is a convention for having one or more characters appended to a file name (usually separated from the file name with a dot) so that it can be distinguished from other files or grouped together with similar types of files. Different operating systems have different rules about how long the suffix part of a file name can be. DOS, Windows prior to Windows 95, and OS/2 prior to OS/2 Warp limit suffix names to a maximum of three characters.
