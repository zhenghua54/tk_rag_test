Semiotics is the study of sign action (semiosis). As such, it is a purely human endeavor. All life forms engage in semiosis, all use signs, only humans know they exist. Only humans engage in inquiry into semiosis, or sign activity. In fact, most semiosis is chemical (Sebeok, 1991). This makes Saussure's semiology a subdivision of semiotics, the study of that type of semiosis that is species-specifically human. A sign is not that which it represents; it only resembles, refers to, or is somehow associated with that which it represents.
