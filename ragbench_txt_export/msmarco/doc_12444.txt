Over time, increased uric acid levels in the blood may lead to deposits of urate crystals in and around the joints. These crystals can attract white blood cells, leading to severe, painful gout attacks and chronic arthritis. Uric acid also can deposit in the urinary tract, causing kidney stones. 1 Patients may need medications to lower their elevated blood uric acid levels that predispose to gout. 2  The goal is a uric acid level less than 6 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). 3  There are two types of medicine for gout. 4  For control of acute attacks of joint pain, there are NSAIDs, colchicine and corticosteroids.
