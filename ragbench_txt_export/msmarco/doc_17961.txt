If you want to hang something heavy-like a bookshelf or a mirror-onto drywall, by far the best way is to fasten it directly into the underlying wall studs. Use a stud finder or just tap the wall to find out where the studs are and screw directly into them. Unfortunately, in lots of cases that isn't possible-those studs never seem to be where you want to hang something-so luckily, you have some other options. However, in practice, you are better off to use a nail to make a starter hole. Although hey are designed to be self-tapping, the nail hole ensures you get them started exactly where you want them. The wide threads grab onto the wall and prevent the fastener from pulling out. Nylon toggle bolts.
