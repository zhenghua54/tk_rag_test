Quick Definition. Lean manufacturing is a comprehensive term referring to manufacturing methodologies based on maximizing value and minimizing waste in the manufacturing process. Lean manufacturing has evolved in North America from its beginnings in the Toyota Production System (TPS) in Japan. However lean redefines waste. Traditionally waste has been viewed as an object. It is very easy to envision a barrel of scrap and identify it as waste. In lean manufacturing the term waste actually refers not to the physical material but rather the relationship of the resource to the end customer.
