3. Multiply the total square footage to be heated by the heating factor. If you live in a 2,500 square foot home and a climate zone with a heating factor of 40 BTUs per square foot, you need a furnace with an output of 100,000 BTUs per hour. In warmer climates, you may need only 30 to 35 BTU per hour per square foot to heat your house adequately. In colder climates, you may need up to 50 to 60 BTU/h/ft 2. In general, the further from the equator you live, the greater the number of BTU/h/ft 2 you need, but weather patterns and geography modify this somewhat.
