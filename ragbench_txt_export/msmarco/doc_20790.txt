The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created on December 2, 1970, by executive order of President Richard Nixon to permit coordinated and effective government action on behalf of the environment.. For example, for fiscal year 1991, at the end of the Bush administration, the EPA's budget was just over $6.09 million. President Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal year 1999 was over $7.77 million, a 6 percent rise as compared to 1998.
