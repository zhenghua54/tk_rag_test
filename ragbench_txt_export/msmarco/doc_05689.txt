Akamiso is made from a light coloured miso â€“ one with a relatively high proportion of rice or barley to the amount of soy beans. Akamiso has been aged for up to three years, which is what gives it its dark red colour (as in pictures 1, 3 and 4, which are all examples of akamiso). WHAT TO DO WITH MISO. Traditionally miso was aged in wooden casks for a minimum of six months, but in many commercial varieties the process is accelerated. Other grains such as rice, barley, and buckwheat may be added and each of these provides different flavour characteristics.
