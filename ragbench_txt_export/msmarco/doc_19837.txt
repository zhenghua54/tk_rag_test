To cook a jacket potato in a microwave requires approx 4-5 minutes in an 800 microwave, but you need to make sure you turn the potato instead of leaving it in the same position for the complete cooking period. I normally finish it off in the oven to crisp the skin up. Source(s): personal. R M Â· 7 years ago.
