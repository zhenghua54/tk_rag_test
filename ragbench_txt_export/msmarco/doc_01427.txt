â€”Carole Rohrbach. A: The blooms are the flowers of the rhubarb. They usually appear on mature plants and should be removed immediately if you are growing the rhubarb for eating. The flower stalk should be cut back at the base of the plant. Q: This is the second year for my rhubarb plant and it has several blooms (looks like a cauliflower) with the stalks.
