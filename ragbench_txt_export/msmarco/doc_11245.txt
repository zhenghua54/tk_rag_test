All snakes should also have some under-tank heating. You need to be careful here: You don’t just stick a heating pad under the tank, turn it on, and ignore it. It needs to be small enough to provide heat to only part of the floor, under part of the hidey-home. The idea is to provide what is called a “heat gradient”. Let’s say, for example, that the ideal temperature for your snake is 30C. Another spot on the floor under the hidey-home should be a little warmer, at 31C, and still another should be 28C or 29C. Yet another section of the floor outside the hidey-hole, should be as cool as 22C-24C, and unheated.
