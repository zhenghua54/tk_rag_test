A pin prick or a cat scratch at worst. If a snake bites you and lets go quickly, it is no problem. Put the snake back in the cage, wash the wound off with water, put on some neosporin, and put a band aid over it, if you feel like it is necessary. I usually just rinse off the area I was bitten and get back to business as usual
