Primary Muscles. The primary muscles the plank works are the erector spinae, the rectus abdomimus and the transverse abdominus. The erector spinae is a large muscle that runs up the length of the back. It surrounds your spine and allows you to straighten your back and rotate side to side. The plank is one of the simplest and most effective abdominal exercises. In its most basic form, you brace yourself at the top of a pushup while contracting your core muscles. You can do multiple variations of the plank to create more challenge and target different parts of the core.
