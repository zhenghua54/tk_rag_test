20 – 50lbs: ———————– 3lbs – 6lbs – 9lbs. Over 50lbs: ———————- 4lbs – 8lbs -12lbs. You can lose more body fat eating protein & fat (don’t eat protein alone) than not eating AT ALL. To lose weight fast, eat all you want, but nothing but meat, eggs, healthy oils, mayo, butter & half an avocado a day (for added potassium). Keep the calories high & the fat percentage high, at least 65% of calories. Green vegetables & some cheese will continue weight loss but at a slower pace.
