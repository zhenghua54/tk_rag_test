60-Second Answer. You can usually respond to an interview question in 60 seconds or less. If the interviewer wants you to expound on your answer, he can ask a follow-up question or ask you to proceed with more details. Answers that are 60 seconds or less involve the interviewer because you don't have time to dominate the conversation; he must respond to your comments or ask new questions. Rehearsing answers to common interview questions can help you prepared so you don't get rattled and ramble too long about irrelevant details. A hiring manager will likely ask open-ended questions that don't have simple yes or no answers, so take time to answer them thoroughly.
