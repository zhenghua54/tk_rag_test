Juicy, sweet watermelon is truly a summer treat. Watermelons require a long, hot summer in order to reach maturity. In the areas with short summers, start watermelon seeds indoors and transplant outside after all danger of frost has passed. In areas with a long summer watermelon can be started right in the garden bed.
