Stool Analysis. Guide. A stool analysis is a series of tests done on a stool (feces) sample to help diagnose certain conditions affecting the digestive tract. These conditions can include infection (such as from parasites, viruses, or bacteria), poor nutrient absorption, or cancer. 1 Check for poor absorption of nutrients by the digestive tract (malabsorption syndrome). 2  For this test, all stool is collected over a 72-hour period and then checked for fat (and sometimes for meat fibers). 3  This test is called a 72-hour stool collection or quantitative fecal fat test.
