Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with self-government than with parliamentary accountability; hence the notion that Newfoundland gave up responsible government when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933.
