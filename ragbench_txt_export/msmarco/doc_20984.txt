Specialized Pricing. Typing services typically charge per page, word or hour. If youâ€™re charging per page or word, you will want to have a standard rate for typing without editing and a rate for typing services with editing; this is called leveling your prices. For example, you can charge $3 per page for your base rate and an additional $2 per page for editing. To see if you're charging similar to the competition and to make sure you're not overpriced, call or browse the website of other home-based typing services and see what they charge for their services.
