Customer service representatives handle customer complaints, process orders, and provide information about an organizationâ€™s products and services. Customer service representatives answer questions or requests from customers or the public. They typically answer incoming phone calls, but some also interact with customers face to face, by email, or live chat. The specific duties of customer service representatives vary depending on what kind of company they work for.
