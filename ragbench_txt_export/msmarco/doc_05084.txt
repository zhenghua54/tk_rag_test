Mitochondrial fusion is a process mediated by several large GTPases whose combined effects lead to the dynamic mitochondrial networks seen in many cell types. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles with the ability to fuse (fusion) and divide (fission), forming constantly changing tubular networks in most eukaryotic cells.
