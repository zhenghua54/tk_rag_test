Vasuki is known in Chinese and Japanese mythology as being one of the eight Great Naga Kings (八大龍王 Hachi Ryuu-ou), amongst Nanda (Nagaraja), Upananda, Sagara (Shakara), Takshaka, Balavan, Anavatapta and Utpala. Vasuki is also mentioned and used as a tightening rope in other Hindu scriptures, such as in each of the Itihasas (Ramayana and Mahabharata). In Buddhist mythology, Vasuki and the other Naga Kings appear in the audience for many of the Buddha 's sermons.
