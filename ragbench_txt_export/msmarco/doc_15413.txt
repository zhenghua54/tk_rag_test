Glycocalyx. Glycocalyx is a general term referring to extracellular polymeric material produced by some bacteria, epithelia and other cells. For instance, the slime on the outside of a fish is considered to be a glycocalyx. Most animal epithelial cells have a fuzzy coat called the glycocalyx on the external surface of its plasma membrane. This coating consists of several carbohydrate moieties of membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins, which serve as backbone molecules for support.
