Ways to use tidal power: Tides produce by ocean can be used in three different ways to get energy and generate electric power. First is its wave energy or kinetic energy that water gets due to movement of waves. This energy can power the turbine if waves rise to a chamber and force the air out from there. In this ways moving air can spin the turbine. Second is energy of tides that come into the shore. These tides can be trapped in a dam and electricity can be generated by operating dam as regular hydroelectric power plant. Third form is oceanâ€™s thermal energy.
