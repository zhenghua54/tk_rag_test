At first glance, the animals inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents may not seem so dissimilar to other deep-sea creatures. But in fact, they are unlike any other life on Earth. Instead of sunlight, vent life relies on hydrogen sulfide-more commonly known as rotten egg gas and toxic to most land-based life. Until recently, all life on Earth was believed to be dependent on the sun. But in the last 30 years, several new deep-sea ecosystems have been discovered that utilize an alternative source of energy. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents form as a result of volcanic activity on the ocean floor.
