Report Abuse. It all depends on the driving habbits. I work in a brake shop, and I've seen the last anywhere from 8000km to 150 000km. I had to do the brakes on my mothers 1996 Dodge Caravan, and 130 000km of city driving, first time the brakes were done. I've seen gm brakes completely gone on cars with 12,000 mi. I usually replace front pads @ 80,000, and rear shoes - 120,000 mi. But it's a Honda, and it's a stick shift. On my work truck, I have 40,000, and no signs of wear to pads. But it's a Toyota 4Runner, unfortunately they don't make them with stick, and I had no choice other than get it automatic. In other words, considering all the variables, your front brakes should last 30,000-40,000 miles, rear-about 20% longer
