UPDATED: CBS ‘ The Good Wife already went through a major reset at the beginning of the season when Alicia (Julianna Margulies) left Lockhart Gardner, finding herself locking horns with her former boss, friend (and on-and-off flame) Will Gardner (Josh Charles). Every week I can’t wait to get to my PVR to watch Good Wife. Tonight, I have no desire to watch it. First, Will leaving is a horrible blow to the show. Second, if he had to leave, I could have lived with it if he didn’t leave in a such a violent way.
