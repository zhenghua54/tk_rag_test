Costs to remove a standing or leaning tree. There are different prices for different trees that need to be removed. Small trees that are less than 25 feet in height, depending on the complexity, can cost a property owner anywhere from $150 to $500 per tree. Trees that are 25 feet to 75 feet tall can range from $200 to $1,000 to remove. Remember, the complexity of the job determines if the cost is higher or lower. Trees that are over 75 feet in height can cost upwards of $1500 each, depending on the complexity of the tree
