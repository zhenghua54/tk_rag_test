Costs of Associate’s Degree vs. Bachelor’s Degree. When choosing a college, some of the main concerns are the costs of the school and the program. Many people find associate’s degrees to be the more lucrative option in the short term because they cost less money and have a higher starting salary. Transfer associate’s degrees are typically designed to take the place of your first two-years of a bachelor’s degree program. Courses will be in general education, liberal arts, and sciences; so when your credits transfer to a four-year college, you’re able to focus only on courses related to your major.
