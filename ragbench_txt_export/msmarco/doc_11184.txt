It was only after years of highly publicized civil rights demonstrations, marches, and violence that American political leaders acted to enforce these rights. President Lyndon Johnson signs the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964. Behind him stands the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. (Wikimedia Commons). President John F. Kennedy proposed the initial civil rights act. Kennedy faced great personal and political conflicts over this legislation. The civil rights movement deeply affected American society. Among its most important achievements were two major civil rights laws passed by Congress. These laws ensured constitutional rights for African Americans and other minorities.
