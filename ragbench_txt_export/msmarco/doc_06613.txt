Location of the Hamstring Muscle Photo Credit indykb/iStock/Getty Images. The hamstring muscles run along the back of your thigh, from your pelvis to your lower leg. There are three hamstrings: the semimembranosus, semitendinosus and biceps femoris. Semimembranosus and Semitendinosus. Two of the hamstring muscles -- the semimembranosus and semitendinosus -- lie on the inner side of the back of your thigh. Both muscles originate from the sitting bone, or ischial tuberosity, on the back of the pelvis.
