Eventually, the bone will regain all of its original strength and will be completely healed. If the fracture is not severe, the healing time will take 3 to 6 weeks, provided that you rest. There is no magic way of getting a bone to heal, because the body will heal it on its own in due time. In the meantime, take it easy and get some rest. After a couple of weeks, you should begin to feel better.
