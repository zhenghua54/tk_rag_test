Rhubarb plants will occasionally send up seed stalks with flowers in the middle of the plants. These stalks may not grow on young plants but are common on plants that are 3-4 years old and older. Some varieties of rhubarb are more likely to flower than others. Victoria is known to be a prolific flowering variety. photo credit. When you remove the flow stalks be sure to remove the complete stalk. These stalks don't pull off as easily as the leave stalks do, so you may need to use a knife. Cut the flower stalk off cleanly as close to the main plant as possible.
