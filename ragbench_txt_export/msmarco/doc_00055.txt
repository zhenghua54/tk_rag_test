A Scribd bargain. When I get the daily sales newsletters and see what’s being offered for $1-3, my first step is to check Scribd. I’m always curious, for example, about a $3 cookbook. For $3, even if there’s only one recipe that I will reuse regularly, it’s worth the price. But if that cookbook is already in the Scribd library, I’ve already paid for it. If I’m paying $9 per month, it’s well worth it for me to add discounted cookbooks to my digital library and not buy them at $1-3 each. In the long run, with my easily-tempted book buying habits, this is saving me a bit of money. So for $9, you can get a library of Scribd audiobooks, which is a bit cheaper than the least expensive Audible plan, which start at more than $10 for most users.
