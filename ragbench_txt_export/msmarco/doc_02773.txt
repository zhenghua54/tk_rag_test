Acute pancreatitis is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas that occurs over a short period of time. In more than 80 percent of the cases, acute pancreatitis is caused by bile duct stones or heavy alcohol use. Other causes include medications and very rarely, infections, trauma, metabolic disorders, and surgery.
