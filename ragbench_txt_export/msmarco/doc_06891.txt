Twin Mattress. A twin mattress is the smallest possible mattress size, other than a crib-sized mattress. Twin mattress dimensions are approximately 38 inches wide by 75 inches long. Both twin and full sizes are approximately 75 inches long, which may be too short for some adults, especially men. Sometimes still called a double mattress, a full size mattress is 53 inches wide, which is just 15 inches wider than a twin size (single). That leaves each partner only 27 inches of personal space, or about the width of a crib.
