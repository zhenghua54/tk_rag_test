Though a positive pregnancy test result after a missed period is a sure sign of being pregnant, in many women, various signs may be indicated by the body even before they miss their menstrual cycle. This article will help you understand the pregnancy signs that occur before a missed period. Many times, an hCG test proves to be negative even if you are pregnant. This is because hCG enters the blood stream 8-10 days after fertilization (before a missed period). The detectable levels of hCG in urine occur only 1-2 weeks after missing your period.
