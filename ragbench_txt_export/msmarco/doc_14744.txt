If desired, place the plant outdoors in a sunny location in spring after nighttime temperatures are regularly above 55 degrees Fahrenheit. 3. Water the desert rose when its soil feels almost completely dry when you insert your finger into the soil. Water until moisture begins to drip from the bottom of the pot, indicating the soil is moistened throughout the plant's root zone.
