DNA contains deoxyribose nucleotides while RNA contains ribose nucleotides. DNA is more stable than RNA because of the reduction in reactive oxygen atoms. A 5-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) forms the central molecule in a nucleotide. RNA nucleotides are defined by the sugar ribose, and contain a slightly different set of nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. RNA molecules do not contain thymine. Unlike DNA, RNA is usually present in a single-stranded form.
