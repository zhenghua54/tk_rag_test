The normal age range when a child starts walking is 9 to 15 months, and most children start walking just after the age of one-between 13 to 14 months. So if your 14 month child cannot walk, but can crawl, sit, stand, there is no cause for concern. Some babies skip the crawling stage altogether, and may start walking when they are 16-17 months. Every child is unique, and develops differently.
