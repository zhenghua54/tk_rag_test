A Happening is a form of avant-garde art-a type of creative expression, closely associated with performance art, which itself has its roots in twentieth century theories of conceptual art, derived largely from demonstrations organized by exponents of Dada, such as Tristan Tzara (1896-1963). In Japan, Happenings as types of performance art, were exploited during the 1960s by the Gutai Group-the avant-garde art group founded by Jiro Yoshihara in Osaka in 1954.
