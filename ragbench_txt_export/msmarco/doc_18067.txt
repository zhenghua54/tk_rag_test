If you take a little bit of extra time to start by previewing and skimming--five to ten minutes for an essay, or twenty to sixty minutes for a book--you will save time in the long run and dramatically increase your comprehension at the very beginning of reading. First and last pages: Read the first page or two of the first chapter, and the last page or two of the last chapter. This will tell you more precisely what the book is about. Chapter beginnings and endings: Read the first and last paragraph of each chapter in the book.
