Spores are tiny single cells that are produced by fungi that have hyphae. They can be produced asexually by a process in which the tips of the hyphae form specially encased cells â€“ the spores. Some fungi also produce spores sexually. Two types of special cells called gametes are produced. One of each type unite to produce a new individual spore.
