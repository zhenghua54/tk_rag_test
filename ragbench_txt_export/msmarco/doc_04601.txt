Although broken ribs will eventually heal on their own in 1-2 months if you are relatively healthy, knowing how to treat them at home will significantly reduce your discomfort. In rare cases, fractured ribs puncture the lungs or damage other internal organs, which necessitates emergency medical treatment. Ad. A compression wrap may be needed short-term (a few days) for stabilization and pain / inflammation control, but the restricted breathing caused by the wrapping is not good for your condition if done long-term (a few weeks or more). 1  Do not attempt to bandage or wrap your broken ribs at home.
