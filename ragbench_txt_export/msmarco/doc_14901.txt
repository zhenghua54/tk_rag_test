You may want to bring something to occupy your time. If you are selected to serve on a trial as a sworn juror, the term of service will be the length of that trial. Trials vary in length, but generally last one to two weeks. If you are not selected to serve on a trial by the end of your first day at the courthouse, and the judge has not ordered you to return for another day of jury selection, you have completed your jury service.
