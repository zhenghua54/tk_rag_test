An MRI is a test that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the spine. In many cases, an MRI gives different information than an X-ray, an ultrasound, or a CT scan. An MRI also may show problems that cannot be seen with other imaging tests. In some cases, a contrast material may be used during the MRI to show certain parts of the body more clearly. The MRI can find changes in the spine and in other tissues. It also can find problems such as infection or a tumor.
