Titanium: compounds information. This section lists some binary compounds with halogens (known as halides), oxygen (known as oxides), hydrogen (known as hydrides), and some other compounds of titanium. For each compound, a formal oxidation number for titanium is given, but the usefulness of this number is limited for p-block elements in particular. Based upon that oxidation number, an electronic configuration is also given but note that for more exotic compounds you should view this as a guide only. The term hydride is used to indicate compounds of the type M x H y and not necessarily to indicate that any compounds listed behave as hydrides chemically.
