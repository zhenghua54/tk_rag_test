Preparation method. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Put each haddock fillet on a piece of aluminium foil or greaseproof paper. Top with a piece of butter and season with freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice. Bring the edges of the greaseproof paper together and fold to form a sealed parcel. Repeat the process with the remaining haddock, butter, freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice. Transfer the parcels to a baking tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
