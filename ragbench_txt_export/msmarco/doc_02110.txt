As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms— white phosphorus and red phosphorus —but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. Instead phosphorus-containing minerals are almost always present in their maximally oxidised state, as inorganic phosphate rocks. The first form of elemental phosphorus to be produced (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow upon exposure to oxygen – hence its name given from Greek mythology, φωσφόρος meaning light-bearer (Latin Lucifer), referring to the  Morning Star , the planet Venus (or Mercury).
