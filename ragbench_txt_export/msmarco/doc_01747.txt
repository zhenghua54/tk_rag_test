It is prepared by melting unsalted butter until the liquid turns honey color. We usually filter the residue and use the clear ghee in cooking. We usually discard the ghee residue which is dark in color. It is the burnt butter that remains in the bottom of the pan when preparing ghee. I have used this residue in making wheat laddu. Do not drain all of the ghee. Leave a couple of teaspoons of ghee. To this residue add wheat flour and keep stirring in reduced heat in the same pan, until the raw smell goes away from the wheat flour. To this add sugar and keep mixing.
