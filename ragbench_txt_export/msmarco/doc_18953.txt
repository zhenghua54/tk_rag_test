As a douche: Add 3 tablespoons raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar to 2 quarts warm purified (distilled water or filtered water that has been boiled and cooled to warm). Apple cider vinegar naturally has the same acidity as a healthy vagina. Use this cleansing douche for a natural remedy for vaginal yeast infections.
