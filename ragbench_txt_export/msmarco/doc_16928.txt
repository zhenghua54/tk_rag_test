However, your state law may be more generous if you have coverage with an insured plan. If your state lengthened the significant break from 63 days to, for instance, 120 days, then you can use your prior coverage from a previous job as creditable coverage. 1 For example, if you expect to have a 6-month interruption between jobs and health plans, you can purchase COBRA coverage during that time. 2  COBRA coverage can be counted as creditable coverage as long as there is no significant break after your COBRA coverage ends.
