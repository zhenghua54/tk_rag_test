The symbol 's' is so often used for displacement because the symbol 'd' is often chosen for distance. This is an important distinction in physic â€¦ s, where differences between scalar (distance) and vector (displacement) types are used to measure and describe different things. Whether s (or d) is used to indicate distance or displacement, the distinction is that a right-facing arrow is placed over the letter to indicate displacement since it is a vector quantity.
