Cervical lymphadenopathy is a sign or a symptom, not a diagnosis. The causes are varied, and may be inflammatory, degenerative, or neoplastic. In adults, healthy lymph nodes can be palpable (able to be felt), in the axilla, neck and groin. Similarly, the term lymphadenitis refers to inflammation of a lymph node, but often it is used as a synonym of lymphadenopathy. In this article, lymphadenopathy is defined as lymph node enlargement, and only causes of neck lumps related to lymph nodes are discussed, as there are many other causes of lumps in the neck.
