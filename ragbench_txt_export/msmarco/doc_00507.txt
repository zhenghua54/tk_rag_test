The Indian have known about the medicinal benefits of moringa tea since ancient times, using it to treat everything from headaches to depression. One historian writer states that Moringa tea has been used as a medicine in India for at least 4,000 years. Today, scientific research in both Asia and the west is providing hard evidence for the health benefits long associated with drinking moringa tea. The secret of moringa tea lies in the fact it is rich in catechin polyphenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a powerful anti-oxidant: besides inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, it kills cancer cells without harming healthy tissue.
