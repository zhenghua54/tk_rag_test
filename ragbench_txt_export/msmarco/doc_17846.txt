Arthrotomy. An arthrotomy is any surgical procedure that requires opening a joint. In the case of the elbow, arthrotomy is performed to relieve the persistent symptoms and pain resulting from a condition such as tennis elbow. Most people achieve a full recovery in three to six months after the arthrotomy. Physical therapy is a vital component to a complete recovery, helping to strengthen the muscles and tendons around the elbow and regain a normal range of motion for the joint.
