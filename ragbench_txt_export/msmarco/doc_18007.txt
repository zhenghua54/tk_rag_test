As a mineral name, quartz refers to a specific chemical compound (silicon dioxide, or silica, SiO2), having a specific crystalline form (hexagonal). There are other forms of silica which are either non-crystalline, or of a different crystalline form than quartz. It is found in most types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. Quartz is rather hard, 7 on the Mohâ€™s hardness scale, and has a glassy (vitreous) luster. When a crystal is broken, the fracture surface is curved, like a shell. This is referred to as conchoidal fracture; glass fractures in the same way.
