At the superior border of the pons, the basilar artery divides to form the two posterior cerebral arteries. Before the basilar artery divides, several other arteries arise from it. These include the anterior, inferior, and posterior cerebellar arteries as well as pontine branches. One exception to this pattern is alternating hemiplegia. This is a paralysis that can be caused by ischemic stroke and affects different structures on each side of the body. It results from a brain stem lesion that damages cranial nerve nuclei and one side of the pyramidal tract in the same area.
