babies grow quickly in the first couple months...newborn onsies don't last very long at all...believe me. My son went through then withint the first week or so. So I would start by getting a bunch of 0-3 months and 3-6 months. It can be difficult to determine how many you will need. I do have a couple of very light hats too. Then I have a few sleepers and outfits I've grabbed from kids swaps and second-hand stores for the 6-12 month window, but I am going to wait it out and see how many I'll need and how fast little man will grow.
