The spinal cord does not run through the lumbar spine (lower back). After the spinal cord stops in the lower thoracic spine, the nerve roots from the lumbar and sacral levels come off the bottom of the cord like a horse's tail (cauda equina) and exit the spine (view the spinal nerve roots with Figure 1). The spinal cord can be divided into segments according to the nerve roots that branch off of it. Nerves along the cord consists of 8 cervical nerves, 12 thoracic nerves, 5 lumbar nerves, 5 sacral nerves, and 1 coccygeal nerve. The nerve roots run through the bony canal, and at each level a pair of nerve roots exits from the spine. Article continues below. 1  Cervical spine nerve roots
