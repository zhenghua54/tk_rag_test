The Volstead Act. While it was the 18th Amendment that established Prohibition, it was the Volstead Act (passed on October 28, 1919) that clarified the law. The Volstead Act stated that beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors meant any beverage that was more than 0.5% alcohol by volume. Prohibition was a period of nearly fourteen years of U.S. history in which the manufacture, sale, and transportation of liquor was made illegal. It led to the first and only time an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was repealed. Dates: 1920 -- 1933. Also Known As: Noble Experiment.
