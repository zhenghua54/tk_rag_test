If you are unable to moisturise and seal your hair twice a day, try to do it at least once a day, preferably at night. As you progress on your hair journey, you may find that you only need to moisturise and seal once a day or once every two days. 2) Moisturise before sealing – Always apply the moisturiser to the hair before applying the oil over it to lock in the moisture. And no,….mixing the two together will not achieve the same result. If you apply the oil before the moisturiser you will lock out moisture, i.e. prevent the moisture from being absorbed.
