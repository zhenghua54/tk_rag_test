The lymph node is covered by a tough capsule, which is penetrated in multiple places by lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels attached to the outer rim of a lymph node (the side opposite the hilum) are called afferent lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels emerging from the hilum are called efferent lymphatic vessels. Each lymph node possesses many afferent vessels, but usually only one or two efferent vessels. The lymph flowing into a lymph node carries with it the bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, debris, and other potentially dangerous agents that have filtered into the lymphatic vessels from your bloodstream and tissues. Lymph enters a lymph node through an afferent lymphatic vessel.
