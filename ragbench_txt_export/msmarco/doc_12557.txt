More typically, junior senators of the majority party designated by the President pro tempore preside over the chamber. An exception to this pattern is when the Senate hears the impeachment trials of the President of the United States, in which the Chief Justice of the United States is the presiding officer. The Presiding Officer is a role, not an actual office; whoever is presiding at the time is the Presiding Officer.
