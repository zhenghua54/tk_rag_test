The word buff meaning  enthusiast  or expert (US English) derives from the colour buff, specifically from the buff-coloured uniform facings of 19th-century New York City volunteer firemen, who inspired partisan followers among particularly keen fire-watchers. Buff is the traditional colour of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. The U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry specifies a buff tincture for certain coats of arms.
