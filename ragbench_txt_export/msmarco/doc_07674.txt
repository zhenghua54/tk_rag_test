Energy substrates in the human body are either carbohydrates, fat or proteins. Protein degradation yields amino acid residues which can be converted to carbohydrates and used in energy production. Carbohydrates (sugars) and amino acids from proteins give approximately 4 kcal/gram dry weight when burned in the body. Fatty acids from adipose tissue or food give 9 kcal/gram. Energy production, that is ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi, can occur anaerobically (without the use of oxygen) or aerobically (using mitochondrial reactions and oxygen). These reactions, especially anaerobic metabolism, are quite rapid.
