If your salmon smells somewhat sour or anything like ammonia, it has gone bad and you need to toss it. Fresh salmon has a mild aroma, or one that smells similar to the sea. Cooked or canned salmon also smells somewhat neutral or mild, while smoked salmon has a pleasant, smoky aroma. Before serving your salmon, check to see if it is still edible by examining it thoroughly. Although the shelf life of cooked, canned or smoked salmon is longer than raw salmon, all types of salmon eventually expire.
