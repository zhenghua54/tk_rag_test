1 The outer surface of cells is often covered in a polysaccharide or protein material called glycocalyx. 2  Glycocalyx can be formed from protein, polysaccharides, polyalcohols or amino sugars. 3  Glycocalyx can function in attachment, protection from desiccation, and protection from attack by a hosts immune system. The general term for any network of polysaccharide or protein containing material extending outside of the cell is the glycocalyx. Many bacteria produce such a coating on the outside of their cell, and they come in two types: capsules and slime layers. The difference between the two is somewhat arbitrary.
