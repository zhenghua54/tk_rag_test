What are some of the advantages to nurse practitioner care? NPs are uniquely focused on “caring” as opposed to “curing.” NPs combine nursing education and experience with through education in medical care for their specialty area. They take the “whole person” into account, not just the immediate ailment. NPs provide patient-centered care.
