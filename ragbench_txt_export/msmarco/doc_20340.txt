The country with the second largest number, Canada, had just 1,396 locations. Only two other countries had more than one thousand Starbucks stores at this time, China and Japan. Surprisingly, the city with the largest number of Starbucks stores worldwide was found in none of the aforementioned countries. Seoul, in South Korea, had 284 locations as of May 2014. It seems that, for Starbucks, financial success has gone hand-in-hand with global expansion.
