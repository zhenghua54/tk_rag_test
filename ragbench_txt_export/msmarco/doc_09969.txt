Radiometric dating works best on igneous rocks, which are formed from the cooling of molten rock, or magma. As magma cools, radioactive parent isotopes are separated from previously formed daughter isotopes by the crystallization process. (The nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons.) For example, the element carbon, which always has six protons in its nucleus, has three isotopes: one with six neutrons in the nucleus, one with seven, and one with eight. Some isotopes are stable, but some are unstable or radioactive.
