Great male players have ranged from 5 feet, 6 inches to 6 feet, 2 inches tall, a build that includes an estimated 95 percent of the world's adult male population. Soccer players range between Messi and van der Sar in height and overall physique. An exception would be a tall, thin player such as Englishman Peter Crouch, a journeyman who has played on more than 10 teams. He stands at 6 feet, 7 inches, and weighs only 156 pounds.
