Then there is the white flower Mulan wears in her hair when she meets the matchmaker – the same flower she leaves behind when she goes to war. I’m not sure what kind of flower that’s suppose to be. I first considered lotus (since the lotus is such a reveled flower in Asia and gets often connected to the gods), but a lotus has more petals. A white cherry blossom would have exactly five petals, but they would be more round. Article by Swanpride posted over a year ago.

The most obvious one is the magnolia, since that’s the translation of the name Mulan.
