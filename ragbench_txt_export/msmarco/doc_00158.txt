Wrist Strain. Injury to the muscles or tendons of the wrist. Muscles, tendons and attached bones comprise units. These units stabilize the wrist and allow its motion. A strain occurs at the weakest part of a unit. Strains are of 3 types: 1  Mild (Grade I)- Slightly pulled muscle without tearing of muscle or tendon fibers. 1 Tendons and muscles of the forearm. 2  Bones at the wrist, where the muscles and tendons attach. 3  Soft tissue surrounding the strain, including nerves, periosteum (covering to bone), blood vessels and lymph vessels.
