All hydrangeas will bloom and grow well in morning sun and afternoon shade. This is especially true of the commonly grown Hydrangea macrophylla. Macrophylla hydrangeas are the blue and pink mopheads and lacecaps. The further north one lives the more sun hydrangeas need and can withstand. PeeGee hydrangeas actually need at least 5 hours of sun per day to bloom well. The Oakleaf hydrangeas will also grow in sun or shade, but the blooms last longer if they get a little afternoon shade in hot climates. The leaves on the Oakleaf hydrangeas will color up best in the fall if they receive some sun.
