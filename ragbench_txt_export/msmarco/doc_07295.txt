Its not how many years (months) the brakes last, its how many miles that determines how long they last. I have afriend that put about 100 000km on his car last year, he he's on his 4 set of pads, and second sets of rotors, and just put new calipers on. I've seen gm brakes completely gone on cars with 12,000 mi. I usually replace front pads @ 80,000, and rear shoes - 120,000 mi. But it's a Honda, and it's a stick shift. On my work truck, I have 40,000, and no signs of wear to pads. But it's a Toyota 4Runner, unfortunately they don't make them with stick, and I had no choice other than get it automatic. In other words, considering all the variables, your front brakes should last 30,000-40,000 miles, rear-about 20% longer
