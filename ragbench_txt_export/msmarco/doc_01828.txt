The accelerated possession procedure. The procedure is called accelerated because in most cases the Judge makes the order based on the paperwork, without the need for a court hearing. When the Judge does this will depend on how quickly he does his ‘box work’. This may vary depending on how busy the court is. However in my experience, assuming all goes well, you can expect to get the order back in the post about six to ten weeks after posting off the application.
