How long to cook chicken thighs really depends on the size of the thighs and the oven temperature, but if you use bone-in, skin on thighs and bake at 450 degrees F, they will reach 165 degrees F internal temperature and be ready in about 25-30 minutes. 1 Add the chicken and make sure that every piece is covered evenly. 2  Marinate in a fridge for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours or, better yet, overnight. 3  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. 4  Place the chicken and all of the marinade in a baking dish.
