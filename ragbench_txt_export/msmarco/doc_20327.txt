The Harvest. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game estimates that fishermen in the state earn over $1 billion in wages per year. The total harvest usually has a retail value in excess of $3 billion, meaning fishermen keep about one-third of the sale profits. In other instances, deck hands are paid a flat daily wage of between $50 and $100. The wages of deckhands are usually based on experience and job responsibilities. Career fishermen usually earn much more than new recruits.
