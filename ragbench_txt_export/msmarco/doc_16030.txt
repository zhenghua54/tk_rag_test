Aluminium production starts with the raw material bauxite. Bauxite is a mineral found mostly in a belt around the equator. Bauxite, containing 15-25 percent aluminium, is the only ore that is used for commercial extraction of aluminium today. The bauxite occurs mostly in the tropics, in horizontal layers normally beneath a few meters of overburden.
