Leafy Spurge. (Euphorbia esula). DESCRIPTION: Leafy spurge is a member of the euphorbiaceae family, and ranges 6 to 36 inches in height. Although the plant appears to be delicate, its strength is in its extensive root system. Erect stems support linear, alternate, and apetiolate leaves of a bluish-green hue. It is allelopathic, which means it emits chemicals from its roots that retard the growth or seed germination of other plants. Also, like other exotic invasive plants, it lacks the insects and fungi that preyed on it in its native land. There are a number of spurges that hybridize with leafy spurge.
