See, the chicken swallows food into its crop; from there it passes into the stomach where digestive enzymes are secreted, and mushed around. Then it passes into the gizzard, which is very muscular and may contain grit or stones to help break up the food. It gets mushed around some more. Then it may get passed back to the glandular stomach for some more digestive enzymes.
