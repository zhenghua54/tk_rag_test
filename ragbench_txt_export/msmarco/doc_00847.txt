Presented here are pages for your efforts to figure out what may be wrong with your Chooks. Notes: Theses pages cover ONLY the more common Poultry diseases. I have learned not to read too much into what your sick chicken presents when they are ill. Try not to look for exotic type diseases. Working quickly with a diagnosis can save your sick chicken.
