Aproxame â€¦ tly 1 year after the expiration date if it has an experation date im not sure im allergic to basicly ALL seafood sorry! Making the world better, one answer at a time. Most things frozen can last awhile, but....once you start to see lots of ice crystals on your frozen food, or places on the shrimp that might have dried out with some discoloration then it's probably freezer burnt and been in there too long. A couple months.....
