Example: You convert your traditional IRA, with a value of $20,000, to a Roth IRA, paying tax on the entire amount. Two years later, when you are under age 59½, you withdraw $5,000 from the Roth IRA, and the distribution comes from conversion money because you haven’t made any regular contributions to your Roth IRA. You convert this IRA to a Roth IRA, paying tax on $6,000. Two years later you make a regular contribution of $2,000 to a different Roth IRA. A year after that, you withdraw $3,000 from the conversion Roth IRA.
