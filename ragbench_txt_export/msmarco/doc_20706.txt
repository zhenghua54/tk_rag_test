Online Program. Fitness organizations, such as the International Sports Sciences Association, offer an online personal training program for those interested in becoming a personal trainer. The program can take from four to six weeks to complete. The time frame is an estimation based on the average time taken for past enrollees. First, obtain the course material from the fitness organization and then schedule to take a test at a testing center close by. This process can take about six to eight weeks depending on the individualâ€™s experience and knowledge, and the scheduling of the exam.
