You'll see a lot of your healthcare practitioner during your pregnancy â€“ that's why it's so important to choose someone you like and trust. Most pregnant women have between ten and 15 prenatal visits. If you have a partner or labor coach, you may want that person to come to some of these appointments with you. Typically, a mom-to-be will visit her doctor or midwife every four weeks during the first and second trimesters.
