Page 1/2 Boston Marathon 2015/2016. The Boston Marathon is the oldest annual city marathon in the world, appearing for the first time in 1897. In this first version of the Boston Marathon only 18 runners entered the race, but the number of participants has increased steadily since then. The largest field of runners so far was in 1996, when over 35,000 people finished the 100th Boston Marathon. The Boston Marathon is one of five members of the World Marathon Majors, consisting of marathons in Berlin, Chicago, London and New York, apart from the one in Boston.
