A babyâ€™s temperature is no different. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, normal body temperature for a health baby ranges between 97 degrees and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees to 38 degrees Celsius). A rectal temperature reading above this range indicates a fever. Contact your doctor immediately if your child is less than three months old and has a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or above. If your child is older than three months with a fever of 102.2 degrees, call the doctor to inquire if she should be seen.
