Also, this method does have a slight chance for injury to the rectum or of losing the thermometer into the rectum. Next best is oral temperature. To take an oral temperature, which is almost as reliable when done correctly, make sure the person has not had anything to eat or drink within the last 10 minutes. Have the person hold their arm firmly against their body for one minute, (or until thermometer beeps). *Add* one degree to an axillary temperature to make it accurate. Note: this is not very accurate in people who are extremely thin, or who have had their arms in the air for a period of time.
