Loan origination and discount points are both tax-deductible, as well as interest and property taxes. If loan origination points were high but you didn't pay other closing costs (e.g. escrow account setup fee, home appraisal and attorney fees, etc.), the loan origination fee is not tax deductible. To be tax deductible, it has to be clearly stated in points on top of the GFE and cannot pay for other items. If you obtained a mortgage to buy your primary residence, your loan origination points are tax-deductible for the year the purchase was made and only if the cash you contributed to the loan is greater than what you paid in origination points.
