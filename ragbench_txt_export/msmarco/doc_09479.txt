While Serotonin does not appear to be the main cause of a migraine, low levels have been linked to migraine headaches for a long time. A serotonin migraine is due to a deficiency in a person's serotonin level. During a Serotonin migraine, the levels of Serotonin in a person's system may rise and suddenly fall prior to the migraine. Low levels of serotonin are linked to both migraines and depression.
