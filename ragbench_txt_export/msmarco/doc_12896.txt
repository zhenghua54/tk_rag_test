Posture-Causes Tissue Creep Poor posture can lead to tissue creep. That is when the collagen fibres in the inner fabric of ligaments stretch and deform-similar to how plastic gives way under stress. Once this change has happened it difficult for the tissues to return to their normal length. Tissue creep may occur after long or repeated loading-it can start after as little as 15 minutes of slouching.
