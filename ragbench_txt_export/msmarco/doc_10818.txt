Concrete Resurfacing. Concrete resurfacing is a very popular project for homeowners, because it allows one to get a brand-new surface for a fraction of the cost of what new concrete would cost. The concept is not new, and it is gaining in popularity for commercial work and public highways. If the concrete resurfacing layer is thicker than 1 inch, you may also need some small rounded pea gravel for the mix.
