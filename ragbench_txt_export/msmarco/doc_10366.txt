Doctors in New Jersey must keep your medical records for seven years. After seven years, the law allows the doctor to destroy your records without any notice to you. In practice, most doctors will attempt to notify former patients by mail before they destroy medical records. Doctors may charge you no more than $1 per page or $100 for your entire medical record, whichever amount is less. If your record is fewer than 10 pages, the doctor is allowed to charge you $10. Doctors are also allowed to charge an administrative fee of no more than $10 or 10% of the copying cost, whichever is less.
