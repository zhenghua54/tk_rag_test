DNA is two stranded while RNA is usually one stranded. DNA uses a deoxyribose sugar while RNA uses a ribose sugar. DNA has the base thymine while RNA uses uracil in it's place â€¦ . RNA is catalytic, while DNA is only an information storage molecule. Three of the nitrogenous bases are the same for both RNA and DNA: guanine, adenine, and cytosine. Thymine, the fourth base pair found in DNA, is replaced by uracil in RNA. DNA has deoxyribose sugar while RNA has ribose sugar. The deoxyribose sugar has one less oxygen atom than the
