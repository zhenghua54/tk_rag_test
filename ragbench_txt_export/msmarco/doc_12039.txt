For looking up information on a specific phone number, the free reverse phone lookup allows you to see the name and address of phone numbers listed in the white pages of phone books throughout the US. The next three digits of a landline number or cellphone number are called the NXX. The NXX is also known as the prefix or exchange. Various telephone carriers will reserve blocks of telephone numbers by reserving an NXX within an area code. Like area codes, not all prefixes are currently in use.
