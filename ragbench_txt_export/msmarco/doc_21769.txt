Very few foods have vitamin D in them. Foods with a higher amount of vitamin D include fish, liver, and egg yolk. Excellent sources of vitamin D are foods and beverages that have vitamin D added to them. Cow milk always has added vitamin D. Orange juice, margarine, and soy beverage usually have it added. For other foods, check the label. You know vitamin D has been added if you see 'fortified' or 'enriched' on the label
