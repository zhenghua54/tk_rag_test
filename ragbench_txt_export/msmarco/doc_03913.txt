ALT is found mainly in the liver, but also in smaller amounts in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. ALT was formerly called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is done to: 1  Identify liver disease, especially cirrhosis and hepatitis caused by alcohol, drugs, or viruses. 2  Help check for liver damage. 3  Find out whether jaundice was caused by a blood disorder or liver disease. 4  Keep track of the effects of medicines that can damage the liver
