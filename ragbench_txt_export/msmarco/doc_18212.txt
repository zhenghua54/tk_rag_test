It is called Namenda. Namenda has helped with my Nerve Damage, and given me energy. I take about 15 to 20 mg every day at 6amâ€™ too help get me going by 9am. Considering I used to get going at 11am the earliest, this is a big improvement. It has also help with social anxiety, and I have clear thought processes. Hope this info helps
