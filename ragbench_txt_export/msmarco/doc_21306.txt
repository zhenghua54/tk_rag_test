A fraction is defined as the expression a/b, where a and b are integers. In the fraction a/b, a is the numerator and b is the denominator. Find the fraction of an integer. You can calculate the fraction of a whole number by multiplying the number by the numerator and dividing that product by the denominator. Thus, the fraction a/b of a whole number x is given by ax/b. Calculate the fractions of an integer for specific cases. For example, Â¾ of 21 is (3x21)/4 or 63/4
