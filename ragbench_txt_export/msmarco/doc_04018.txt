The sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun: the photosphere 's average temperature is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvin. The corona is 10 âˆ’12 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light.
