Starting antenatal care. You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with your midwife as soon as you know that you're pregnant. Your GP surgery or a Childrenâ€™s Centre can put you in touch with your nearest midwifery service. Although your first hospital antenatal appointment may not be until you are around 12 weeks pregnant, telling your GP and/or midwife promptly will help to make sure you receive maternity healthcare that takes into account all your health needs and preferences.
