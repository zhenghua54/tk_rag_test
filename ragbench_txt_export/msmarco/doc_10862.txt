A cracked chimney crown or spalling bricks can easily cost $1,000 to repair. And, if left untreated, the damage can accelerate quickly, and cost you upward of $3,000. It doesn't have to be that way. By simply sealing the bricks and the crown and adding a chimney cap, you'll greatly extend your chimney's life.
