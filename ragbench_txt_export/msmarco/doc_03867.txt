Saturated fats such as red meat, whole-fat dairy products, egg yolks and butter should not comprise more than 7 percent of your total daily calories, and your cholesterol intake should be less than 200mg per day. These changes combined can reduce your LDL between 11 and 15 percent, according to the NHLBI. They are also forms of soluble fiber; eating 5 to 10g daily can decrease your LDL between 3 and 5 percent in the first six weeks. Adding moderate physical activity, such as 30 minutes of walking each day, helps burn calories and improve cholesterol levels.
