In epidemiology, point prevalence is a measure of the proportion of people in a population who have a disease or condition at a particular time, such as a particular date. It is like a snap shot of the disease in time. It can be used for statistics on the occurrence of chronic diseases. Prevalence is contrasted with incidence, which is a measure of new cases arising in a population over a given period (month, year, etc.).
