Ribosomes: In Journey into the Cell, we looked at the structure of the two major types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Now we turn our attention to the protein assemblers of a eukaryotic cell, the ribosomes. Ribosomes are cell organelles that consist of RNA and proteins. Eukaryotic Cell Structures: Ribosomes are only one type of cell organelle. The following cell structures can also be found in a typical animal eukaryotic cell: 1  Centrioles-help to organize the assembly of microtubules. 2  Chromosomes-house cellular DNA. 3  Cilia and Flagella-aid in cellular locomotion.
