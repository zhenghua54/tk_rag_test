A strain energy density function or stored energy density function is a scalar valued function that relates the strain energy density of a material to the deformation gradient. In other words, the strain energy density function can be expressed uniquely in terms of the principal stretches or in terms of the invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor or right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor and we have:
