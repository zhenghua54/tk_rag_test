Now, if we just want an upper limit for the number of calories, we can easily calculate it because the highest density of calories within any food ingredient is 9 calories/gram. (Note that I’m using food calories .) So my 155 grams per slice means that there are no more than 1395 calories per slice of pizza. Before you panic and swear off Costco pizza, remember this is only an upper limit, a piece could have much less. And indeed, we’ll see with further analysis that it very, very likely does.
