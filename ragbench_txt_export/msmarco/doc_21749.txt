From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula TiO 2. When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6) , or CI 77891. Generally it is sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase. Titanium dioxide occurs in nature as the well-known minerals rutile, anatase and brookite, and additionally as two high pressure forms, a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form and an orthorhombic Î±-PbO2 -like form, both found recently at the Ries crater in Bavaria. It is mainly sourced from ilmenite ore.
