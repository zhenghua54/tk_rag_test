The term “founder” and “founders’ stock” are not legal terms, rather, they are terms of art describing a certain class of early participants of a company and their ownership interests. You will not find the terms “founder” or “founders’ stock” defined in the corporations code. Founders’ stock means the shares of common stock that are issued in the organizational minutes or consent of the board of directors of the company when they are setting up the new business, adopting bylaws and appointing officers.
