Molybdenum is also used in steel alloys for its high corrosion resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes further corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and especially so in the so-called super austenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a Mohs hardness of 5.5. It has a melting point of 2,623 °C (4,753 °F); of the naturally occurring elements, only tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and carbon have higher melting points.
