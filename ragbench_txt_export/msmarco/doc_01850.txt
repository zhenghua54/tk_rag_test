Climate: The obvious element of climate in the temperate rain forest is precipitation. At least 200 cm of it, perhaps up to 350 centimeters in warmer areas. The precipitation can fall in the form of rain or snow, with snow becoming more likely at higher elevations. This reduction in the number of species as one moves from the tropics to the poles is a global phenomenon, and is not restricted to the temperate rainforest; the temperate deciduous forest likewise has fewer species than a tropical forest, and the boreal forest and tundra biomes house fewer species still.
