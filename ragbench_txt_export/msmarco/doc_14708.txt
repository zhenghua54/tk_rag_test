Answer: Asteroids and meteoroids are important because they often contain material that has undergone little change since the solar system formed. In many cases, they contain the original material that formed the solar system. The surface material of the Earth and Moon, by contrast, has greatly changed over time. As we see them today, the asteroids would not make up much of a planet! A single body would have the following size. Use the formula for density: 317 (4/3)5103000 ï€½ R = 20,000 m or 20 km, so the diameter would be 40 km.
