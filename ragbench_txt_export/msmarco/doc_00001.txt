Sixty-nine people were shot dead on the island and another eight were killed when a bomb exploded in the government quarter in Oslo. Innocent victims: This picture was taken 24 hours before Anders Breivik launched a shooting rampage on Utoya island. At least nine of the youngsters shown here were killed.
