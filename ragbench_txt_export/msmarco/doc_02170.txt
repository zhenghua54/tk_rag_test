If a pair of TOMS is $54 as your example implies, it may cost TOMS $4 or $5 per pair MAX. This would be they could donate $4 or $5k not 27. There is no way those funds would help 13 other districts. Assuming their margin is 75%, a pair of shoes costs them $7, and the latrine is the equivalent cost of 286 pairs of shoes which could serve 3 communities of the size in your example. I get your argument – solve the underlying problem – but they still need shoes either way.
