The least expensive states for preschool-age care in a childcare center, with costs ranging from less than $4,000 a year ($333 a month) to around $7,000 a year are Mississippi, Kentucky, Louisiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Idaho, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Alabama. Nanny care costs significantly less in, say, St. Louis than in Manhattan simply because the cost of living is lower there and so are wages. And daycare – whether in a center or in someone's home – could cost double or triple per month in a relatively expensive city compared to a cheaper area.
