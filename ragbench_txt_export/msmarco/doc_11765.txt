The loop of Henle, lie in the medulla of the kidney, the other parts of the nephron lie outside of the medulla in the cortex. Salt is actively transported out of the filtrate, and since this area impermeable to water, water cannot follow the ions out here. The distal convoluted tubule, urine is then passed through here to the collecting duct where it is concentrated due to its permeability to water. It leaves the collecting duct into the pelvis of the kidney, which leads to the ureter and the bladder where it is stored.
