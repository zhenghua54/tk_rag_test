But this is not usually a problem in a man-made garden pond. If your pond water is green with algae it is probably healthy. You might not like the look – that is a different matter. In Japan, garden ponds are treasured and it is common to buy a dye to color the pond water. The use of the word ‘natural’ here refers to the pond filtration system, not the esthetic look of the pond. I’ll deal with esthetics in a future post on how to build ponds. In a natural pond the water, soil, plants, and animals all live in harmony. No one comes along to clean the pond or to aerate it.
