By Amtrak train, it takes about 8 hours to travel from Penn Station to Niagara Falls, including a ~20 minute stop in Albany and additional station stops. If you take the train, be sure to arrange for a rental car/taxi to meet you in either Buffalo or Niagara Falls, as the station is nowhere near downtown.
