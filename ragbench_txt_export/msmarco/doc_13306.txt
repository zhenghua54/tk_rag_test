If you are not quite able to perform a side plank on the elbow with good form, you can modify the exercise to strengthen many of the same muscles. Instead of extending your legs, bend your knees so your forearm and the side of one knee support your body weight. The side plank also works several other muscles that provide additional stability as you hold the position. These muscles include the gluteus maximus, the quadriceps on the front of your thighs and the hamstrings on the back of your thighs.
