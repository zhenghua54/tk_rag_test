Polyethylene terephthalate (aka. PET, PETE, PETG) is a plastic resin of the polyester family that is used to make beverage, food and other liquid containers, as well as for some other thermoforming applications. PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded or sheet extruded. It can be colored during processing. PETG can be semi-rigid to rigid, depending on its thickness, and it is very lightweight. The main virtue of PETG is that it is fully recyclable. Unlike other plastics, its polymer chains can be recovered for additional useIt makes a good gas and fair moisture barrier, as well as a good barrier to alcohol and solvents.
