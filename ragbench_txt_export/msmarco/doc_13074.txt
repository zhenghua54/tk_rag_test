Thymus. The thymus gland is the main organ of the lymphatic system. Located in the upper chest region, the primary function of this gland is to promote the development of specific cells of the immune system called T lymphocytes. The thymus gland acts to regulate the immune system through the development of immune cells responsible for cell mediated immunity. In addition to immune function, the thymus also produces hormones that promote growth and maturation.
