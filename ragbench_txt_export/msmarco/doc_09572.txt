The Royal Canin Feline Gastrointestinal High Energy dry cat food is great for helping kitties with short term or long term/chronic diarrhea, loose stools, or vomiting. It helps get the kitties gastrointestinal systems back on track. This particular product can be purchased from a veterinarian. My cat, Sierra, has been eating Royal Canin ever since I adopted her from the Petco Adoption Center (Silicon Valley Humane Society) when she was a kitten. This was the food brand they were giving her at the time and I didn’t question it. Now, she’s three years old, going on four this year.
