Granite countertops are among the most popular countertops in kitchens today. The average cost to install granite countertops is between $3,100 and $4,500, depending on surface size and materials. Generally, granite is cut into long slabs, negating the need for seams and grout. Then itâ€™s polished and sealed to protect against extreme heat, scratches and stains.
