The bird weighs 3-4 pounds fully grown. The male uses his big feet to build a nest for his mate. And what a nest it is! It measures as large as 50 feet wide and 20 feet high, made of decaying vegetation. Once the male has built the nest, the female tests the nest to see if it will be adequate for her eggs. When she accepts the nest, the female megapode starts to lay eggs deep in the vegetation, one egg every three days for up to seven months. Thatâ€™s 20 to 35 eggs total. Since the egg is the size of an ostrich egg, that is quite a workout for mom!
