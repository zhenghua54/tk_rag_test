A banner ad that costs $100 for 20,000 impressions has a CPM of $5, for example. By examining the costs to reach 1,000 customers for each marketing tactic you're considering, you can see at a glance which tactic costs more to reach the same number of people to help you decide where to invest your marketing dollars. CPM for magazine ads is calculated on the estimated circulation size of the magazine, which you can find in the magazine's media kit. Most provide audited figures, including the total number of readers broken down by subscribers and newsstand sales.
