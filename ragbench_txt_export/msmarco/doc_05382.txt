Bacterium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, the cause of TB. Credit: NIAID. Tuberculosis is caused by the infectious agent known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This rod-shaped bacterium, also called Koch's bacillus, was discovered by Dr. Robert Koch in 1882. This causes an Mtb infection. However, not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. The bacteria can remain dormant (asleep) for years and not cause any TB disease. This is called latent TB infection. People who have latent TB infection do not get sick and do not spread the bacteria to others.
