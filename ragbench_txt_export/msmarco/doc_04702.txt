Pillbug species of woodlice, such as Armadillidium species, curl up into a ball when threatened. The pill millipede, Glomeris marginata, behaves in a similar way and makes a convincing imitation of a pill-type of woodlouse. The pill millipede, however, has short antennae and 17-19 pairs of legs. Identification. Woodlice, also known as slaters and pillbugs, are terrestrial crustaceans. Their soft bodies are covered on the upper surface with a hard segmented shell, which is often grey but may be pinkish-brown, white, or mottled with white or yellow markings.
