Population: Except for the Riparian brush rabbit (subspecies riparius) which is state and federally listed as endangered (Williams et al. 2004), Sylvilagus bachmani is considered common where it is known to exist, throughout Oregon, California, and Baja California (Chapman and Ceballos 1990). This refuge has about 285 ha of habitat for brush rabbits. An additional few hundred hectares are actively being restored from cropland to natural, riparian vegetation. Refugia from flooding are also being established on the refuge for rabbits and other terrestrial wildlife (Hansen 2006).
