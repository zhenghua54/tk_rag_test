Poetic Devices. Poetic devices are literary techniques not exclusively limited to poetry. Poetic devices are used by good writers in all professions, from novelists, to journalists, to advertisers. This is because poetic devices are pleasing to hear. The use of poetic devices is separate from the study of poetic devices. For example, someone can have an advanced perception of what words sound good next to each other without knowing the technical terms applied to these techniques (perhaps you can think of a musician to whom this description might apply).
