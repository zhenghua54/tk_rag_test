Because coconut oil is used in beauty treatments and personal care, you'll sometimes find it sold alongside lotions and shampoos. Some of the coconut oil sold in these sections is actually safe to eat, but some is not. It all depends on how it was processed and how pure it is. Beware coconut oil products advertised as a hair or skincare oil. Heating an oil above its smoke point can produce dangerous byproducts, such as toxic fumes, free radicals and trans fatty acids. Do not worry if your coconut oil started out liquid and turns solid or vice versa -- both are safe to use in cooking and to eat.
