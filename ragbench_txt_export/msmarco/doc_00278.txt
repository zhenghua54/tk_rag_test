LSD is the abbreviation of the German words for lysergic acid diethylamide. It is the drug most commonly identified with the term hallucinogen and the most widely used in this class of drugs. It is considered the typical hallucinogen, and the characteristics of its action and effects apply to other hallucinogens. All LSD manufactured in this country is intended for illegal use, since LSD has no accepted medical use in the United States. Users of LSD typically feel some something within 30 to 90 minutes of ingestion, and the effects may last as long as 12 hours. Users refer to LSD hallucinogenic experiences as trips and to the negative ones as bad trips.. Most LSD trips include both pleasant and unpleasant aspects.
