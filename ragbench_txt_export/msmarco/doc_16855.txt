The Giza pyramids In the fourth dynasty, three large stone pyramids were built at Giza. The design of these pyramids was based on the pyramids that had been built before. These are the largest and sturdiest pyramids that were ever built in ancient Egypt. The first and largest pyramid was built for the pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops).
