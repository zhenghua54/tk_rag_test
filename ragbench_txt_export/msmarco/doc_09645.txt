The active ingredient in Dettol that confers its antiseptic property is chloroxylenol (C 8 H 9 ClO), an aromatic chemical compound. Chloroxylenol comprises 4.8% of Dettol's total admixture, with the rest made up by pine oil, isopropanol, castor oil, soap and water. Dettol is toxic to many animals, especially cats. Dettol contains the phenol chloroxylenol. Phenols are of particular concern because cats are unable to eliminate the toxins following ingestion. A cat may swallow the product by licking its paws after they have come into contact with it
