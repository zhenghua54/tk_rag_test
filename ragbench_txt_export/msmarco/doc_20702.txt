A personal trainer is a professional who assists the public in areas such as nutrition, exercise, goal setting, diets, lifestyle and more. It takes time to learn and develop the necessary education and skills needed to become a certified personal trainer. First, obtain the course material from the fitness organization and then schedule to take a test at a testing center close by. This process can take about six to eight weeks depending on the individualâ€™s experience and knowledge, and the scheduling of the exam.
