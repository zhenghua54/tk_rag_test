Mood swings and sudden behaviour changes often occur along with other conditions. With children, these are likely to be problems of attention, impulsive behaviour and high activity level. Children with developmental disorders may also frequently display sudden mood changes, which are related to their disability. Mood swings can first occur as early as 5 or 6 years of age, but they are rare in this age group. However, by adolescence, the likelihood of the more severe form of mood swings is much greater and similar to that of adults; as many as 1.6% of all adolescents may have severe mood swings.
