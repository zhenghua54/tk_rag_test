The ad hoc and infrastructure modes are used by wireless local area networks to connect devices to the networks. Although both modes allow computers and devices to connect to each other on a wireless network, infrastructure mode requires the use of an access point for this communication to take place. Although infrastructure mode is usually more useful than ad hoc mode, wireless access points lead to increased costs and more time for initially setting up the network.
