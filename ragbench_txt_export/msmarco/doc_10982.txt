ANS preganglionic neurons and somatic motor neurons derive from the embryonic neural tube. ANS structures found in the PNS (ganglionic neurons, adrenal medulla, and all autonomic ganglia) derive from the neural crest. Nerve growth factor is a protein secreted by target cells of the postganglionic axons. ACh is released by all ANS preganglionic axons and all parasympathetic postganglionic axons; these fibers are cholinergic fibers. Sympathetic postganglionic axons release NE and are adrenergic fibers (except sympathetic postganglionic fibers that synapse with eccrine sweat glands, these release ACh).
