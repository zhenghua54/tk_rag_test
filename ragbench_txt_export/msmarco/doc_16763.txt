DEFINITION of 'Mortgage'. A debt instrument, secured by the collateral of specified real estate property, that the borrower is obliged to pay back with a predetermined set of payments. In the case of a foreclosure, the bank may evict the home's tenants and sell the house, using the income from the sale to clear the mortgage debt. Mortgages come in many forms. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the borrower pays the same interest rate for the life of the loan.
