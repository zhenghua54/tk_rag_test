Let's put home inspection fees in perspective: If you're buying a $400,000 house and the inspection fee is $700, that's less than .2% of the cost of the house! Most real estate agencies charge 3% to 6% to sell a home, that would be $12,000 to $24,000 for a $400,000 house! There is no licensing in Nebraska. My charge for an inspection would be $300 - $500 for a single structure, depending on size. There is an additional charge for outbuildings and homes over 50 years old because of concerns over older electrical wiring and plumbing.
