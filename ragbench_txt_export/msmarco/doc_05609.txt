Strategic sourcing is an institutional procurement process that continuously improves and re-evaluates the purchasing activities of a company. As strategic sourcing is put in place and practiced over time, many large, sophisticated organizations will modify the process to better meet their individual corporate needs. Outsourcing a business practice to another company may also be incorporated into a sourcing strategy for services.
