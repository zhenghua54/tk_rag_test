The type of battery you use in your camera and the way you use it directly affects how long the battery will last. And of course, the way you use your camera can be quite different from the way your friends and family use theirs. NOTE: FOR ANY TYPE OF PHOTOGRAPHY: If you use a Kodak Li-Ion rechargeable battery for your digital camera, use the Kodak Li-Ion Rapid Charger or the camera dock to keep batteries continually charged. Kodak recommends storing the camera on its dock when not in use.
