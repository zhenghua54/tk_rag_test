By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. A fibroblast is a type of cell that is responsible for making the extracellular matrix and collagen. As well as being present as fibroblasts, these cells exist in an alternative state, as fibrocytes. Fibroblast is the term used to describe these cells when they are in an activated state. Fibrocyte refers to the less active state, when the cell is involved in tissue maintenance and metabolism.
