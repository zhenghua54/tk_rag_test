(Just multiply your calorie intake by 0.20 and 0.30.). Then, since 1 gram of fat contains 9 calories, just divide both of your answers by 9. The amount you get now is the ideal range for how many grams of fat you should eat each day. 1 Next, they’d figure out that 20-30% of 2500 calories is between 500-750 calories. 2  They’d then divide 500 and 750 by 9 (because there’s 9 calories per gram of fat) and get a range of 55-83. 3  So, in this example, this person would eat between 55-83 grams of fat per day.
