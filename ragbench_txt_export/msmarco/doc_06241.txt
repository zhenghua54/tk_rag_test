She is now 13 months old. I started teaching her sign language as a tiny baby (signing as I talked to her). She began doing the sign for 'potty' when she needed to be changed (about 5 1/2-6 months old). By 9 months she started signing 'potty' as she went & at 10 months she consistently signed before she went. She has been using a potty chair (or the small travel seat I bought for when we're out) for over 4 months. It is more work (on parents) to start when they are little, but she let me know when she was ready.
