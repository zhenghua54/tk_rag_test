Heart Arteries. When atherosclerosis occurs in the arteries of the heart, the most common symptom that can occur is chest pain, or angina. This pain is centered in the chest, and feels like a crushing or squeezing pain. People with angina typically have episodes of pain after exercise which goes away upon resting. This process of arterial stiffening is called arteriosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis in which fatty deposits called plaques build up in the arteries. The buildup of plaques can restrict blood flow through the arteries, causing disease in various parts of the body, including the heart and brain.
