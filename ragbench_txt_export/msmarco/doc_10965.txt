Sourdough starter begins with a combination of flour and liquid. The proportion and type of flour and liquid can vary dramatically, from a stiff starter made entirely with rye flour and water, to a liquid batter of milk and cornmeal, and everything in between. The result: sourdough starter. These tiny living creatures (lactobacilli and yeast, collectively called the sourdough's microflora) generate byproducts that cause bread to rise and give it complex, rich flavor.
