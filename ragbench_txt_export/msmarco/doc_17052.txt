A ccording to Genesis 3:24, God placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.. The s added to Cherubim in the King James version is redundant as the name Cherubim is plural for Cherub, a term derived from the Hebrew noun K'rubh.
