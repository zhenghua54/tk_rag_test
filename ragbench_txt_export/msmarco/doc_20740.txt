There are also three kinds of structures found in plant cells and not in animal cells. 1  cells have. ; 2  animal cells do not. 3  As noted in the description of the prokaryotic cell wall, the cell must also have a plasma membrane. 4  Plant cells have cell walls in addition to plasma membranes, not instead of plasma membranes. Eukaryotic cells, while very similar in function to prokaryotic cells, are much larger and more complex. They are typically characterized by the presense of a prominent, more or less central nucleus. Viewed through a light microscope, this nucleus is by far the most striking visible feature of the cell.
