The entire Strip from Mandalay Bay to Sahara Hotel is 3.8 miles. So it depends on how fast you walk. The Venetian is five minutes from Wynn/Encore. At least fifteen to MGM Grand. And probably ten minues to Bellagio and Paris, both on same corner. Walking depends on the weather and how many people are also out walking. But worth the walk to see the sights. Hey, don't forget City Center with Aria.
