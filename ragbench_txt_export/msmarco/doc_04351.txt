Update: Here is some information for you-A circular geosynchronous orbit in the plane of the Earth's equator has a radius of approximately approximately 35,786 km (22,236 statute miles) above mean sea level. A statute mile is 1,760 yards-or 5280 feet so to get to a geosynchronous orbit it would take a... Carbon nanotubes are strong enough with a tensile strength of 63 gigapascals. The idea would be to tether a very small asteroid at the top just a few kilometers PAST geo synchronous orbit to keep the space elevator cable under tension at all times.
