A dendrogram (from Greek dendro tree and gramma drawing) is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering. The distance between merged clusters is monotone increasing with the level of the merger: the height of each node in the plot is proportional to the value of the intergroup dissimilarity between its two daughters (the top nodes representing individual observations are all plotted at zero height).
