Subduction zones are sites of high rates of volcanism, earthquakes, and mountain building. Orogenesis, or mountain-building, occurs when large pieces of material on the subducting plate (such as island arcs) are pressed into the over-riding plate or when subhorizontal contraction occurs in the over-riding plate. Subduction zones dive down into the mantle beneath 55,000 kilometres of convergent plate margins (Lallemand, 1999), almost equal to the cumulative 60,000 kilometres of mid-ocean ridges.
