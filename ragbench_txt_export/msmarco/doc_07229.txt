Calorie expenditure relies more on your heart rate than the specific exercise. This allows you to use the same formula to calculate your calorie expenditure during any form of exercise. The formula is most accurate when you keep your heart rate between 90 and 150 beats per minute, or bpm. A heart monitor can record your average heart rate during exercise and the duration of that exercise session.
