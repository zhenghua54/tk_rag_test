The vertebrobasilar arterial system perfuses the medulla, cerebellum, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and occipital cortex. Occlusion of large vessels in this system usually leads to major disability or death. Vertebrobasilar stroke carries a mortality rate of more than 85%. Proximal to its bifurcation into the terminal branches (PCAs), the basilar artery gives off the superior cerebellar arteries that supply the lateral aspect of the pons and midbrain, as well as the superior surface of the cerebellum.
