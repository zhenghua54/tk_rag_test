Data Types. Variables are placeholders used to store values; they have names and data types. The data type of a variable determines how the bits representing those values are stored in the computer's memory. When you declare a variable, you can also supply a data type for it. All variables have a data type that determines what kind of data they can store. By default, if you don't supply a data type, the variable is given the Variant data type. The Variant data type is like a chameleon â€” it can represent many different data types in different situations.
