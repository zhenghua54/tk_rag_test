While fresh salmon is a good source of protein and is rich in healthy omega-3 fatty acids, spoiled salmon can make you sick if you eat it. Before serving your salmon, check to see if it is still edible by examining it thoroughly. Although the shelf life of cooked, canned or smoked salmon is longer than raw salmon, all types of salmon eventually expire.
