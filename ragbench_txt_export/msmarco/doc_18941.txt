First, weigh the cost of medical school. An AAMC fact card shows that the average medical school graduate owes more than $176,000, equaling a repayment of $328,000, assuming a three-year residency and standard 10-year payoff. Repayment, if extended, could cost upward of $400,000 or more, according to the AAMC example.
