Jaundice is a condition that can occur in newborns within 2-3 days of birth. Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. This is caused by elevated bilirubin levels in the newborn’s blood. Jaundice normally appears first on the face and then will move down the body to the chest, abdomen, arms, and legs. Bilirubin is a substance created by the normal breakdown of red blood cells. It is processed and removed by the liver. Jaundice will develop when a baby’s liver is not efficient enough to remove the bilirubin from the bloodstream.
