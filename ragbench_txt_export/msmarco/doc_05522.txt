A nurse practitioner (NP) is a registered nurse with advanced academic and clinical education and experience who are qualified to meet the majority of patients’ health care needs, such as managing most common and many chronic illnesses. NPs are uniquely focused on “caring” as opposed to “curing.” NPs combine nursing education and experience with through education in medical care for their specialty area. They take the “whole person” into account, not just the immediate ailment. NPs provide patient-centered care.
