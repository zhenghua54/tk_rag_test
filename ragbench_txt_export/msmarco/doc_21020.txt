Antibodies are specialized proteins that the body produces in response to invasion by a foreign substance. The process of anti â€¦ body formation begins when an antigen stimulates specialized lymphocytes, called B cells, into action. The white blood cells then produce antibodies to match the shape of the antigens.   The antigens on the surface of pathogenic cells are different from those on the surface of your own cells.
