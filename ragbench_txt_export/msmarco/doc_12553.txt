Joe Biden is the President pro-tempore, the Vice President, and the presiding officer for the senate. He's really more of a figurehead-he only acts if the President were to d â€¦ ie, in which case he would take over, or if Senate needed a tie-breaking vote (then he may act as that vote). 1 person found this useful. The day to day administration is actually delegated to the President Pro Tempore (at this time Daniel Inoye who is bestowed the duty because he is the longest serving Democratic member of the Senate).
