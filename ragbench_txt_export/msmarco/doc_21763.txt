The first recorded examples of Asian art are the Bhimbetka Petroglyphs (consisting of 10 cupules and an engraving or groove) discovered during the 1990s in a quartzite rock shelter (Auditorium cave) at Bhimbetka in central India. This rock art dates from at least 290,000 BCE. For more information about this period, please see: Aurignacian Art (40,000-25,000 BCE). Cave art: the earliest known example of parietal art is the El Castillo cave painting of a red-ochre dot/disk, dating to at least 39,000 BCE. Next comes two prehistoric abstract signs (claviforms) found among the Altamira cave paintings in Cantabria (c.34,000 BCE)
