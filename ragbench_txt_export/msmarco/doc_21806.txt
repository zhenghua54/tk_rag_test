DNA analysts often work in forensic crime labs where they examine samples of DNA to identify potential suspects. After conducting tests on each sample, analysts compare the identity of the sample with other known samples. To work in a crime lab approved by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), DNA analysts must meet the minimum requirement of a bachelor's degree related to molecular biology, genetics or forensic sciences.
