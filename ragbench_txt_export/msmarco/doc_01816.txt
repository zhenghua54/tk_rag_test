Bearded dragons can live over 20 years of age if they are properly taken care of but over 30 is kinda pushing it. Actually 20 years is really pushing it. Prior to the recent s â€¦ urge in breeding of dragons they lived about 12-15 years if well cared for. Due to the increase in breeding and inbreeding these days they will live for about 7-10 years if very well cared for.
