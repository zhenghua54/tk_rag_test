Direct grilling of boneless chicken thighs should take 15 to 20 minutes and grilling indirectly with the grill chamber temperature at 350 degrees should take 35 to 45 minutes. The time varies in accordance to the thickness of the chicken. 49 people found this useful. D â€¦ iscard excess marinade, bake chicken thighs at 400 degrees (or 425 for bbq effect) for about 30 minutes. (A bit longer if you prefer crispy grilled-like lool/taste.) BTW, these are excellent cooked on an actual grill.   While chicken is baking, prepare peaches.
