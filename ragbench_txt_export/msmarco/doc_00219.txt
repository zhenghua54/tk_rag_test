There is different types of squamous epithelium: simple and stratified. The function of simple squamous epithelium: It is good for the passage of materials via diffusion. For example, it forms the tiny air sacs of the lungs and the walls of capillaries. It also forms the smooth, friction-reducing interior lining of the heart, blood vessels, thoracic cavity, and abdominal cavity. The alveoli is just one cell layer thick so that diffusion of gasses between the capillaries and the alveoli is easy. Simple squamous epithelium are found in the capillary wal â€¦ ls and the alveolar walls. They are thin so diffusion is eas
