My family's average over the past year is about 650 kwh per month. We pay $0.097 USD per kwh in our area. Before I had made any changes (switching to CFLs, lowering the water heater temperature, upgrading to a new energy star fridge, etc...) we typically consumed 1000-1200 kwh per month. Tags: electricity, conservation. * The average residential monthly bill is $95.66 * Average residential monthly use is 920 kilowatt hours (kWh) * The average price paid per kWh is 10.4 cents, so about a dime.
