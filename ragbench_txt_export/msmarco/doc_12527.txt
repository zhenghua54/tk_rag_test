Transport of lipids into the circulation is also different from what occurs with sugars and amino acids. Instead of being absorbed directly into capillary blood, chylomicrons are transported first into the lymphatic vessel that penetrates into each villus. Chylomicron-rich lymph then drains into the system lymphatic system, which rapidly flows into blood. In order for the triglyceride to be absorbed, two processes must occur: 1  Large aggregates of dietary triglyceride, which are virtually insoluble in an aqueous environment, must be broken down physically and held in suspension-a process called emulsification.
