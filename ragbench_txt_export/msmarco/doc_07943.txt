As it is extremely sweet, Midori is not usually taken straight; it is generally used in a mixed drink (i.e., a cocktail), such as a Japanese slipper. It is usually used in a range of long drinks â€“ with lemonade, fresh lemon juice, lime juice, pineapple juice, or orange juice. Midori is a sweet, bright-green-coloured, muskmelon-flavored liqueur made by Suntory. It is manufactured in Japan, USA, Mexico, and France, although it was made exclusively in Japan until 1987.
