Drafting Fees: $125 per sheet. The cost then later for filing your non-provisional patent application would be an additional $1,500 in attorney fees plus $400 in a government fee. A non-refundable fee of $1,500 is required before we begin work on your provisional application. Consideration should also be given to a relatively new procedure which defers costs. Such procedure involves an initial filing of provisional patent application. Your cost would be $1,900 in attorney fees plus $65 in a government fee plus $250, if needed, as an estimated drafting fee for two sheets.
