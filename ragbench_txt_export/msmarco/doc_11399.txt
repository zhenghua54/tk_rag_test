For more severe infections, one 875-mg tablet every 12 hours or one 500-mg tablet every 8 hours may be recommended. It is important to note that two 250-mg Augmentin tablets are not equivalent to one 500-mg tablet (they contain the same amount of amoxicillin, but not the same amount of clavulanate potassium). Augmentin Doses for Adults and Larger Children. Children weighing 40 kg (88 pounds) or more are given the same dose as adults. The usual dosage is one 500-mg tablet of Augmentin every 12 hours or one 250-mg tablet every 8 hours.
