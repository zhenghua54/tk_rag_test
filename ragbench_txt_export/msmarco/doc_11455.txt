If you have a young rabbit how do you tell if its a dwarf rabbit?   You can try to evaluate it's final size by looking at his/her ears. The longest they are, the biggest the rabbit will be when adult. A dwarf-sized rabbit, when young, sh â€¦ ould have ears about 5 cm (2 inches) long or shorter.   The only real way to know if they are dwarf is by testing it's genome, because the term dwarf rabbit relates in fact to a gene called Dw, that dictates it's small size.
