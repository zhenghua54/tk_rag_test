It reacts with NaOH in a simple 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, thus making it an ideal substance to use to standardize a solution of NaOH. OBJECTIVES In this experiment, you will • Prepare an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to a target molar concentration. • Determine the concentration of your NaOH solution by titrating it with a solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate, abbreviated KHP, with an exact molar concentration. The process of determining the unknown’s concentration is called standardization. Solutions of sodium hydroxide are virtually impossible to prepare to a precise molar concentration because the substance is hygroscopic.
