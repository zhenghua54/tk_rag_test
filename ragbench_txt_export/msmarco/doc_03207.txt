Cephalexin may be used to treat a number of other bacterial infections. In addition, it can be substituted in place of penicillin to treat common infections in those people who are allergic to penicillin. Bacterial infections that cephalexin can treat are sinus infections, irritations of the prostate, and skin infections (like cellulitis).
