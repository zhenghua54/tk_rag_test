Thrombosis usually begins as an inflammation of the vein known as phlebitis * . Phlebitis develops when blood flows slowly or pools in veins. This usually occurs in the legs and causes injury to the walls of the vein. Just as platelets gather to form clots on cut fingers, they also may start to form clots along the injured walls of veins. The biggest danger is when a clot forms in the large veins that are deep within the legs. If the blood clot grows, it may break off. The clot may then travel toward and then through the heart and block the pul-monary * artery, which is a major blood vessel, causing a pulmonary embolism * .
