Your trip to Whidbey Island begins the moment your car stops on the ferry. The kids get to explore one of Washington’s icons, and there are plenty of interpretive signs on the vessel to help your kids (and you) understand the unique nature here. This $30 dollar year-long pass to all of Washington’s 100+ state parks is a great bargain. This parking pass means the whole family gets in for the one price. Otherwise, each park is $10 a day. Also, there are several county and city parks with beaches, and you can use them at no charge.
