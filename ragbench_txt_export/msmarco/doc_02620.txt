Today, the term amphioxus is still used as a common name for the Amphioxiformes, along with lancelet, especially in the English language. A non-technical review of all aspects of lancelet biology is: Stokes, M. D. and Holland, N. D. 1998. Lancelets are typically 5 centimetres (2.0 in) long, or 7 centimetres (2.8 in) at the longest. They have a translucent, somewhat fish-like body, but without any paired fins or other limbs. A relatively poorly developed tail fin is present, so they are not especially good swimmers.
