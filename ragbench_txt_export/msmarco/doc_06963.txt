Clairaudience, which means clear hearing, is the ability to perceive sounds or words from outside sources in the spirit world. The psychic ability of clairaudience is ruled by the throat chakra, which controls communication. When this chakra is balanced and open, it allows messages to be received. It is important to note that all the chakras need to be balanced in order for these abilities to function effectively.
