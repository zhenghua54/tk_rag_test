RNA serves as the template for translation of genes into proteins, transferring amino acids to the ribosome to form proteins, and also translating the transcript into proteins. Comparison with DNA Unlike DNA, RNA is almost always a single-stranded molecule and has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. RNA contains ribose, rather than the deoxyribose found in DNA (there is a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position whereas RNA has two hydroxyl groups). RNA has ribose sugars where DNA has DeoxyRibose. both DNA and RNA have Citosine, Adenine, Guanine in RNA, other nitrogen base is are urasil in DNA, other nitrogen base is are thiamine. above are the most obvious differences.
