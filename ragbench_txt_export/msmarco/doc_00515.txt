Since every planet has its own orbit around the Sun, and every orbit is a different length, all planets have different periods that would signify a year (or a complete orbit of the Sun). When Venus is in the middle of the Sun and Earth, it is at its closest point to Earth. During this period, Venus would be the closest planet to Earth. However, there are times when Mars is actually the closest planet. For example, during August 2003, Earth and Mars were at such a point in their orbits that Mars was at one of its closest distances to Earth. Asking which planet is the closest to Earth is actually something of a trick question â€“ the closest planet to Earth can change depending on the day, month, or even year. Rather than stating a time frame to describe when a given planet will be closest.
