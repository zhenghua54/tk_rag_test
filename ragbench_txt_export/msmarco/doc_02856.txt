A (fairly) normal uterine cavity and endometrial lining are necessary in order to conceive and maintain a pregnancy. There are several conditions related to the cavity or the lining that can cause problems. 1  When a woman has her menses (period) the endometrial lining of the uterus and some associated blood is shed. 1 Thin endometrial lining-this is also uncommon. 2  We like to see a lining of at least 8mm in thickness when measured by ultrasound at the time of maximal thickness during the cycle (see above ultrasound picture of an 11.2 mm lining).
