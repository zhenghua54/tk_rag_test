A missed period is the most common reason for women to take a pregnancy test. But some women experience pregnancy symptoms days before their period is due. As a result of the shift in hormones, tiny changes take place in the body that alert the woman that she may be pregnant even before a positive pregnancy test. Women who develop these symptoms before a missed period are, likely, very in tune with their body and are sensitive to even the tiniest hormonal changes. These very early pregnancy symptoms may occur up to a week before there are enough pregnancy hormones circulating in the body to give a positive pregnancy test result.
