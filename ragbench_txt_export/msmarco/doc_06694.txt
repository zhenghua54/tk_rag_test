Zaatar is traditionally eaten as part of a healthy breakfast and is ideal as an aperitif or hors d'oeuvre. A small piece of bread is first dipped into the olive oil and then into the thyme. Zaatar can also be used for cooking and is sprinkled over chicken, vegetables, salads and fish. In addition to importing the Jordanian exquisite range of Zait (Arabic for extra virgin olive oil), Terra Rossa also offers you a unique mix called Zaatar. Thyme is 'Zaatar' in Arabic. Thyme is most popularly used as one of the main ingredients in the spice mix named after it-Zaatar.
