Types. The are two types of molecular bonds: polar bonds and non-polar bonds. In polar bonds, the molecular bond is unevenly shared between atoms; in non-polar bonds, the electrons are evenly shared between the two atoms. In a coordinate covalent bond, a covalent, or molecular bond, is formed when only one of the two atoms is responsible for providing both electrons.
