Also, most colleges and universities require that you complete a college admissions exam (ACT or SAT) for admission. The baseline educational requirement to become a social worker is a Bachelor's degree, usually in Social Work or a related field. A four-year degree program is comprised of both coursework and a minimum number of hours (usually 400 for accredited programs) of supervised experience in the field. Because requirements vary by state, you should check with the Association of Social Work Boards to find what the licensing and testing procedures are for your state.
