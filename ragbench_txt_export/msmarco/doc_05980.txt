A positive blood test will usually show a positive result 3 to 4 days after implantation, or roughly 9 to 10 days after ovulation. For a home urine test, however, a positive result will not be visible until a week after implantation or until you have a missed period. You can’t assume you aren’t pregnant by a negative pregnancy test even when your period is already late. Either you need your period to arrive, get a positive pregnancy test or have a doctor perform an ultrasound to definitively know whether or not your are pregnant.
