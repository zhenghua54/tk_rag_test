1 A permanently fixed replacement for one or more teeth is known as a dental bridge. 2  A Maryland or resin-bonded bridge (with a false tooth and metal side wings that are bonded to the back of the adjacent/anchor teeth) can cost $1,000-$1,200 for one false tooth with two metal wings or $1,700-$3,500 with two false teeth. 1 It can cost $500-$1,500 or more per tooth for porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns; $600-$2,500 or more per tooth for gold or other metal alloys; and $800-$3,000 or more per tooth for all-porcelain.
