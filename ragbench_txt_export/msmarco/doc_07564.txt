Overview. Magnesium is an essential mineral that serves several functions in the body such as contraction of muscles, function of enzymes, protein production, energy production and energy transport. Magnesium aspartate is one of the most absorbable forms of magnesium. It is chelated, or attached, to aspartic acid, an amino acid present in protein rich foods. This helps the body absorb the magnesium. Magnesium aspartate is used in disease prevention, treatment and as a mineral supplement. Magnesium aspartate helps protect the heart by diminishing myocardial calcium uptake, which is responsible for cardiac hazards. Magnesium and potassium deficiencies are a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias.
