All puppies, no matter the breed lose their baby teeth from 3 to 4 months of age and they have generally lost all of them by the time they're 6 months old. The do lose their teeth with age. My neighbour had a cat (which has since passed away) that was around 16 years old-and only had two teeth. The rest had fallen out over time â€¦ .
