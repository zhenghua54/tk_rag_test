Responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments. It is not the same as a government with responsibility. A 'responsible government' is one in which there is a degree of accountability towards parliament. There is also the fundamental concept of Bicameralism. For example, in the United Kingdom the accountability tends towards the Lower House (House of Commons), as the upper House (House of Lords) is not wholly elected. In countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately. This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government. Some examples of countries that do not have a system of responsible government are the United States and France.
