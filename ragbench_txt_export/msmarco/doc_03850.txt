A name suffix, in the Western English-language naming tradition, follows a person's full name and provides additional information about the person. A generational suffix can be used informally (for disambiguation purposes, or as nicknames) and is often incorporated in legal documents. In the United States the most common name suffixes are senior and junior, which are written with a capital first letter (Jr. and Sr.) with or without an interceding comma.
