In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion. Watt's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered. The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained. James Watt, in 1781, patented steam engine that produced continued rotary motion and the power about 10 hp. It was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum.
