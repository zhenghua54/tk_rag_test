With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum. Once the three components are aligned, more natural movement may be restored.
