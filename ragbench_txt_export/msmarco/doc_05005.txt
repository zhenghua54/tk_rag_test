What is Bilateral Renal Parenchymal Disease. Renal parenchymal disease is not a single disease but a pathological state. Renal parenchyma is opposed to renal interstitium which is the tissues of supporting and connective functions. The kidney consists of renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. Renal parenchyma can be divided into renal medulla and renal cortex. Bilateral renal parenchymal disease means that the renal impairments are in the medullar and cortical areas affecting both the two kidneys.
