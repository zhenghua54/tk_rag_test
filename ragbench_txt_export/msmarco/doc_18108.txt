Feeding Baby Rabbits. Feeding baby rabbits falls mostly to the mother rabbit for the first 3 weeks of the bunny’s life. Between 3 weeks and around 6 weeks old, the baby rabbits need less and less of mom, and more and more pellets and hay. If you’re still nervous about the doe, just leave the nestbox outside the nest all day, and then put it back in with the doe about suppertime. The foster doe will do a much better job at feeding baby rabbits than you could, if you don’t overwhelm the new doe with a bazillion bunnies.
