The combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is an oral antibiotic widely used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate bacterial infections including sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, cellulitis and community acquired pneumonia. The combination consists of amoxicillin which is a semisynthetic, third generation penicillin and clavulanate which is a beta lactam that acts as an inhibitor of beta lactamase, the major bacterial enzyme responsible for penicillin resistance.
