Posts: 889. RE: how fast does a turkey' s beard grow? Maytom is right about the spurs tellin the age. a jake will have 1/2 or less spur length. a 2 year ole tom will have spurs up to one inch long. spurs longer than an inch, will be at least a 3 year old turkey. my personal belief is a tom with 1 1/8 spurs is a 3 year old. RE: how fast does a turkey' s beard grow? Totoe and Don are right on about the beards. Spurs are a better  age teller, but when they hit the 1 mark and a little beyond, it' s a toss up about the bird being a 3-4-5 year old!! Depending on which state you hunt, some spur length' s grow longer per age group.
