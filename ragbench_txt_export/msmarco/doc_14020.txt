1 For example, the Daniell galvanic cell 's copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode. 2  In a recharging battery, or an electrolytic cell performing electrolysis, the cathode is the negative terminal, from which current exits the device and returns to the external generator. 1 For example, reversing the current direction in a Daniell galvanic cell would produce an electrolytic cell, where the copper electrode is the positive terminal and the anode. 2  In a diode, the cathode is the negative terminal at the pointed end of the arrow symbol, where current flows out of the device.
