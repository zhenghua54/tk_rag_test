Trash. Although many apartments have an apartment complex trash can in which you can deposit your garbage, youâ€™re still likely to be billed for pickup. If your complex follows average utility costs, you could expect to pay between $10 and $40 a month for trash pickup. You have to consider the size of your apartment and the general climate. An average electric bill may be as low as $30 per month or as high as $100. Gas may cost, on average, anywhere from $40 to $150 and can fluctuate depending on the season.
