Peaches usually are not prone to serious insect problems. ‘Saturn’ peach trees are self-fertile; you’ll get plenty of fruit (twice as many peaches as other varieties) even if you plant only one tree. To get them at their best, your peaches should be ripe on the tree and measure about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Like other peaches, the ‘Saturn’ peach grows readily in most soils — just be sure to plant it in full sun. The tree usually will bear fruit in two to three years. Most of the nursery stock now offered for sale is grafted to dwarf roots, so your trees will not grow much more than 10 to 12 feet in height.
