The typical reflow temperature rangefor Pb-Free (Sn/Ag) solder is 240-250째C with 40-80seconds over 220째C.It should be noted that the recommended Sn/Pbreflow temperature range is less critical, and thatminor deviations in temperature of equipment andcomponents generally do not create solderingproblems. This makes it more difficult tooptimize the reflow process for all components onthe PCB.The PCB industry has extensive experiencereflowing components with Sn/Pb solders, whichtypically have peak reflow temperature of 215-245째Cwith 20-60 seconds above 183째C.
