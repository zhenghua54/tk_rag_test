A: Thank you for your question. Hair grows in cycles, typically every 4-6 weeks depending on the part of the body. Laser hair removal will only work on hair actively growing. So we recommend that it will take 4-6 treatments to effectively treat an area with our laser. We will get about 80% of the actively growing hairs. You would return every 4-6 weeks depending on the area to treat the new active growth.
