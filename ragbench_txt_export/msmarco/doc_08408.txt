Mechanical mistakes are those of orthography (spelling and capitalization) and punctuation. Everyone who writes in English makes such mistakes, whether native speaker or ESL student. In many cases mechanical errors are the consequence of quick writing where the focus is on the content rather than the form. Usage mistakes A usage mistake is a word or a string of words in a sentence that is grammatically possible*, but not usual in standard English. Hence native speakers rarely make usage mistakes, but ESL students very often do.
