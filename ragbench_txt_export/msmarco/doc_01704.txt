A new chest freezer with manual defrost and 18 cubic feet of space (1 cubic foot of space more than the upright freezer in section 1) consumes 432 kilowatt hours of electricity each year, or 10 percent less electricity than the smaller upright model. A new 17-cubic foot upright freezer with auto defrost uses an average of 684 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, explains Efficiency Vermont. A manual defrosting freezer uses just 480 kilowatt hours, which is about 22 percent less energy.
