I remember reading somewhere between $8,500-$15,000 a race in the sprint cup series depending on drivers....and sponsors. Start and park sell sponsorship cheap to get on their â€¦ car. Usually sponsorship on a start & park car is usually 10,000-20,000 a race. And a driver gets a good part of that too. So to answer your question alot. In the Nationwide series its between $1,000-$2,000 a race and trucks its 4900-$1,000 a race.
