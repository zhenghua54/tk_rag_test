Inulin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A single report of what is claimed to be an allergic reaction to inulin exists in the literature. About 30â€“40% of people in Central Europe suffer from fructose malabsorption. This is advantageous because inulin contains 25-35% of the food energy of carbohydrates (starch, sugar). In addition to being a versatile ingredient, inulin has many health benefits. It increases calcium absorption and possibly magnesium absorption, while promoting the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria.
