Serous Pericardium. Enclosed within the fibrous pericardium, the serous pericardium is itself divided into two layers – the outer parietal layer which lines the internal surface of the fibrous pericardium and the internal visceral layer which forms the outer layer of the heart (also known as the epicardium). The pericardium is made up of two main layers – a tough external layer known as the fibrous pericardium, and a thin, internal layer known as the serous pericardium (to overextend the orange metaphor, the outer peel could be thought of as the fibrous layer, with the inner white stuff being the serous layer).
