Fertilizer promotes healthy grass growth. When it comes to lawn maintenance, many factors determine how healthy, lush and green a lawn is. Lawns require regular mowing, water and fertilizer to keep them in pristine condition. When fertilizing a lawn, it is best to apply fertilizer after the lawn has been mowed so it has a few days to absorb the fertilizer. If you are using a rotary or drop spreader to spread 4 pounds of fertilizer over 1,000 square feet, set the blade to 3.5 if the spreader has a range from 1 to 10. Since many factors determine the setting for your spreader, check the fertilizer instructions to determine the blade setting if you are unsure.
