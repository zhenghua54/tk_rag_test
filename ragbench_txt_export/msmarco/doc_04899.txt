Prostate infection (prostatitis) occurs when your prostate and surrounding area become inflamed. There are several types of infection that can affect your prostate. Some men have no symptoms at all, while others report many, including intense pain. You are at increased risk of prostate infection if you use a catheter or have a medical procedure involving the urethra. Other risk factors include bladder obstruction or infection and some sexually transmitted diseases. Enlarged prostate or injury to the area can also encourage infection.
