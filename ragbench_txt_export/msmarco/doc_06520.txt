Indeed, I've driven past Damart's iconic chimney in Bingley many times on my way to and from the Dales and like me, Damart are celebrating their 60'th year. The product I was sent to review is a thermal top, a crew necked, long sleeved base layer made from Thermolactyl, a polyester based fabric. It is rated Grade 4 on the manufacturer's warmth scale, for use between -15C to -5C. Style and colour. In fact it's just about a perfect fit on me. My only gripe is that the sleeves are just a little on the short side. Laying the two products one on the other, the Damart appears about 1.5 to 2cms narrower in the body but is 1cm longer.
