To: Dr_Aparna. I needed the prednisone for poison sumac and called my doctor (she is my new PC) and she called in 7 20mg tablets to be taken 1 once a day for 7 days. Now I know by experience that they usually taper prednisone starting at the higher dose down to a lower dose and then stop. I recently got poison ivy, which I normally get once a year really bad and get the little punch pouch of of prednisone (6-5-4-3..). My medical insurance changed and now I need to get generic everything.
