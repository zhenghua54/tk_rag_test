The kittens,however will be born with alot of problems becouse their parents have the same blood. It would be like you having a baby with your brother/sister. Thats becouse cats have Pheremones. Pheremones are chemicals given off by your body that can attract or repulse a potential mate. Member 494894 answered on 1/12/08.
