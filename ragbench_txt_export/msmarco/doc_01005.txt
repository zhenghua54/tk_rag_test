Salivary glands produce saliva, which moistens the mouth to help a person chew and swallow food. Saliva also contains substances (enzymes) that begin the breakdown of food. There are four pairs of salivary glands: 1  The parotid glands are located between the ear and the jaw. 2  The submandibular glands are located under the jaw. 3  The sublingual glands are located on the floor of the mouth under the tongue. 4  The buccal glands are not shown in this picture.
