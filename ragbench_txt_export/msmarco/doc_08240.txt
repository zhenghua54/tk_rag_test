The Occupancy Fee/Tax is not imposed on the charge for the rental of a room in a hotel/motel for the purpose of assembly (e.g. a meeting, seminar, wedding, etc). The Municipal Occupancy Tax will be reported and paid to the Division of Taxation in the same manner as the State Occupancy Fee, which is reported on the HM-100.
