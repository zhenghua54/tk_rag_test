Boil boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 15 to 20 minutes. Thick chicken breasts will need about 20 minutes, while thinner, flatter pieces and smaller chicken breast halves will only need about 15 minutes. Cook skinless, boneless chicken tenderloins for 10 minutes or less. These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.
