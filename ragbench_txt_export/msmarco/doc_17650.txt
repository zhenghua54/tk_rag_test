Nurses were the first providers of anesthesia care and have continued to work in the field for more than 150 years. The designation of certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) first came into existence in the late 1950s as a mode of providing advanced training to the specialty of anesthesia nursing. Nurse anesthetists are required to have a Bachelor's of Science degree in nursing or other appropriate undergraduate degree and a master's degree from one of the more than 100 graduate schools of nurse anesthesia.
