In other words, relative risk is the ratio of two incidence rates. Prevalence is the proportion of the population that has a certain condition. Point prevalence adds the time frame to this definition, and it is the proportion of the population having the condition at a certain point of time. The critical point, alluded to by Azula R in the comments, is that the risk reflects incident cases, while prevalence reflects both new and existing cases. Thus prevalance is a function of incidence and duration of disease.
