Antibiotics also prevent UTIs. The doctor might prescribe preventive antibiotic therapy for: 1  Women who have recurrent UTIs (at least two UTIs in 6 months or three UTIs in 1 year). 2  Pregnant women who had recurrent UTIs before getting pregnant or during pregnancy. Antibiotics are effective for most UTIs. You should start to feel better within 1 to 2 days after starting antibiotics. If your symptoms get worse or you don't feel better by the third day, call your doctor. It is important to take all of the antibiotics your doctor has prescribed.
