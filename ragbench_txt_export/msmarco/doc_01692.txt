If you suffer from diabetes, after you have checked your blood glucose and treated the hypoglycemia wait between 15 to 20 minutes and check your blood glucose again. If your blood glucose is still low repeat the whole process-eat some glucose, wait about 15-20 minutes and check your blood glucose again. According to Medilexicon's medical dictionary, hypoglycemia is Symptoms resulting from low blood glucose (normal glucose range 60-100 mg/dL [3.3-5.6 mmol/L]), which are either autonomic or neuroglycopenic.
