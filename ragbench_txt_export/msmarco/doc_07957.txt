The type of material sofa one buys depends on a number of factors. A sofa’s upholstery should suit its surroundings and use. Sofas intended for everyday use should be covered in more durable fabric than sofas used in formal sitting rooms. Buying the right material sofa depends on a few factors, including the sofa’s use, whether one has small children and pets, and where the sofa will be placed. Everyday sofas need more durable upholstery, and pets and small children place added strain on fabrics.
