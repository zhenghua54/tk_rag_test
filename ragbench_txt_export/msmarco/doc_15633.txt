Human breast milk contains only small amounts of vitamin D. Vitamin D is stored mainly in the liver. Vitamin D 2 and D 3 are not active in the body. Both forms must be processed (metabolized) by the liver and kidneys into an active form called active vitamin D or calcitriol. This active form promotes absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestine. It is also the form used in high-dose supplements. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol): This form is the most active form of vitamin D. It is formed in the skin when the skin is exposed to direct sunlight. The most common food source is fortified foods, mainly cereals and dairy products.
