Dosage of Prozac for Depression or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The recommended starting Prozac dose for people with depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is 20 mg once daily. Your healthcare provider may choose to increase the amount if symptoms continue or decrease the dose if side effects occur. The maximum dose for these conditions is 80 mg per day. Amounts above 20 mg can be taken once a day or divided into two doses and taken twice a day. Prozac Weekly, the long-acting form approved for depression, can be used to replace daily doses of 20 mg.
