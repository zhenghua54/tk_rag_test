Body proportions. Arm-span versus height: The arm-span should be measured with the patient standing flat against a wall and the arms stretched out as far as possible. Normally the arm span is less than the height in boys up to 10 years of age and in girls up to 11 years of age. The arm span is approximately 5 cm greater than the height in adult males and 1.2 cm in adult females.
