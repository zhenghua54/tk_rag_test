The Lucas Valley community center and pool were also constructed by Eichler as a centerpiece of the neighborhood. In 1977, George Lucas purchased 1,267 acres (5.13 km 2) west of Marinwood, which he subsequently refashioned into Skywalker Ranch. The streets of lower Lucas Valley were named so their names all ended in berry.
