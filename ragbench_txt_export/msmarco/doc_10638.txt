A score below 40 mg per dL (1 mmol/L) for men, and 50 mg per dL (1.3 mmol/L) for women is known to be low. This places you at threat of cardiovascular problems. A normal HDL cholesterol is in between 40 and 49 mg per dL (1 and 1.3 mmol/L) for men. As for women, it is between 50 and 59 mg per dL (1.3 and 1.5 mmol/L). A result of under 200 mg per dL (5.2 mmol/L) is ideal. A level somewhere between 200 to 239 mg per dL (5.2 and 6.2 mmol/L) is within the edge line of high-risk class. In that case, your doctor might advise you to develop a preventing low cholesterol diet plan.
