The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is the UKâ€™s risk regulator formed in early 2011, charged with overseeing the stability of the financial system. The committee is given tough powers to tame systemic risk by clamping down on loose credit, overheated sectors and previously unregulated parts of the financial system. The committee, housed in the Bank of England (BoE) and chaired by the Bank's governor Mervyn King, is viewed as a counterpart to the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates. The FPC will be part of the BoE and staffed with six BoE executives, the head of the new regulator and four external members.
