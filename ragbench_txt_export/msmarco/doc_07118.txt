The lowest cost per square foot we saw was $4.17, for a 3600 sf building priced at $15,000. That price was almost certainly for delivery of the building components-not construction. On the other end of the scale, one buyer reported a total cost of $213,000 for a 9600 sf building, which works out to over $22 per square foot.
