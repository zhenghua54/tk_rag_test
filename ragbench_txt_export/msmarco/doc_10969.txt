The simplest definition of sourdough comes from the dictionary: leaven, especially fermented dough retained from one baking and used, rather than fresh yeast, to start the next. But sourdough is so much more than simply a way to make bread rise. It's an enticing, tangy flavor; a snapshot of American culinary history, and a classic ingredient in everything from pancakes to pretzels. The result: sourdough starter. These tiny living creatures (lactobacilli and yeast, collectively called the sourdough's microflora) generate byproducts that cause bread to rise and give it complex, rich flavor.
