Why? Because, for practical purposes, the NASCAR rule book assumes that every driver weighs at least 140 pounds. By rule, a Sprint Cup car must weigh 3,300 pounds. Where the weight of the driver is concerned, for every 10-pound increment below 180 pounds, 10 pounds of weight must be added to the car.
