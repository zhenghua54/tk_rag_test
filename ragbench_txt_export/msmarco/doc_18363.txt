1 The frequency of the recessive allele in the population. 2  Answer: We know from the above that q 2 is 1/2,500 or 0.0004. 3  Therefore, q is the square root, or 0.02. 4  That is the answer to our first question: the frequency of the cystic fibrosis (recessive) allele in the population is 0.02 (or 2%).
