The Reiki Distance Healing symbol Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen. (Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen is pronounced as: Hon-Sha-Zee-Show-Nen) The symbol has a general meaning of: No past, no present, no future or it can have the meaning of The Buddha in me contacts the Buddha in you. The Distance symbol can, as its name implies, be used to send energies over a distance. Time and distance is no problem when using this Reiki symbol. Many practitioners consider Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen as the most useful and powerful symbol. The use of the symbol gives access to the Akashic Records, the life records of each soul and can therefore be used in karmic healing. No problem, it is the intention of sending Reiki to this unknown person that makes it work. My advice is to let go of all you doubts, formulate a clear intention, use the Reiki symbols and send the energies! The form of the Distance symbols is complex and probably this is the symbol with most variations.
