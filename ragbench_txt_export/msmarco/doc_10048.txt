Everything always depends on the size of the house, the number of bathrooms and fixtures, and the quality of the products you want in it. plumbing could cost anywhere from 2500.00 to 100000.. you chose.. Average cost for a new home also depends on location. On AVERAGE for a 2000sf home, expect to pay about 9000, but if you live in a high demand area, this can go up quite a bit, as much as 30k in a few areas.
