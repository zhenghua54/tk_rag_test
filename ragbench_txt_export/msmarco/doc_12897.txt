Creep. “Connective tissues demonstrate properties of extensibility. The dense regular connective tissues are viscoelastic displaying both viscous and elastic rheologic properties with both time and frequency dependent properties.”. Wainwright SA, Biggs WD, Curry JD, Gosline JM. Mechanical design in organisms. “It was concluded that sustained static or cyclic loading of lumbar viscoelastic tissues may cause micro-damage in the collagen structure, which in turn reflexively elicit spasms in the multifidus as well as hyperexcitability early in the recovery when the majority of the creep recovers.
