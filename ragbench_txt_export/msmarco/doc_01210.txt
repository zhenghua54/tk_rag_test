Diastasis recti (also known as abdominal separation) is commonly defined as a gap of roughly 2.7 cm or greater between the two sides of the rectus abdominis muscle. This condition has no associated morbidity or mortality. 1 Diastasis recti is more common in premature and black newborns. 2  In pregnant or postpartum women, the condition is caused by the stretching of the rectus abdominis by the growing uterus.
