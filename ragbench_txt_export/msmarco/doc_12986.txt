As Alberta warns its citizens: Always make sure “supplementary health insurance or travel medical insurance will assist with the cost of ground or air ambulance services.”. It could cost an out-of-province traveller more than $700 for a ground ambulance in Nova Scotia, and in Ontario $240. The cost of an air ambulance could cost $2,700 an hour in British Columbia, and nearly $3,000 per hour in Quebec. Other provinces may have similar charges, but they are not generally disclosed on government websites. It will be much less expensive for medical insurance for travel within Canada than to another country. But, unlike the cost of an air ambulance membership card in Quebec, the price will vary by age and plan. One plan for travel within Canada would charge as little as 36 cents a day for a person aged 54 or younger, and about 3.5 times as much for someone age 65 to 69
