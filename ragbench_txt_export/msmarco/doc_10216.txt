For my healthy cats, I take them to the vet twice a year for an exam and, if necessary, vaccines. For my two cats with chronic health issues, I take them more often -- it usually winds up to be about 3-4 times a year. I would take them to the vet once a year, if nothing went wrong, for their rabies shot and a check-up. But something always goes wrong (or sometimes it's just me worrying), so it ends up a few times a year. And Dorothy has to get bloodwork done every 6 months, so she's twice a year minimum.
