Complex carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules that are strung together in long, complex chains. Complex carbohydrates are found in foods such as peas, beans, whole grains, and vegetables. The body turns both simple and complex carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar), but blood glucose levels rise slowly when complex carbohyrdrates are digested. Glucose is used in the cells of the body and in the brain. Any unused glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen for use later
