We had our house demolished. 3 bedroom brick veneer on a sloping block in Melbourne with carport. Asbestos in the eaves and also in the lining of the carport roof. Loads of vegetation to remove and a massive stump in the backyard. Cost was $14,500 all up. We had 5 quotes and all were in the ball park of that figure.
