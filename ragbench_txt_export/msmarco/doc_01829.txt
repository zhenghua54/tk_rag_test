This is not uncommon, and even at the end of a fixed term tenancy the landlord is still required by law to serve legal notice on the tenant requiring them to leave the property! In most cases if a tenant does not vacate the property the fastest way to evict a tenant is to obtain a court order for Accelerated Possession. The possession order will normally take effect two weeks after the decision unless the court decides that this would cause the tenant exceptional hardship. In that case, the judge may delay the order for up to six weeks.
