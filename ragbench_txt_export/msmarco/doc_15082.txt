1 House martins, song thrushes and blackbirds use mud in the construction of their nests. 2  A small, wet, muddy patch in your garden, such as a muddy puddle or edge of a pond, may make it easier for them to build a nest, particularly if it has been dry and there are no other nearby sources. Studies have shown long-tailed tits can use up to 2,000 feathers in each nest and in their effort to collect all the various materials, they will fly between 600-700 miles! Spidersâ€™ webs are an essential part of the design of these hanging nests and this just goes to show how closely linked birds and spiders are.
