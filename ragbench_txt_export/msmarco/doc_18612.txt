Anemia facts. 1  Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or hemoglobin is less than normal. 2  For men, anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin level of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml and in women as hemoglobin of less than 12.0 gram/100 ml. 1 Anemia is caused by either a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss (usually due to bleeding) or destruction of red blood cells. 2  Some patients with anemia have no symptoms.
