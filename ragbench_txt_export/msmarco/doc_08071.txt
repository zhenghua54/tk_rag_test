(Answer #2). When Paris first says he wants to marry Juliet, Lord Capulet (her father) specifically says woo her and indicates that his permission is only part of the deal and that Juliet has to agree too. Later, Paris asks again and Lord Capulet says Juliet should listen to his suggestion and marry Paris. That's in between. Juliet's parents did force her to marry Paris, Lord Capulet even threaten her that he would disown her if she doesn't. Of course though, Juliet faked her death, so she didn't have to marry Paris. And of course her plan lead to both her and Romeo' s death.
