HMO plans help with that. When you have an HMO plan, you choose a primary care physician who works as your partner. They coordinate all your care and refer you to trusted doctors and specialists in your network. Here's an example of how an HMO plan works. Alberto has BCN Advantage SM HMO ConnectedCare. Last weekend, he helped his son move. Another thing to know about HMO plans is that most health care isn't covered outside your network. That means if you're traveling outside your coverage area, we'll only cover emergency or urgent care in most cases. You have to live in Michigan for at least six months out of the year to get one of our HMO plans.
