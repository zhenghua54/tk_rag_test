Citrobacter is a genus of Gram-negative coliform bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family. The species C. amalonaticus, C. koseri, and C. freundii can use citrate as a sole carbon source. Citrobacter species are differentiated by their ability to convert tryptophan to indole, ferment lactose, and use malonate. Citrobacter shows the ability to accumulate uranium by building phosphate complexes.
