Another explanation for the wide range in the common cold incubation period is that some people never develop symptoms, even though an infection is present. This makes it hard for scientists to determine an exact common cold incubation period, but in most diseases, there is only a range, not an exact figure. In clinical trials rhinoviruses were introduced directly into the nasal passages of volunteers and 95% of them became infected.
