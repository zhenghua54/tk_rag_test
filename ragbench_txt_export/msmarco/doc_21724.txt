Make a list of the rooms in your house you would like to have cleaned and consider how long it would take you to clean those rooms yourself. Although a maid service may be faster, it is a good way to get a general estimate of the time and cost of hiring someone else to clean for you. This kind of service is normally used to prepare a home for viewing by potential buyers, post-construction clean-up, or for cleaning up extreme cases such as might be seen with a hoarder. It is a very involved service and can cost a bit. Whole house cleaning services are normally done on a one-time basis.
