Work Environment. L&D nurses work in hospitals as staff nurses on a labor and delivery or womenâ€™s health unit. Some facilities have one area for labor, delivery, and recovery and a separate unit for postpartum care. Others have an all-in-one area where patients go through the entire hospital stay in a single private room. Training. LPNs and RNs learn L&D on the job. Most degree programs have a class and/or clinical experiences in maternal and child health, but nursing students cannot choose a specialty as undergraduates and may only get a brief look into the field before they move to another area of study.
