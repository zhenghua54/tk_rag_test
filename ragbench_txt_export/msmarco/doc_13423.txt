I don’t think the avaaz defenders realise how much money could be made in a scam like this. Running a real .org that really sends on the petitions and really does everything they claim is a perfect cover for dishonest activity. Low cost, volunteer labour and a cheap web presence. Thanks for this information. I like the reply that Avaaz should organise a petition against spam !!!! I’m sorry guys, but it seems to me that avazz do such good work that your complaining about not getting a personal email & accusing them of being spamers themselves is a bit sad.
