Porcelain tile is harder to install than ceramic tile. Any well fired, dense, hard clay tile is more difficult to install than softer tiles not fired as long. Hard tiles are less porous and may, but do not always, require a special setting adhesive to bond well to whatever surface they are being installed on.
