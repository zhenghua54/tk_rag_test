Cooking. Sage is a common kitchen herb that is easy to grow and eat. The fresh or dried leaves are used in cooking. Sage has a strong, musky flavor and a pungent aroma. It is a good companion for fatty meats like duck and goose and is often used to flavor sausage. Sage is also an important ingredient in the stuffing used in traditional holiday turkey dinners. Bundles of dried sage leaves are used in the Native American smudging ceremony. This bundle, called a smudge stick, is lit on fire so that just the tip burns. The smoke rising from the stick is used to clear negative influences from an area.
