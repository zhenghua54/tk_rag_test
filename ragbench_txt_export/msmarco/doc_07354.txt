Aspartame has been used in the United States since the early 1980s. It is now found in thousands of different food products. Aspartame is commonly used as a tabletop sweetener, as a sweetener in prepared foods and beverages, and in recipes that do not require too much heating (since heat breaks down aspartame). Most studies in people have not found that aspartame use is linked to an increased risk of cancer. One early study suggested that an increased rate of brain tumors in the US during the 1980s might have been related to aspartame use.
