If the snake holds on, assuming it is a small species like the two kinds you mentioned, gently spritzing it with warm, not hot, water near its head and neck seems to work remarkably well. Whatever you do, avoid the knee-jerk reaction to pull your finger or whatever out of the snake's mouth. If a snake bites you and lets go quickly, it is no problem. Put the snake back in the cage, wash the wound off with water, put on some neosporin, and put a band aid over it, if you feel like it is necessary.
