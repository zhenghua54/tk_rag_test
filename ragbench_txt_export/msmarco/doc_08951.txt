Generally included in the installation price are the wax ring-which seals the toilet around the drain-new anchors and a new supply line. Installing a toilet can be a do-it-yourself project, but be aware that errors can cause floor damage, leaks and other problems that may require a call to a plumber. The price can fluctuate depending on several factors, including whether you want the plumber to haul away the old toilet, whether the toilet has special features and if important plumbing components are in good condition. Our research team found that a plumber usually requires an hour or two to install a toilet.
