In order for a crop to be certified organic it must be grown on a piece of land that has not had any non-organic materials applied to it for the past three years. Land that has started the process of becoming certified organic (has started only using organic materials) is considered to be transitional or in transition. It is an understatement to say that being certified organic has turned into a huge bureaucratic process. While the certification process does force organic farms to keep good records, it does not prevent the use of non-organic substances on organic products.
