Limit one pair of Blue-faced parrot finches per breeding enclosure, as these birds do not breed well in colony fashion. Because they prefer to nest in dense cover, Blue-faced parrot finches are unlikely to breed well in cages, and instead should be bred in large, densely planted aviaries. They do not tend to clump together on perches nor allo-preen, although young blue-faced parrot finches fostered by Society Finches may exhibit some of these behaviors. In the wild, these finches forage on the ground as well as among grass & low bushes, eating grass seeds, bamboo seeds, fig seeds, and termites.
