Chemo Cap. Loom knit a pretty chemo cap easily and quickly with this free pattern. The key here is the yarn. By having a bulky weight yarn the project can be finished a lot faster and the end result is a soft hat that breathes well and is warm without being itching. Also works well for people suffering any form of Alopecia. Cancer patients have a few unique needs when it comes to hats.
