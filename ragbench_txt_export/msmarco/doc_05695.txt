The standard length of a 35 mm film reel is 1,000 feet (305 m), which runs approximately 11 minutes for sound film (24 frames per second) and slightly longer at silent film speed (which may vary from approximately 16 to 22 frames per second). Most films have visible cues which mark the end of the reel. A 16 mm reel is 400 feet (122 m). It runs, at sound speed, approximately the same amount of time (11â€“12 minutes) as a 1,000-foot (305 m) 35 mm reel. A split reel is a motion picture film reel in two halves that, when assembled, hold a specific length of motion picture film that has been wound on a plastic core.
