Liver function tests or LFTs are blood tests designed to determine how well your liver is working. The concentrations of several liver enzymes in your blood, including alanine aminotransferase, serve as good indicators of liver damage. High levels of alanine aminotransferase usually indicate a damaged liver. However, low levels may also be problematic and should be further correlated with other clinical data.
