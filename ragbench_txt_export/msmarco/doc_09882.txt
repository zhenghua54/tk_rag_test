How to Become an Aerospace Engineer. A bachelor's degree is typically required to start out in aerospace engineering. Students who want to become an aerospace engineer should study physics, chemistry, and higher mathematics, such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. Certain universities also offer five-year programs in aerospace engineering. Students who complete these programs receive not only a bachelor's degree, but a master's degree as well. Engineers who hold a master's degree or higher are able to teach at universities and work on research and development projects.
