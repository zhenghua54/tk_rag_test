As the body’s ability to replace new bone tissue slows, the bones shrink slightly and become brittle, making them more likely to collapse and break — a condition known as osteoporosis. As well as the bones shrinking, height loss is also caused by the flattening of the discs that sit between the bones of the spine. Height loss at any age can be a warning sign of osteoporosis, particularly in women, but in men it also appears to be a marker for heart disease. But what many people won’t realise is that height is just one thing that shrinks with age: our hearts, facial bones and sex organs all shrink, too. Such changes often go hand in hand with health problems.
