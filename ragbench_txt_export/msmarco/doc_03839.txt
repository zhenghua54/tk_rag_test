Chemistry Lab Report on standardization of acid and bases. 1  1. Purpose: To prepare standardize solution of sodium hydroxide and to determine the concentration of unknown sulfuric acid solution. 2  Data and Calculations: This experiment is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). 1 PART A: Standardization of a Sodium Hydroxide solution NaOH Sample Code = O Trial 1 Mass of KHP transferred = 0.42 g Volume of Distilled water = 25 mL Volume of NaOH used = 22.50 mL Molar mass of KHP = 204.22 g/mol No. of moles of KHP = Mass of KHP used / Molar mass = 0.42 g / 204.22 g/mol = 0.0021 moles. 2  2.
