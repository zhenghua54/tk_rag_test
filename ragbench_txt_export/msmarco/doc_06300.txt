The average dog needs between 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce of water per pound of body weight in a given day. If your puppy weighs 20 pounds, for instance, heâ€™d need between 10 and 20 ounces of water for the day to stay hydrated. Most dogs will automatically hydrate to the correct amount, though some may over-or under drink.
