The divergence of a beam can be calculated if one knows the beam diameter at two separate points far from any focus (Di, Df), and the distance (l) between these points. The beam divergence, , is given by. Beam divergence is often used to characterize electromagnetic beams in the optical regime, for cases in which the aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the wavelength.
