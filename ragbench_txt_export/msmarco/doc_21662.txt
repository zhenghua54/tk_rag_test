Costs Vary Widely. Nationally, estimates of room addition costs vary from $80 to $250 a square foot. A simple room addition with a basic foundation and no plumbing generally costs at least $100 a square foot with typical internal finishing, no expansion of a heating/cooling unit, and minimal structural changes. The cost per square foot decreases as the size of the addition increases. Framing an addition averages $6 to $8 a square foot nationally. That's the cost of building walls and adding or extending a roof with rafters or trusses. It does not include drywall, doors or windows, insulation, finishing trim or utilities.
