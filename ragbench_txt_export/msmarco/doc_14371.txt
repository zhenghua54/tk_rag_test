Recessive allele: an allele that only has an effect on the phenotype when present in the homozygous state. Codominant alleles: pairs of alleles that both affect the phenotype when present in a heterozygote. Locus: the particular position on homologous chromosomes of a gene. Homozygous: having two identical alleles of a gene. Heterozygous: having two different alleles of a gene. Carrier: an individual that has one copy of a recessive allele that causes a genetic disease in individuals that are homozygous for this allele.
