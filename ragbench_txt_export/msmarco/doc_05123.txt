A “ covered call ” is an income-producing strategy where you sell, or “write”, call options against shares of stock you already own. Typically, you’ll sell one contract for every 100 shares of stock. In exchange for selling the call options, you collect an option premium. An example of a covered call in action. Imagine you already own 100 shares of XYZ. You bought them for $25 each, plus the commission of $4.95, and now XYZ is trading at $50 - but it doesn’t seem likely to rise much in the short-term.
