Course The course of Borderline Personality Disorder is quite variable. Borderline personality disorder is likely to remit (50% by 2 years, and 85% by 10 years), and once it remits, it usually does not relapse. Unfortunately, after 10 years, only about 20% have stable relationships or full-time employment.
