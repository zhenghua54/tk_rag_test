Beats Per Minute: Count the beats for 15 seconds and multiply this number by 4 to get your pulse per minute. Checking your pulse rates when resting, during exercises or after it, provides general information about your overall fitness level. Pulse rates vary from person to person. The normal pulse rate for humans is usually 60 to 100 beats per minute, however, there are certain medical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia which may alter the normal pulse rate of an individual. Other influencing factors include your age, gender and fitness level.
