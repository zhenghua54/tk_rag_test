Direct food additives are those that are added to a food for a specific purpose in that food. For example, xanthan gum -- used in salad dressings, chocolate milk, bakery fillings, puddings and other foods to add texture -- is a direct additive. Most direct additives are identified on the ingredient label of foods. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains a list of over 3000 ingredients in its data base Everything Added to Food in the United States, many of which we use at home every day (e.g., sugar, baking soda, salt, vanilla, yeast, spices and colors).
