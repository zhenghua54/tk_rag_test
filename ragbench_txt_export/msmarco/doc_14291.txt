PMI fees are generally expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. They can range from about 0.3% to 1.15% of the amount being borrowed. This is the amount you pay each year. (Example: a $300,000 home loan with an annual insurance rate of 0.5% would have $1,500 added onto it every year. But in most cases, a down payment below 20% brings the added cost of PMI. In 2014, the cost of private mortgage insurance ranges from 0.3% to 1.15% of the base loan amount, on average. This could increase your monthly payments anywhere from $50 to more than $100 a month
