The outer circle represents everything, while the black and white shapes within the circle represent the interaction of two energies, called yin (black) and yang (white), which cause everything to happen. The shape of the yin and yang sections of the symbol, actually gives you a sense of the continual movement of these two energies, yin to yang and yang to yin, causing everything to happen: just as things expand and contract, and temperature changes from hot to cold.
