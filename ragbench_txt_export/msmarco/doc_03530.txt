A thyroid uptake and scan, also known as a radioactive iodine uptake test (RAIU), is a nuclear medicine exam in which the patient receives an oral dose of a radioactive iodine that is absorbed by thyroid tissue. The amount of radioactivity taken up by the thyroid is measured and images of the thyroid are also obtained.
