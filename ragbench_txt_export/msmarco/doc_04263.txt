By Bill Granger. Also known as the tenderloin, this is the eye fillet that comes from within the loin. It's a lazy muscle and as such is lean and very tender, but with less flavour than other cuts such as leg or shoulder. Preparation. Pork fillet is very quick to cook but will soon dry out if overcooked. Remove any tough white membrane or sinew from the outside of the loin before cooking.
