Rock sediments are deposited at the bottom of a body of water, such  as a river or lake. When the flow of water changes direction, the  sediment has different momentum, so i … t does not change direction as  fast, and it will collide with the river bank and then settle. All forms of rock can weather and form sediment that is carried by water, wind or glaciers. Some just break down more easily than others. Example One is fine grained igneous b … asalt (lava) that is very difficult to break down.
