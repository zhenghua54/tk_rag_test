A concept closely related to the one of distance measures is that of divergence measures based on the idea of information-theoretic entropy first introduced in communication theory by Shannon (1948) and later by Wiener (1949) in Cybernetics. We also note here that a distance measure can always be considered as a divergence measure, however a divergence measure may not satisfy all the conditions of a distance given in (2.1) and thus may not be a distance measure. Such divergence measures will be referred to as pseudo-distance measures.
