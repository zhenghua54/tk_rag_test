So, if you’ve already got a whole watermelon in the fridge, you should keep it there. But if you’re storing it outside the fridge, put it in the fridge about three hours before you plan to eat it in order to cool it down to just the right temperature. I keep seeing everywhere an uncut melon will only last 7-10 days, but i have had this large 1-1.5 ft long watermelon sitting in my kitchen since early summer (maybe june to very early july).
