A DTaP booster is recommended for children ages 4 through 6 years old. Because our protection from tetanus decreases over time, older children need to get the Tdap vaccine. This booster shot contains a full dose of tetanus and lower doses of diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for all 11 through 18 year olds, preferably at age 11 or 12 years. After getting the Tdap vaccine as a preteen or teen, adults need to get a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to stay protected.
