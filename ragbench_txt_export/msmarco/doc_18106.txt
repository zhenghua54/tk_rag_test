Bunnies do not voluntarily leave the nest until around 4 â€“ 5 weeks old. One way to help protect a nest from a dog (or lawnmower) is to use a cheap, plastic lattice work style laundry basket that you can turn over and place on top of the nest. You will not see the mom. The mom will only come back in the middle of the night to feed her babies. If the mom was killed, the best thing you can do for a wild orphaned baby bunny is to get in touch with a skilled rehabilitator. In the meantime, call your local humane society or animal control and one of these vets for a wildlife referral: Rabbit Vets and Pet Bunny Vets
