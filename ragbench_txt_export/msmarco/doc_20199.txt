Range of motion (or ROM), is the linear or angular distance that a moving object may normally travel while properly attached to another. Devices to measure range of motion in the joints of the body include the goniometer and inclinometer which use a stationary arm, protractor, fulcrum, and movement arm to measure angle from axis of the joint.
