Hermeneutics is derived from the Greek word ἑρμηνεύω (hermeneuō, translate, interpret), from ἑρμηνεύς (hermeneus, translator, interpreter), of uncertain etymology (R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin). Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.
