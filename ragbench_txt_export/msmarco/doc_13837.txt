How can you tell what type of snake left behind a shed snake skin? This is very difficult for non-experts. I have found that most non-herpetologists have difficulty identifying a complete snake upon seeing it. But just the skin, it's even harder to identify what kind of snake shed a particular skin. All non-venomous North American snake results will be mailed out to you. Note: Do NOT ship snake bodies, carcasses or live snakes in the mail! Strolling into a copy store with a snake, is behavior we strongly discourage, as it may not be in your best interest. 1  Step 1: Place shed skin in a zip-lock or plastic bag.
