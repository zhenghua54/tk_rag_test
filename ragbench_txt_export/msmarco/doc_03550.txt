Growing to 15 feet high and 15 to 20 feet wide, Cherokee Braveâ„¢ has a rounded, naturally symmetrical shape that creates a fine canopy of shade in the garden. It thrives in full sun in cooler climates, preferring a bit of shade in warmer areas, and serves as an understory tree in hot climates. Even before the tree leafs out in spring, giant deep pink blooms (actually bracts) starred with a white eye cover its branches, each 3 to 4 inches wide and very showy. They last for many weeks, and are followed by bright red fruit that birds adore.
