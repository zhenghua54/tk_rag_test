Many GIS Specialists use desktop GIS software to analyze data and create maps for internal purposes. However, they're increasingly involved in launching and supporting online and mobile maps for public consumption. This type of work involves a solid background in computer science and programming. Employment of GIS specialists and cartographers is projected to grow 20 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is faster than average across all occupations. However, since it's a small field to start with, this growth will only create about 2,400 new jobs during that period.
