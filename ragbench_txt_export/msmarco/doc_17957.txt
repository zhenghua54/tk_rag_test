Molly fastener. A molly or molly bolt, often misspelled moly, is a formerly trademarked name for a specialized screw fastener used with drywall, as a hollow-wall anchor. Larger sizes permit reasonably heavy objects, such as shelving, flatscreen-TV mounts or central-heating radiators to be attached to drywall in locations where there is no stud behind the drywall. For heavy objects, multiple molly bolts may be required.
