Most calves are weaned between 120 and 290 days (3 to 10 months) after birth, but most producers like to wean their calves when they're around 205 (6 months) of age. Weight is also a factor, with the minimum being generally around 132lb (60kg). 1 This will only add to the stress of the calves during weaning time. 2  Beware of the likely reaction of the first-calf heifers. 3  They will crawl the fence if you do not make it escape proof with a couple of strands of hot electric wire or steel panels.
