To find out your state's statute of limitations, see our state by state listing below. If the time limit to sue on the old debt expired under your state's statute of limitations, that does not mean that a creditor or bill collector must stop contacting you about it. They can ask you to pay the debt. They just can't sue you (or threaten to sue you) for it.
