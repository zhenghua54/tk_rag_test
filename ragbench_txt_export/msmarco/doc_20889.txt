Financial managers usually start by earning a bachelor’s degree in finance, accounting, economics or business administration. Many also earn a master’s degree (in business administration, finance or economics) and continue getting financial management training, both on the job and off. Financial managers have the responsibility of overseeing the finances of major companies, agencies and everything in between. Along with their teams, they coordinate accounting and produce financial reports, cash-flow statements and profit projections.
