Plant spacing. Place a desert rose at least 2 feet from nearby plants-more if you can. Come in from a walk or driveway about 3 feet to allow for future growth and so that fallen blossoms don't make a mess on the pavement. These are superb as container plants, and the container can even be added to an eclectic garden bed. Even in summer, though, the plant is more stems and blooms than foliage. Slow growing desert rose can grow as much as 4 feet tall...but that takes quite a while. And a light spring pruning for fullness, shape and more flowers will keep the overall size much smaller.
