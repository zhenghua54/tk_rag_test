A chromosome mutation is an unpredictable change that occurs in a chromosome. These changes are most often brought on by problems that occur during meiosis (cell division process of gametes) or by mutagens (chemicals, radiation, etc.). A chromosome mutation that results in individuals with more than one haploid set of chromosomes in a cell is termed polyploidy. A haploid cell is a cell that contains one complete set of chromosomes. Our sex cells are considered haploid and contain 1 complete set of 23 chromosomes
