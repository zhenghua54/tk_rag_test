Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides are formed by three or more monosaccharides, for example Amylose (starch), Amylopectin, Glycogen (animal storage polymer), Cellulose, etc. AMYLOSE AND AMYLOPECTIN. Amylose, or starch, is a helical chain of Glucose monomers, which are bonded by glycosidic linkages (Alfa linkages 1 - 4).
