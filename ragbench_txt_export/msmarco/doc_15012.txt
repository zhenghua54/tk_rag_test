Ketosteril Treatment for Kidney Failure Patients. If you are now having kidney failure and your serum creatinine is high but you have not begun dialysis or you do not want to begin dialysis, ketosteril is a good non-dialysis treatment option for you. As has been mentioned above, ketosteril treatment needs to be combined with low-protein diets to consolidate the curative effects of ketosteril. Adult kidney failure patients should have no more than 40g protein everyday and it can be taken as long term treatment because ketosteril has very low toxicity to the kidneys.
