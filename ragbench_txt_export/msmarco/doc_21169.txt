---------------------------------------- Answer: About 3-4 days. I never have any problem with storing cooked rice in the fridge, but make sure its cooled and place in an airtight container. It never goes dry, hard or loses its flavor and I've been doing this for over 20yrs. Leave cooked rice uncovered until it's cooled slightly. Refrigerate in its cooking container and cover when cold. Next day, use a serving spoon to transfer to a freezer bag, separating the grains by applying pressure to the bag, squeezing out all the air and spinning the bag to twist closed.
