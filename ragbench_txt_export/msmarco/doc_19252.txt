Q: My animated train car does not work for my battery-operated train. A: If the animation does not work on your train set, turn the train car upside down and make sure that the wheels of your train car are making contact with the gears underneath the train car. If your engine still does not have power, check to make sure that the plug that goes from the tender to the engine is fully seated. Finally, make sure that the battery contacts in the tender car are clean of any debris or corrosion.
