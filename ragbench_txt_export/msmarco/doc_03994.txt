But......................there is always a BUT in the ABA............ but those teams went to another league. Most ABA teams won't pay anything. They don't have the money to answer the phone let alone pay the player. A good ABA team will actually pay the player......an average ABA team will fold. Posts: 1,066. Last year there were several ABA teams actually paying that much or more per week for some of their players. But, it looks like nearly all of those teams have either closed up shop or defected so I think that the $600/mo number moving forward might be accurate.
