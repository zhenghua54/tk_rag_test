The metallic bond is a unique type of chemical bond found in metal elements. In a sample of metal, the valence electrons detach from the atoms and are free to move throughout the metal. This results in a sea of electrons, or big pool of delocalized or valence electrons. The sea of electrons is negative and the metal atoms have become positive ions. The attraction between the two parts of the metal is the metallic bond. This special type of bond gives metals unique properties.
