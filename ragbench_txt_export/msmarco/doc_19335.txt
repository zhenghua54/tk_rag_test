Despite this winters in Florida are generally very pleasant. Even in Orlando, which is 400 kilometres north of the Florida Keys, daytime temperatures usually rise above 20°C most days during winter and will only fall below 10°C at night in January and February. In coastal areas especially on the east coast winters are particularly mild. In Florida you can get away with light clothing for most of the year, while some sort of protection from the rain is essential in summer. Unless you are only visiting the south of the state in winter you will need an extra layer for evenings.
