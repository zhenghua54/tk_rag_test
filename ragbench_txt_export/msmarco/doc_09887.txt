High School Prep Classes. The road to becoming an aerospace engineer ideally starts in high school. Potential engineers should focus on advanced math classes such as trigonometry and calculus. Additionally, an early background in physics, chemistry and biology will help soon-to-be aerospace engineers in college. One condition of licensure is completing a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). To become licensed, the aerospace engineer must show proof that he completed his education and pass a test administered by the state.
