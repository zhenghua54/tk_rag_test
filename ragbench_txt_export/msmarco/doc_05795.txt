CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) is a major international humanitarian agency delivering emergency relief and long-term international development projects. Founded in 1945, CARE is nonsectarian, impartial, and non-governmental. In 1993 CARE, to reflect its international organizational structure, changed the meaning of its acronym for a third time, adopting its current name the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere. CARE also marked its 50th anniversary in 1994.
