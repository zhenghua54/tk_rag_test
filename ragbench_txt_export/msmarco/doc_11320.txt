Adderall is a brand-name prescription stimulant medication used to treat inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and other symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including lack of focus, disorganization, forgetfulness, fidgeting, excessive talking, or frequent interrupting. Since the FDA has not studied the use of Adderall IR in children younger than three years of age, or of Adderall XR in children younger than six years of age, the FDA does not approve the use of Adderall XR in these younger age groups.
