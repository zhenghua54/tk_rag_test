Meats are kept better in the freezer. Meats can be kept in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days if raw and 1 to 2 days longer if cooked. Always place cooked meats in an airt â€¦ ight container. Leave cooked rice uncovered until it's cooled slightly. Refrigerate in its cooking container and cover when cold. Next day, use a serving spoon to transfer to a freezer bag, separating the grains by applying pressure to the bag, squeezing out all the air and spinning the bag to twist closed.
