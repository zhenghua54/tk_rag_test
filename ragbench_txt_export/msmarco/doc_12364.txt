Cut warm-season grasses when they reach heights of 2- to 2-Â½-inches. If the lawn grows too high for you to cut off one-third of the height and have an acceptable length, cut off one-third and then wait two or three days before cutting off another one-third. If you cut more than one-third, you will have: 1) clumps of clippings that lie on top of the lawn, 2) slower decomposition, and 3) a less attractive, bristly appearing lawn. If this occurs, rake and remove or use a leaf blower to obliterate the shavings.
