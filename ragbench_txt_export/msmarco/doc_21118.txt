Rock shrimp derives its name from the rock-like hardness of its shell and can easily be mistaken for a miniature lobster tail. Rock shrimp, which tastes like a lobster, is actually a member of the shrimp family. The texture of the rock shrimp leans toward the lobster, while the palate appeal is more like a shrimp. • Rock shrimp cook more quickly than other shrimp. • To boil: Drop in a pot of boiling salted water, stir, and after 35 seconds pour into a colander and rinse with cold water. • To broil: Place 4 inches from the source of heat for 2 minutes or until the meat turns opaque.
