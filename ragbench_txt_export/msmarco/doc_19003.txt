It is one of five الأحكام الخم سة (al-ahkam al-khamsah) — fard (compulsory), mustahabb (recommended), halal (allowed), makruh (disliked), haram (forbidden)—that define the morality of human action in Islam. Mubah is also used to mean permissible or allowed in Islam The foods addressed are mostly types of meat and animal tissue. The most common example of non-halal (or haraam) food is pork (pig meat). While pork is the only meat that cannot be eaten by all Muslims at all (the Quran forbids it), foods other than pork can also be haraam.
