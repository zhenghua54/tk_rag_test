Example: Jessie and Pat together earn $5,000 a month. Their total debt payments are $1,600 a month. Their debt-to-income ratio is 32 percent ($1,600 divided by $5,000). This ratio is one factor lenders use to decide whether a buyer can afford a mortgage payment. Generally, mortgage lenders prefer a debt-to-income ratio of 36 percent or less. In some situations, lenders will approve mortgages with higher debt-to-income ratios. Before you apply for a mortgage, make sure your credit is in good shape.
