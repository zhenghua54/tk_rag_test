RE: How many sleepers do I need? Everyone here is giving you good advice-you'll likely receive lots of 0-3 as gifts, and the weather will change by the time you need 6+ months, so you should probably focus your shopping on the 3-6 month size. I started dressing DS in that size at 2 months. You need to figure out how often you'll do laundry (I end up doing it about every other day) and how large your baby is (what size fits) and what brand/style of stuff you like (sleepers with feet, gowns, playsuits without feet, etc). I definitely liked (and still do) the one pc. outfits and sleepers for a baby.
