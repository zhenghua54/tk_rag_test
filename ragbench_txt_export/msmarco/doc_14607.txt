(2) Elongation of the mRNA chain. (3) Termination of the mRNA chain. The piece of mRNA that results from the direct transcription of the DNA that encodes a gene is called the primary transcript and it undergoes modification, sometimes quite extensively, before it can translate its message into protein. The class of enzymes that synthesize RNAs are known as RNA polymerases.
