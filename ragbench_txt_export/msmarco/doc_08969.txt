International flights usually have a 60 minute cutoff time. Once again this figure will vary by airlines. Since you'll most likely be checking luggage when flying internationally, it makes sense to get there at least 90 minutes early, depending on the airport and the time of year. 1 0 min if you're in a cab or being dropped off, up to 30 min if you need to wait for a shuttle bus and it's a large airport, with the shuttle stopping at all the other terminals first. 2  checking in and getting a boarding pass. 3  0 min if you did that at home.
