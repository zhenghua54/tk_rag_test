Many bacteria, including E. coli, contain plasmids that each contain an origin of replication. These are separate from the origins of replication that are used by the bacteria to copy their genome and often function very differently. The genome of E. coli consists of a single circular DNA molecule of approximately 4.6 x 10 6 nucleotide pairs. DNA replication typically begins at a single origin of replication. In E. coli, the origin of replication — oriC — consists of three A–T rich 13- mer repeats and four 9-mer repeats
