So about two years ago I started on a healthy hair journey. This included A LOT of things, but one of the most important things is to properly moisturize your hair. And in order to lock that moisture in, you want to seal it with an oil. If you’re wanting to take better care of your hair, you want to make sure you get a good moisturizer and some oils, and learn to measure exactly how much moisture your hair needs. And went over the places I put the moisturizer on. Recently, I’ve learned that I also need to moisturize and seal the ends of my hair. You want to do this to keep your ends properly moisturized and to prevent split ends. This used to be scary to me because I don’t want to weight my hair down.
