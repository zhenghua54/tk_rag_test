Common Causes of Vomiting. Here are some of the things which could be causing your dog or cat to vomit: • Diet Change: If you’ve recently changed your pet’s food, it could upset their digestive system. Although eating too quickly may be a one-off or a regular occurrence, it can lead to indigestion and vomiting. The best way to combat this is to feed small meals regularly throughout the day. Some breed-specific diets (eg Labradors) help slow their rate of ingestion. You could also try a scoff-stopper bowl.
