$100 for a male, $200 for a female if you can find a good vet who will do it. At least, that's what it is in my area. It is GREAT for their health, but it is pricey. They're great pets who enjoy the company of another rabbit. Rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age, so keep them separate until spayed & neutered. Female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85%, so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life.
