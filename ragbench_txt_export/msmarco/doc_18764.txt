The purity of street cocaine can be anywhere from 30-60%, probably less when amphetamines are involved. So, the average good price for decent coke in the Bay Area is about $45-65/gram, $120-180/ball and $16,000-21,000/key. Back on cutting, unless the dealer is your friend, they will tell you how good their coke is.
