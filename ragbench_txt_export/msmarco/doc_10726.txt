I continue to use silicone dielectric grease today. I use it as a lubricant on coaxial connector O-rings and threads. I use it to lube stainless bolts and nuts, to prevent galling. I use it for plug-in connections, in particular in my automotive hobby. Some complaints claim dielectric grease is conductive or abrasive, containing silica that increases wear. (It doesn't contain silica). The most frequent Internet complaint is that dielectric grease insulates connections, making connections less conductive. The general basis for this claim is in the word dielectric used in the name. The word dielectric is assumed to mean the connection will have future problems because dielectrics are insulators
