What is Diaphragm Function and Definition. Diaphragm-the thin, flat MUSCLE that forms the floor of the thoracic cavity (chest) , establishing a physical barrier between the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity. Small openings in the diaphragm allow structures such as the AORTA, inferior VENA CAVA, and ESOPHAGUS to pass through. Contraction of the diaphragm tightens this dome, pulling it downward to expand the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm has two equal halves, each called a hemidiaphragm, and is the primary muscle of BREATHING.
