Best Answer: Hoof Oil or Conditioner as I call it is like lotion to your skin. It helps moisten and the 'repair' the hooves. Like if you keep your horse in a dry pasture, putting it on once or twice a week could help keep the hooves moist and crack-resistant. Hoof oil moisturizes the hooves, giving them their natural flex back and helps prevent cracking and chipping. Hoof oil is not a replacement for proper diet and nutrition which is what could be causing the problems with the horse's feet.
