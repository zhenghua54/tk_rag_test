Terrazzo. Terrazzo is a type of agglomerate flooring and should be treated as marble in a maintenance program. Terrazzo is a composite material poured in place or precast, which is used for floor and all treatments. It consists of marble, quartz, granite, glass or other suitable chips, sprinkled or unsprinkled, and poured with a binder that is cementitious, chemical (such as epoxy or acrylic) or a combination of both. Divider strips are used to create panels for terrazzo floor when using different colors of cement and stones. These divider strips can be made of zinc, brass, alloy or even wood. After the terrazzo floor is poured into the divider strips, it is then grinded using stone or diamond abrasives.
