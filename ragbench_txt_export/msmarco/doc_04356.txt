In this model, the structural components of memory consist of what is called a “sensory store” (where data picked up by your senses is temporarily stored), short-term memory, and long-term memory. Information is first acquired through the senses, where it then enters the short-term memory store. Working memory (which could also be called “memory for now”) contains all that we are conscious of and working on right now. Information is held long enough to make a decision and then either is lost or sent on to storage for later use. If it’s transferred to form a memory for later use, it becomes long-term memory.
