It is important to treat epilepsy for several reasons. Untreated epilepsy places children at increased risk of accidents, such as drowning, head injury from a fall, or choking. Frequent seizures may create both social and academic disadvantages for children. Most seizures do not cause brain damage. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult to control generalized seizures. Sometimes a child having this kind of seizure will need intensive care to prevent brain damage or death.
