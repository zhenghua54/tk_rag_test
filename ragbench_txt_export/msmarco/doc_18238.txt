The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors-three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition. Some realised it could be their last chance to see this kind of art in Germany, while others endorsed Hitler's views. Many people also came because of the air of scandal around the show-and it wasn't just Nazi sympathisers who found the art off-putting.
