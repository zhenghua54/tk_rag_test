The data confirms it: there is a very strong exponential correlation in space/cost ratio (r=0.9916). Over the last 30 years, space per unit cost has doubled roughly every 14 months (increasing by an order of magnitude every 48 months). The regression equation is given by: Several terabyte+ drives have recently broken the $0.10/gigabyte barrier, making the next milestone $0.01/gigabyte, or $10/terabyte.
