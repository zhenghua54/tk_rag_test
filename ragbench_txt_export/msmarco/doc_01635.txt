Tributyltin (TBT) is an umbrella term for a class of organotin compounds which contain the (C 4 H 9) 3 Sn group, with a prominent example being tributyltin oxide. For 40 years TBT was used as a biocide in anti-fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint, which was applied to the hulls of ocean going vessles. TBT compounds are organotin compounds, with 3 butyl groups covalently bonded to a tin(IV) centre. A general formula for these compounds is (n-C 4 H 9) 3 Sn-X. The X group is typically an electronegative leaving group such as chloride or carboxylate ..
