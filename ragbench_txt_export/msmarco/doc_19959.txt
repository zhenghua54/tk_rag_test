In these circumstances, the state’s three-year statute of limitations does not prevent Larry’s prosecution for burglary, because the statute of limitations was not running down during the three years that Larry was in a different state. In cases involving crimes against minors, the majority of states provide that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the victim turns 18. The laws vary greatly state by state; any time limit for bringing an action will depend on the rules of the state where the crime was committed.
