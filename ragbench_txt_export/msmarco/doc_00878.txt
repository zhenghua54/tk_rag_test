Difference between oceanic and continental crust. : - The crust is thinner (thus relatively denser and heavier) beneath the oceans, where it is up to about 8km thick. It consists mostly of basaltic types of rocks. Geologists refer to this oceanic crustal material as Sima, after its two main chemical constituents which are silica (Si) and magnesium (Ma).
