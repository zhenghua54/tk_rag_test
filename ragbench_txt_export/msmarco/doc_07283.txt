Example Using the Geography Data Type. To demonstrate the use of the geography data type I have created a table in the MSSQLTIPS database called EarthquakeData. A newsletter entitled SpatialNews Daily is sent out daily and included in the newsletter is data on all earthquakes in the world for the previous days. Like the geometry data type, the geography data type is housed as a binary representation of the coordinate, known as the Well-Known Binary Representation, a data type created through the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).
