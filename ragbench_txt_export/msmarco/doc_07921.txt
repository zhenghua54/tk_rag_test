Put cleaned and trimmed brussels sprouts in a large bowl with a scant tablespoon or so of water on the bottom, cover the brussels sprouts with a microwave-safe lid or plate (avoid plastic wrap in microwaves), and cook on high power for 1 minute. Bring a scant 1/2 inch salted water to boil in a large frying pan or saute pan. Add the brussels sprouts, cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the sprouts are tender to the bite and the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes (depending on how crisp you like your cooked sprouts).
