Remove steak from milk, dredge in flour mixture, place into skillet and brown on both sides. Continue cooking until all steaks are cooked. CREAM GRAVY: 1/3 c. hot steak drippings 1/4 c. flour 2 c. milk Salt and pepper to taste I use another skillet, let it get hot and add steak drippings, flour, salt and pepper. Stir with wire whisk until blended. Next add 2 cups milk, continuing to stir until gravy thickens.
