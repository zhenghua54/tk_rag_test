And the silent isle imbowers. The Lady of Shalott. (lines 17-18). We think this line really rides on that big vocab word: imbowers.. This means to close up in a bower, which is an old term that refers to a lady's private room. In another kind of poem, this could be associated with protection, keeping someone safe from the outside world.
