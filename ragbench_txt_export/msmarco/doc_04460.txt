A healthy blood glucose level is between 70 and 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). According to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association, diabetes is diagnosed if the level is above 200 mg/dL in a random test, and the person has symptoms of diabetes. If someone has symptoms of diabetes but the random blood glucose level is below 200 mg/dL, the doctor will want to follow up with a fasting blood glucose test or other test.
