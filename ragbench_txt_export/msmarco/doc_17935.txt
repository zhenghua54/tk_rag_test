To just have your typical yearly checkup done, it's not very expensive-all vets have a flat rate for this, and they'll tell you what it is on the phone if you call to ask. Mine charges $40 per cat for a checkup, $38 if you're coming in for a re-check or for a non-yearly checkup. You'll get charged whatever this is just for coming in, it's like the fee to reserve the half hour of the vet's time.
