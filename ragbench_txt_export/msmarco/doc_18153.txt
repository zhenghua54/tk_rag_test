You can carry any amount of cash on your person as you feel comfortable with losing! The only restrictions that I know of are when travelling to foreign countries. You can legally carry up to $10,000.00 without declaration. Any amount over $10,000 requires you to declare it when you enter through Customs. Cash on person. Is there a limit to the amount of cash a person is legally allowed to carry on their person at all, I would imagine not but I was told it was something I had to be careful of and wanted to check.
