Average Charges. Professional electricians may actually charge anywhere from $40 to $100 an hour, depending on the job and the skill level of the person performing it. For instance, a licensed journeyman averaged a $54.39 per hour charge for residential work as of 2012, according to the Top Electricians website. If an apprentice electrician is sent to perform a simpler job, the charge may be lower, with an average of $39.79 an hour. For instance, many electricians will charge a higher rate for the first hour of work or include additional charges for travel. They may also charge a minimum fee, often the equivalent of one hour of work, for even the simplest and quickest of jobs.
