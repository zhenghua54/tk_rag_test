Ryne Dee Sandberg (born September 18, 1959), nicknamed Ryno , is an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs for sixteen years (1981–1994 and 1996–97). In 1990, Sandberg led the National League in home runs–a rarity for a second baseman–with 40. Sandberg was only the third second baseman to hit 40 home runs; Rogers Hornsby and Davey Johnson hit 42, and no American League second baseman has yet reached forty.
