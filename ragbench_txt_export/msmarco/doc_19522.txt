Tradition holds that the surname Silver inscribed on a tomb in the Calton cemetery, Edinburgh, suggested to Robert Louis Stevenson the name of Long John Silver in the famous book Treasure Island. Early examples of the surname recordings include: Radolfus Silberer of Oberschwaben, Germany, in 1249, whilst Thomas atte Selure, and Thomas del Silvere were both recorded in the Subsidy Rolls of the county of Worcestershire in 1327 and 1332 respectively.
