Linda's favorite and easy-to-make ceviche recipe: Shrimp Martini Ceviche with Chili-Cumin Chips. The new in food of the beginning of the 21st century is actually an old world dish from South America called Ceviche. The preparation and consumption of ceviche is practically a religion in parts of Mexico, Central, and South America, and it seems as though there are as many varieties of ceviche as people who eat it. Latin American flavors first found a place on Florida menus with South Florida's New World Cuisine in the late 1980's.
