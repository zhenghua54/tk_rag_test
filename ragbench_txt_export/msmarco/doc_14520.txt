We spoke to Dr. Nicholas Perricone, a dermatologist and nutritionist with an eponymous skincare line, and Dr. Maryann Mikhail, a New York-based dermatologist, to get the lowdown on what exactly sugar does to your skin and what you can do about it. Exfoliation is an important and easy way to buff away the dead skin cells that cover up your skin's natural glow. Use a light exfoliator, like the Daily Microfoliant from Dermalogica, to freshen your face daily. When choosing a foundation, test a product on the skin near your jawline.
