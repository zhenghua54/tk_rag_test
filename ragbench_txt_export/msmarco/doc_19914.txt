The CMP is a frequently ordered panel that gives your doctor important information about the current status of your kidneys, liver, and electrolyte and acid/base balance as well as of your blood sugar and blood proteins. You may be intending to request a comprehensive metabolic panel. You may also request that your physician give you a copy of your test results. If you continue to have difficulty to communicate with your physician, perhaps you may consider seeking a second opinion.
