Temperate Deciduous Forest Biome Characteristics. The temperate deciduous forest biome receives a large amount of rain annually. In the summer the polar air masses cause it. In the winter, it is the result of the polar and arctic masses that are moving south. The humidity is also a factor in this type of biome. It ranges from 60% to 80% all the time. The largest temperate deciduous forest biome is found in the Northern part of Russian and into Scandinavia.
