This is an ancient Scottish name, the patronymic (meaning son of) form of Hendry, a mainly Scottish variant of the personal name Henry. Some bearers of the name Henderson are descended from Henrysons, the d being a common intrusive element in many languages between n and r. A branch of the Clan Gunn bears the name Henderson, and there is another Clan Henderson of Glencoe. An interesting namebearer, recorded in the Dictionary of National Biography, was John Henderson (1747 - 1785), who was a notable actor of his day, considered second only to David Garrick.
