Before you adjust the temperature on your water heater: Read your water heater owner’s manual for instructions on how to operate the thermostat (whether Gas or Electric). FOR GAS WATER HEATERS: You will find a thermostat dial near the bottom of the tank on the gas valve. Increasing your water heater temperature by just 10ºF from 130ºF to 140ºF may increase heat loss resulting in a larger electric bill from $30 to $75 dollars annually. Setting the temperature to 140ºF can also increase demand losses resulting in an annual expense of up to $500 dollars.
