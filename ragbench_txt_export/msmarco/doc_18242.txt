The aim of this organization was to halt the corruption of art and inform the people about the relationship between race and art. By 1933, the terms Jewish, Degenerate, and Bolshevik were in common use to describe almost all modern art. In 1937, Nazi officials purged German museums of works the Party considered to be degenerate. From the thousands of works removed, 650 were chosen for a special exhibit of Entartete Kunst.
