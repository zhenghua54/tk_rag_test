Shares & Saves. Save. When calculating the cost of adding an additional room to your house, a lot depends on what the space will be used for. A 10x12 kitchen or bathroom will be more expensive than a similarly-sized living space in the home as the price of fixtures and appliances tends to drive prices up. In other words, you could half the average cost to add a 10x12 room to your house by simply doing the labor yourself, reducing the estimate from $11,400 to about $5,700.
