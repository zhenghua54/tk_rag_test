Oftentimes, patients choose their surgeon on the basis of price. Cosmetic surgery is very affordable in the Philippines and costs are much lower when compared to the United States and other countries. To avoid unsatisfactory results, it is best to choose a surgeon who has completed an accredited residency training program in plastic and reconstructive surgery. He should have extensive experience in the procedure you will undergo.
