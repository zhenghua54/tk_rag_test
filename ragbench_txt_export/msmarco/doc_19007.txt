Your healthcare provider may choose to increase the fluoxetine dosage if symptoms continue or decrease the dose if side effects occur. The maximum dose of fluoxetine for these conditions is 80 mg per day. Doses above 20 mg can be taken once a day or divided into two doses and taken twice a day. Prozac Weekly, the long-acting form of fluoxetine approved for depression, can be used to replace daily doses of fluoxetine 20 mg. Because all fluoxetine stays in your system for so long, the first dose of Prozac Weekly should be taken one week after stopping fluoxetine 20 mg daily. As you might guess, Prozac Weekly is taken once per week (on the same day each week).
