Each gram of TOBRADEX Ointment contains: Actives: Tobramycin 0.3% (3 mg) and Dexamethasone 0.1% (1 mg). Preservative: Chlorobutanol 0.5% Inactives: Mineral Oil and White Petrolatum. Uses Actions Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. If the maximum dose of TOBRADEX Ophthalmic Suspension is given for the first 48 hours (two drops in each eye every 2 hours) and complete systemic absorption occurs, which is highly unlikely, the daily dose of dexamethasone would be 2.4 mg.
