Your male breast reduction surgery recovery process will depend on the extent of your surgery. Liposuction-only breast reduction may involve a shorter recovery period than gynecomastia surgery plus liposuction. You will likely need someone to drive you home after surgery and possibly help out at home for a day or two following the procedure. There will be some discomfort for a few days after your surgery. Be sure to discuss the details of your male breast reduction recovery with your surgeon during your consultation. He or she will be able to fill you in on the specifics and let you know how much time you will need to take off work.
