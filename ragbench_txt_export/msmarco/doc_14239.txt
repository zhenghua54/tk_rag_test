colormap(map) sets the colormap for the current figure to the colormap specified by map. The figure colormap affects all axes in the figure, unless you set an axes colormap separately. Use this syntax if you want to use a built-in colormap with a specific number of colors or if you want to use a custom colormap. Return the colormap values for a specific axes by passing its axes handle to the colormap function. Create a figure with two subplots and return the axes handles, ax1 and ax2. Add a filled contour plot to each axes and use a different colormap for each axes.
