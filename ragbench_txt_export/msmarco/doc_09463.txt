With Windows XP, I could press CTRL and B to bold, CTRL and I to italicize, CTRL and U to underline. I can't do that with Windows 8.1. Can someone tell me how to do this with the key board? I do not want to use the touch screen to do it: I want to use the keyboard. Use Ctrl + B to bold letters. Use Ctrl + I to Italics. Use Ctrl + U to underline. Thank you. Hi, Try these combination keys and check if this helps
