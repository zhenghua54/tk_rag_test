Zanamivir is used to treat flu symptoms caused by influenza virus in patients who have had symptoms for less than 2 days. Zanamivir may also be given to prevent influenza in people who may be exposed but do not yet have symptoms. Treatment with zanamivir should start as soon as possible when flu symptoms appear, such as fever, chills, muscle aches, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose. Do not use this medication to treat flu symptoms in a child younger than 7 years old.
