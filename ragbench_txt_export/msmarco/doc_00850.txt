Guide to IPL Skin Rejuvenation. IPL skin rejuvenation is a common cosmetic procedure designed to produce a clear, healthy and beautiful complexion. There are a variety of specific skin issues that can be solved using IPL, from certain types of conditions, to blemishes, wrinkles, the effects of ageing, and more. It is important to understand that IPL skin rejuvenation utilises light waves, not laser. These terms are often used interchangeably by many individuals, however, this is not correct. A separate treatment, known as laser skin resurfacing, is also utilised as a cosmetic treatment for some similar conditions.
