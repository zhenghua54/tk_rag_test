Zendesk is a customer service platform. Itâ€™s designed for companies that want to create customer relationships that are more meaningful, personal, and productive. We start by helping companies provide great support and then mature with self-service and proactive engagement. Zendesk moved its San Francisco headquarters to the Tenderloin in 2011, a famous and deeply historic neighborhood in the heart of the city that was unfortunately neglected for decades.
