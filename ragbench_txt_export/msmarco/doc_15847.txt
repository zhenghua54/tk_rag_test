You can say carbon is the main thing here. Compounds of carbon [except oxides, ca â€¦ rbonates, bicarbonates] are termed as organic. Water does not contain a carbon atom. So it is inorganic. Carbon dioxide is considered by chemists as inorganic, along with carbon monoxide, carbonates and bicarbonates. Nature has not distinguished compounds into inorganic and organic compounds that clearly. These compounds of carbon are just assumed to be inorganic. Also there is that one thing about carbon being covalently bonded with hydrogen in organic compounds. Due to that criteria carbon dioxide is considered inorganic. But actually there is no clear reason. 1 person found this useful. 1  The Five Major Parts of the Brain At its most basic, the brain controls the body.
