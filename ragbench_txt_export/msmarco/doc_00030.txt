How long your organisation needs to keep it's records. Your organisation must hold all records for seven years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). For GST you do not need to hold a tax invoice for items costing less than $50, but you do need to maintain a record of such payments. For income tax, you should have invoices for all expenses, whatever the amount.
