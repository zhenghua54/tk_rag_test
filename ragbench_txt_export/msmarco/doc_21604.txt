Re: Marine Surveyor Cost. Most surveys in this area (coastal Carolinas) are between $10 and $15 per foot.....some surveyors also have a minimum charge. These fees do not cover haul out or engine/generator surveys. RE: Marine Surveyor Cost. Recently done in SW Florida: It cost me the loss of a purchase of a used boat because it seems the seller is balking on fixing a hull void on a SW Fla W/A. Cost was $15.00 ft, had a low quote of $12.00 Engine diag and ck was another $200.00.
