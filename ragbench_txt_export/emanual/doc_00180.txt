Read before setting up a wireless Internet connection. Precautions for wireless Internet This TV supports the IEEE 802.11 a /b /g /n /ac communication protocols. Samsung recommends using IEEE 802.11n. Video files stored on a device connected to the TV via a Home Network may not play back smoothly. IEEE 802.11 ac communication protocol may not be supported depending on the model. To use wireless Internet, the TV must be connected to a wireless router or modem. If the wireless router supports DHCP, the TV can use a DHCP or static IP address to connect to the wireless network. Select a channel that is not currently being used by the wireless router. If the channel set is currently being used by the wireless router to communicate with another device, the result is usually interference and/or a communications failure. Most wireless networks have an optional security system. To enable a wireless network's security system, you need to create a password using characters and numbers. This password is then needed to connect to a security-enabled AP. Wireless security protocols The TV only supports the following wireless network security protocols. The TV cannot connect to non-certified wireless routers. Authentication Modes: WEP, WPAPSK, WPA2PSK Encryption Types: WEP, TKIP, AES In compliance with the newest Wi-Fi certification specifications, Samsung TVs do not support WEP or TKIP security encryption in networks running in the 802.11n mode. If the wireless router supports WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), you can connect the TV to your network using PBC (Push Button Configuration) or a PIN (Personal Identification Number). WPS automatically configures the SSID and WPA key settings.
