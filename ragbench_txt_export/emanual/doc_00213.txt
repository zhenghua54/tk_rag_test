Blocking Programs based on their Downloadable U.S. Rating. This rating system only applies to material originating from US DTV channels. Parental restriction information is automatically downloaded while you watch DTV channels. This download may take several seconds. If the information is unavailable from the broadcasting station, the Downloadable U.S. Rating menu is deactivated. Parental restriction levels differ with the broadcasting station. The default menu name and the Downloadable U.S. Rating name changes depending on the downloaded information. Even when the on-screen display is set to another language, the Downloadable U.S. Rating menu appears only in English. Select a lock beside one of the rating categories to block that category and all higher categories. To unblock a category, select the lock icon.
