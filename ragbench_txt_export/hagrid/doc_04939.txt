The fruit is also known as jabong in Hawaii and jambola in varieties of English spoken in South Asia.
Typically, the fruit is pale green to yellow when ripe, with sweet white (or, more rarely, pink or red) flesh, and a very thick albedo (rind pith). It is a large citrus fruit, in diameter, usually weighing . Leaf petioles are distinctly winged.
The typical pomelo is much larger than the grapefruit, and also has a much thicker rind. It tastes like a sweet, mild grapefruit (believed to be a hybrid of "Citrus maxima" and the orange). The flesh has none, or very little, of the common grapefruit's bitterness. The enveloping membranous material around the segments is bitter, considered inedible, and usually discarded.
