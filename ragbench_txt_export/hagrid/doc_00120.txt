Early airships used hydrogen as their lifting gas, which is the lightest available. Typically, hydrogen was generated during the filling process, by reacting dilute sulphuric acid with metal filings. The first hydrogen balloon in 1783 used iron filings, while the British Nulli Secundus of 1907 used zinc.
