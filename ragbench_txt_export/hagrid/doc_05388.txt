Alfie Moon is played by Shane Richie. The character originally appeared in the soap opera "EastEnders" from 2002 to 2005, and 2010 to 2016. Before his departure from "EastEnders", he discovers he has a mass on his brain. Of Alfie's part in "Redwater", Richie said, "Alfie's journey is to help his wife find her son but at the same time he has his own dark secret which he's keeping." Richie later said, "For the first time in 15 years, [Alfie] questions himself as a father, a husband and as a life, it feels like it's coming to an end for him. [...] Alfie starts getting hallucinations and one in particular is quite harrowing."
