Authors who call the entire family "Siouan" distinguish the two branches as "Western Siouan" and "Eastern Siouan" or as "Siouan-proper" and "Catawban". Others restrict the name "Siouan" to the western branch and use the name "Siouanâ€“Catawban" for the entire family. Generally, however, the name "Siouan" is used without distinction.
