Following the end of "Dinner: Impossible" (which continues in reruns), Irvine embarked on two new projects with Food Network. In late 2010, the Food Network began advertising the second season of "Worst Cooks in America" featuring Irvine (replacing Chef Beau MacMillan) training a cadre of would-be cooks in competition with Chef Anne Burrell. The show premiered on 3 January 2011. In advance of the show's premiere, Irvine teamed with Cat Cora to battle Burrell and Michael Symon in the special "Battle Deep Freeze" on "Iron Chef America".
