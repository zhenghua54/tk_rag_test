Since its initial serialization, "Nausicaä" has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 film adaptation, written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters, received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of "Nausicaä" are also credited for the foundation of Studio Ghibli, the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.
