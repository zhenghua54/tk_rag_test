"The Cosby Show", airing from 1984 until 1992, spent five consecutive seasons as the number one rated show on television. "The Cosby Show" and "All in the Family" are the only sitcoms in the history of the Nielsen ratings, to be the number one show for five seasons. It spent all eight of its seasons in the Top 20. According to "TV Guide", the show "was TV's biggest hit in the 1980s, and almost single handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC's ratings fortunes." "TV Guide" also ranked it 28th on their list of "50 Greatest Shows". In addition, Cliff Huxtable was named as the "Greatest Television Dad". In May 1992, "Entertainment Weekly" stated that "The Cosby Show" helped to make possible a larger variety of shows with a predominantly African-American cast, from "In Living Color" to "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".
