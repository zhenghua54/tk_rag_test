Several elements were discovered as a consequence of lengthy analysis and decomposition of the ore Gadolinite. As the ore was progressively analysed, the residue was first given the label ceria and then lanthana and then subsequently yttria, erbia, and terbia. In order of date discovered, the list of elements includes Cerium 58, Lanthanum 57, Erbium 68, Terbium 65, Yttrium 39, Ytterbium 70, Holmium 67, Thulium 69, Scandium 21, Praseodymium 59, Neodymium 60 and Dysprosium 66. Several of these new elements were either discovered or isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in the 1830s and 1840s.
