Drug dealer Callum Logan (Sean Ward), the biological father of Max Turner (Harry McDermott), harasses the Platt family for custody of Max for several months. He particularly antagonises David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), due to his remarks about Max's mother and David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane). Callum begins a relationship with Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), to the Platts' dismay. Callum manipulates Sarah's teenage daughter Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) to buy drugs for him whilst he films her. Sarah splits up with Callum in August 2015 after Max finds a gun in his bedroom in Callum's flat. Callum shows Sarah the footage of Bethany buying the drugs. Sarah warns Bethany to stay away from Callum.
