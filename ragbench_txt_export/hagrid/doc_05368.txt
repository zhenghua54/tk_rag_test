The name "hassium" was proposed by Peter Armbruster and his colleagues, the officially recognised German discoverers, in September 1992. It is derived from the Latin name "Hassia" for the German state of Hesse where the institute is located. In 1994, IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry recommended that element 108 be named "hahnium" (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (meitnerium) would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This was because they felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. GSI protested saying that this contradicted the long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name; the American Chemical Society supported the GSI. IUPAC relented and the name "hassium" (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.
