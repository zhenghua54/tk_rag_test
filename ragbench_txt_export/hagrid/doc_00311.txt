The 1935 Sugar Bowl was the first Sugar Bowl game. Tulane (9–1) hosted unbeaten Temple (7–0–2) before a crowd of 22,206 in New Orleans. Temple took a 14–0 lead before Tulane came back to win the game, 20–14. The game was played at Tulane's home field, so it was technically a home game for the Green Wave. Temple had been ranked 15th in a November 15, 1934, AP football poll.
