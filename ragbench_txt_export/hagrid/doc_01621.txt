Lynn was born in 1932 and raised in the mining community of Butcher Hollow, Van Lear, Kentucky. Loretta was the second of eight children. She was named after the film star Loretta Young. Lynn's father died in 1959 of black lung disease, so he was not able to see her success in the music industry. Her first single, "I'm A Honky Tonk Girl", was released the following year.
