Under the National Energy Efficient Fan Programme, EESL provides BEE 5 Star rated ceiling fans which are 30% more energy efficient than conventional fans. Fans will be sold for Rs. 1,150 per fan. EESL has distributed 6.2 lakh energy efficient fans under this scheme which will save 2.4 lakh kWh and Rs 8.2 lakh per day to the consumers. The price difference is Rs. 500 which is the primary reason for its low penetration, along with the lack of awareness. With the usage of these energy efficient fans it is estimated that consumerâ€™s electricity bills will reduce by about Rs. 700-730 per year, and recover the extra cost in less than 2 years.
