Magnetoreception is well documented in honey bees, ants and termites. In ants and bees, this is used to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and within their migratory paths. For example, through the use of magnetoreception, the Brazilian stingless bee "Schwarziana quadripunctata" is able to distinguish differences in altitude, location, and directionality using the thousands of hair-like particles on its antennae.
