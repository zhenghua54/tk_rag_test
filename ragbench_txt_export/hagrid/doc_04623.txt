The early Byzantine church developed a system of eight musical modes (the octoechos), which served as a model for medieval European chant theorists when they developed their own modal classification system starting in the 9th century. The success of the Western synthesis of this system with elements from the fourth book of "De institutione musica" of Boethius, created the false impression that the Byzantine octoechos was inherited directly from ancient Greece.
