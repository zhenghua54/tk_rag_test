A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4â€“4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned in which vorinostat will be combined with other drugs.
