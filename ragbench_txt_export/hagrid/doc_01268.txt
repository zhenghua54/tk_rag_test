Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in "Action Comics" #1 in 1938, which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to Earth. He made his first full-fledged appearance in the "Superman" newspaper comic strip in 1939, where his name was spelled as "Jor-L". His name first appeared as being spelled "Jor-el" in the "Superman" novel "The Adventures of Superman" (1942) written by George Lowther. Later comic books capitalized the "E" in "El." Jor-El's first appearance in an actual comic book was in "More Fun Comics" #101. After the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse system in the 1960s, it was established that the version of Superman's father during the Golden Age of Comic Books was named "Jor-L", and he lived on the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe. However, "Jor-El" was the father of the Silver Age version of Superman, and he lived on the Krypton of the Earth-One universe.
