Amblyodipsas is a genus of snakes found in Africa. Currently, 9 species are recognized. These snakes are often known as purple-glossed snakes or glossy snakes. Although rear-fanged, all species are considered harmless, but their venom has not been well studied. They should not be confused with the glossy snakes of the genus "Arizona", which are found in North America.
