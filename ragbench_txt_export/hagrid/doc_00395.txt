For the purpose of the Judicial order, until 2014, Portugal was divided in 231 uneven "comarcas", constituting the territorial areas of jurisdiction of the courts of first instance. With some adjustments carried away over the years, that division was essentiality the one established in the judiciary reform of 1835. Depending on the size of its population, each "comarca" could have from a single court of general jurisdiction with just a single judge to a complex structure of diverse courts of special jurisdiction (civil, criminal, criminal procedure, labour, family, etc.), each of which, by itself, could include several specialized sections and judgeships. The "comarcas" were grouped in 57 judicial circles ("c√≠rculos judiciais") and these in four judicial districts ("distritos judiciais").
