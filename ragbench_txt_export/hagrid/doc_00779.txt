If the Vice President-elect dies or resigns "before" the meeting of the Electoral College in December, the National Committee of the winning party would, in consultation with the president-elect, choose a replacement to receive the electoral votes of the Vice Presidential nominee in the same manner as would happen if the former Vice Presidential nominee had become President-elect due to the death of the apparent winner. Assuming the requisite number the electors agreed to vote for the replacement candidate, that person would then become the Vice President-elect. If such a vacancy were to occur "after" the electoral votes had been cast in the states, most authorities maintain that no replacement would be chosen and the new President (after taking office) would nominate a Vice President, per the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
