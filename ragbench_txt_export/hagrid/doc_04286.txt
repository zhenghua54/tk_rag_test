The earliest known references to the druids date to the fourth century BCE and the oldest detailed description comes from Julius Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico" (50s BCE). They were also described by later Greco-Roman writers such as Cicero, Tacitus, and Pliny the Elder. Following the Roman invasion of Gaul, the druid orders were suppressed by the Roman government under the 1st century CE emperors Tiberius and Claudius, and had disappeared from the written record by the 2nd century.
