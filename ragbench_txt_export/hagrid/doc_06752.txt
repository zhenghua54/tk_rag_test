While only released in digital form, "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" was a commercial success. It was the best selling game on the PlayStation Store in Europe for the month of its release. According to director Tameem Antoniades the game sold "better than expected" and broke even in approximately three months, ahead of the six to nine months the developers expected. "PC Gamer" stated about "Hellblade"s success that "the news can only be positive. Perhaps if other developers see an experimental game like "Hellblade" finding commercial success then they'll be more likely to take risks on their own titlesâ€”and that, ultimately, will lead to more interesting games". To celebrate World Mental Health Day on October 10, 2017, Ninja Theory donated all profit made from the sales of "Hellblade" on that day to Rethink Mental Illness. By June 2018, the game had sold over a million copies across all three platforms.
