The term "conurbation" was coined in 1915 by Patrick Geddes in his book "Cities In Evolution". He drew attention to the ability of the then new technology of electric power and motorised transport to allow cities to spread and agglomerate together, and gave as examples "Midlandton" in England, the Ruhr in Germany, Randstad in the Netherlands and North Jersey in the United States.
