The following excerpt is taken from an article written in June that year, which describes the completion of No. 1 Volunteer Company's new fire station in Pitt Street, Haymarket. It is significant in that it provides an insight into the deficiencies of Sydney's fire alarm system, and suggests a solution:
This reference, in June 1857, to Thomas Bown possessing "a large bell" is the earliest indication that Number 470 Bell had arrived in Sydney. Number 470 Bell was manufactured by Glasgow bellfounder: John C. Wilson, on 20 January 1855. Wilson's company, "Gorbals Brass and Bell Foundry", supplied numerous bells to the colonies (including Sydney and Melbourne). The Company's register of bells describes bell number 470 as a rough finished (ie unpolished), 26 inch (66cm), Turret Bell of 350lbs; 12ozs (159kg). It also records that the bell was sold to Thomas Bown through an agent (Mr Alexander) who sold numerous bells to the Australian colonies.
