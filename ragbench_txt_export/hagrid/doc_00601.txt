A French creole, or French-based creole language, is a creole language (contact language with native speakers) for which French is the "lexifier". Most often this lexifier is not modern French but rather a 17th-century koin√© of French from Paris, the French Atlantic harbors, and the nascent French colonies. French-based creole languages are spoken natively by millions of people worldwide, primarily in the Americas and on archipelagos throughout the Indian Ocean. This article also contains information on French pidgin languages, contact languages that lack native speakers.
