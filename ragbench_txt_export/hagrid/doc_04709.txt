Venus's atmosphere is made mostly out of carbon dioxide, which, after filtering from sulfuric acid, can be used to grow food. Because nitrogen and oxygen are lighter than the carbon-dioxide that makes the atmosphere, breathable-air-filled balloons will float at a height of about . At this height, the temperature is a manageable ; or if we could get higher (see ).
