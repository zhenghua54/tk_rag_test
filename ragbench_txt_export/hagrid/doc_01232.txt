is a Toei-produced parody series that premiered in April 2012 on BS Asahi and Tokyo MX. "Akibaranger" is made for adult fans who were fans of the Super Sentai Series as children. The story features three otaku who live in the Akihabara district of Tokyo who receive technology from a scientist to fight an evil threat that at first only exists in their delusions, but eventually starts materializing itself in the real world. Like "Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger", "Akibaranger" features guest appearances by veteran Super Sentai actors (as themselves rather than their characters), and voice actors and musicians who have worked in anime and "tokusatsu". A second season aired in April 2013.
