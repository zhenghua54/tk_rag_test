Bonanza City is a ghost town in New Mexico, southwest of Santa Fe. Nothing remained of the town but remnants of foundations. A movie set (Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch) was built near the remains and has been used for several films. The 2007 TV show, Kid Nation, was filmed here for one season which aired on CBS.
