Jumps are referred to by how many times the skater turns in the air. One revolution (one and a half for the Axel) is a "single" jump. Two revolutions (two and a half for the Axel) is a "double" jump. Three revolutions (three and a half for the Axel) is a "triple" jump. Four revolutions (four and a half for the Axel, although this has never been done in competition) is a "quadruple" or "quad" jump. The first triple jump landed in competition was a loop jump. It was landed by Dick Button in 1952. The first quadruple jump landed in competition was a toe loop jump. It was landed by Kurt Browning in 1988. Currently, men in world-class competition usually attempt a full set of triples and sometimes one or two quadruple jumps in their free skating programs. Triple Axels are rare for ladies, and quadruple jump attempts even more so.
