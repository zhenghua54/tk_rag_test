In 2008, it was decided to make "Type-0" a PSP exclusive, cancelling the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed "Crisis Core", but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on "The 3rd Birthday". Because of these conflicting projects, "Type-0" came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from "Final Fantasy XIII", since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was "Final Fantasy Live", referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, "Final Fantasy Type-0," was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.
