Most Jews do not believe in the existence of a supernatural omnimalevolent figure. Traditionalists and philosophers in medieval Judaism adhered to rational theology, rejecting any belief in rebel or fallen angels, and viewing evil as abstract. The Rabbis usually interpreted the word "satan" as it is used in the Tanakh as referring strictly to "human" adversaries and rejected all of the Enochian writings mentioning Satan as a literal, heavenly figure from the Biblical canon, making every attempt to root them out. Nonetheless, the word "satan" has occasionally been metaphorically applied to evil influences, such as the Jewish exegesis of the "yetzer hara" ("evil inclination") mentioned in . Rabbinical scholarship on the Book of Job generally follows the Talmud and Maimonides in identifying "the satan" from the prologue as a metaphor for the "yetzer hara" and not an actual entity. Satan is rarely mentioned in Tannaitic literature, but is found in Babylonian aggadah. According to a narration, the sound of the shofar, which is primarily intended to remind Jews of the importance of "teshuva", is also intended symbolically to "confuse the accuser" (Satan) and prevent him from rendering any litigation to God against the Jews. In Hasidic Judaism, the Kabbalah presents Satan as an agent of God whose function is to tempt humans into sinning so that he may accuse them in the heavenly court. The Hasidic Jews of the 18th century associated ha-Satan with "Baal Davar".
