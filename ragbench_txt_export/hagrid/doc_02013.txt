Roy E. Appleman, the author of US Army official history "South to Naktong, North to Yalu", writes that both sides could claim victory: the PVA 9th Army ultimately held the battlefield, while X Corps held off the Chinese 9th Army in a series of battles that enabled it to withdraw most of its forces as an effective tactical unit. Allan R. Millett qualifies a Chinese "geographic victory" that ejected X Corps from North Korea with the fact that the Chinese failed to achieve the objective of destroying the 1st Marine Division, adding that the campaign gave the UN confidence that it could withstand the superior numbers of the Chinese forces. The official Chinese history, published by PLA Academy of Military Science, states that despite the heavy casualties, the PVA 9th Army had earned its victory by successfully protecting the eastern flank of Chinese forces in Korea, while inflicting over 10,000 casualties to the UN forces.
