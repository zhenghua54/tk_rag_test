Genetic testing is important as if a test comes out positive they are more aware of their own personal health and the health of immediate family members. With the help and advice from a medical professional they can take steps to reduce their elevated risk of cancer development through:
There are other forms of preventative actions, an example for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer would be to go through surgery: A hysterectomy is the removal of all or some of the uterus, whereas a mastectomy is removing a breast (double mastectomy meaning that both breasts are removed), this can often add years onto their life expectancy. Another preventative measure is regular cancer screening and check-ups. If a person has Lynch’s syndrome then they should have a regular colonoscopy to examine if there is any change in the cells lining the intestinal wall, regular check-ups have been proven to add an average of 7 years onto the life expectancy of a person suffering from Lynch’s syndrome as early detection means the correct preventative actions and surgery can be taken quicker. Regular breast screening is also recommended for women diagnosed with BRCA mutations, as well as that, recent studies show that men with increased risks of developing prostate cancer due to BRCA mutations can decrease their risk by taking aspirin. Aspirin is hugely beneficial in lowering cancer prevalence; however, it must be taken regularly over at least a five-year period to have any effect.
