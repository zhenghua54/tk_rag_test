The United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system of learning. U.K. engineering technologists have always been designated as "engineers". The term "engineer" in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled worker, and professionals from trades people through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer. In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as "Technologists" to distinguish them from scientists, technicians and craftsmen. The modern term for an engineering technologist is "incorporated engineer" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a Bachelors or Honours Degree in engineering. Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the EngTech professional qualification and with further studies at higher apprenticeship level an IEng. Since 2015 the UK government (UCAS) has introduced engineering degree (Bachelors and Masters) apprenticeships. The title "incorporated engineer" is protected by civil law. Prior to the title "incorporated engineer", U.K. technologists were known as "technician engineers" a designation introduced in the 1960s.
