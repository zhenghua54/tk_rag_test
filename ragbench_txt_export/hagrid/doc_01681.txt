Given a circle, let "u" be the perimeter of an inscribed regular "n-"gon, and let "U" be the perimeter of a circumscribed regular "n-"gon. Then "u" and "U" are lower and upper bounds for the circumference of the circle that become sharper and sharper as "n" increases, and their average ("u" + "U")/2 is an especially good approximation to the circumference. To compute "u" and "U" for large "n", Archimedes derived the following doubling formulae:
