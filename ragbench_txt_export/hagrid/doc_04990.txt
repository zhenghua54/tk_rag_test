The word "ringgit" is an obsolete term for "jagged" in Malay and was originally used to refer to the serrated edges of silver Spanish dollars which circulated widely in the area during the 16th and 17th century Portuguese colonial era. In modern usage "ringgit" is used almost solely for the currency. Due to the common heritage of the three modern currencies, the Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar are also called "ringgit" in Malay (currencies such as the US and Australian dollars are translated as "dolar"), although nowadays the Singapore dollar is more commonly called "dolar" in Malay. To differentiate between the three currencies, the Malaysian currency is referred to as "Ringgit Malaysia", hence the official abbreviation and currency symbol "RM". Internationally, the ISO 4217 currency code for Malaysian ringgit is "MYR".
