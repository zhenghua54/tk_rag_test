In local government, a "sui generis" entity is one that does not fit with the general scheme of local governance of a country. For example in England, the City of London and the Isles of Scilly are the two "sui generis" localities, as their forms of local government are both (for historical or geographical reasons) very different from those of elsewhere in the country.  In a press conference during which reporters were trying to analyse his political personality, Huey Long said, "...say that I am "sui generus", and let it go at that."
