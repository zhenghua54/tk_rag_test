As a result, on November 7, 2012, Silicon Knights was directed by the court to destroy all game code derived from Unreal Engine 3, all information from licensee-restricted areas of Epic's Unreal Engine documentation website, and to permit Epic Games access to the company's servers and other devices to ensure these items have been removed. In addition, the studio was instructed to recall and destroy all unsold retail copies of games built with Unreal Engine 3 code, including "Too Human", "X-Men Destiny", "The Sandman", "The Box"/"Ritualyst", and "Siren in the Maelstrom" (the latter three titles were projects never released, or even officially announced).
