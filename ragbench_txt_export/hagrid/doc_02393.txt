Set in Los Angeles, California, "The Bold and the Beautiful" centers around the Forrester family and their fashion house business, Forrester Creations. Stephanie Douglas, a strong-willed woman, daughter of wealthy Chicago businessman John Douglas, met her husband-to-be Eric Forrester, who aspired to become a fashion designer, while they both studied at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. The young lovers hurried to get married after Stephanie became pregnant. They moved to Los Angeles, California, where they established "Forrester Creations", designing and producing upscale men's and women's fashion, based on Eric's designing talent and Stephanie's financial funding. While winning international recognition, fame, and wealth with their work, the couple managed to raise four children in a happy and caring environment. The children are: elder and favorite son Ridge, brother Thorne and younger sisters Kristen and Felicia. It was discovered years later, when the children were all adults, that Stephanie's elder son, Ridge, was actually fathered by Massimo Marone. Like many soap operas, "The Bold and the Beautiful" looks into the lives of wealthy families and how love affairs, scandals, and betrayals affect each of the family members and their relationships with each other.
