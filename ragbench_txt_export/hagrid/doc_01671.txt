Cinderella is the second Disney Princess. Her movie, Disney's 12th animated feature film, is named after her, "Cinderella", released in 1950. Forced into servitude by her evil stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and her two cruel stepsisters, Drizella and Anastasia, after her father's death, her only source of happiness was her animal friends, which consists of birds and mice. While scrubbing the floors of her late father's mansion, an invitation to the Prince's ball is delivered, inviting all of the eligible women to attend so that he can find a wife. While Cinderella meets the requirements to attend, her stepfamily forbids her, going so far as to rip apart the clothes that the mice and birds had created for her as the carriage arrives. When all seems lost, her fairy godmother gives her the means to attend, where she falls in love with the Prince.
