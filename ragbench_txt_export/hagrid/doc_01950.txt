As a definite geographic location within the United States, "Dixie" is usually defined as the eleven Southern states that seceded in late 1860 and early 1861 to form the new Confederate States of America. They are (in order of secession): South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Maryland never seceded from the Union, but many of their citizens favored the Confederacy. Whilst many of Marylandâ€™s representatives were arrested to prevent secession, both the states of Missouri and Kentucky produced Ordinances of Secession and were admitted into the Confederacy. Note that West Virginia was part of Virginia until 1863; counties that chose not to secede from the Union became part of West Virginia.
