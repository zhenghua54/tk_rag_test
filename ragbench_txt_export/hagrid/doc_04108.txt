Punjab has not allowed the construction of the SYL and will not allow it ever. All river waters in the world are allocate on the basis of riparian law, however in this case a grave injustice is being done to Punjab. As stated above J&K has started utilizing Ravi water and does not need Punjab s consent. Punjab needs to implement the same formula of utilizing water for its exclusive usage instead of letting it flow to Haryana and Rajasthan who instead of being thankful to Punjab have started demanding its share as well.
