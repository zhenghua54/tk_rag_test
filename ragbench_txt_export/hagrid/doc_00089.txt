The population of Tanzania as per the 2002 national census is 34,569,232. The majority of its citizens live in the rural villages, but with time the pace of migration to urban areas (especially youth) is increasing. In the rural areas unsustainable natural resource use push the population away, while social services and employment pull people towards the urban areas.
