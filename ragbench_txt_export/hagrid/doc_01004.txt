George Edmund Royce was born in Orwell, Vermont on 1 January 1829 to Alpheus Royce and Harriet (Moore) Royce. He attended public schools in the vicinity of Orwell, and attended two years of college at Troy Conference Academy. In 1850, he moved to New York City and engaged in a number of business concerns, returning to Vermont in 1864 and purchasing hundreds of acres of land near Rutland, Vermont with funds from his work in New York. In 1866, Royce organized the Steam-Stone Cutter Company along with W.T. Nichols, employing the steam powered stone cutter recently invented by George J. Wardwell, thus pioneering the industrialization of marble building stone quarrying in Vermont. Royce was also the prime investor in the establishment of the True Blue Marble Company near West Rutland in 1884. In addition to marble quarrying, he was involved with Horace Henry Baxter and Trenor W. Park in the establishment of the Baxter National Bank in Rutland, serving as a founding director from 1870 until his death. He was also a director of the United States Tube Company in Buffalo, New York.
