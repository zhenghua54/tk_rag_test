Other Paris artists took part in the war; the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, for example, went into the army and was seriously wounded in 1916. While recovering in Paris, he wrote "Les Mamelles de Tirésias" and coined the word Surrealism in the program notes for Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie's ballet "Parade". He also published an artistic manifesto, "L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes". The war-weakened Apollinaire died of influenza during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 and was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.
