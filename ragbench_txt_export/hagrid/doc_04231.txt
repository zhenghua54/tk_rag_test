Grubb was a consultant on the first edition of "Unearthed Arcana", and authored the first edition of the "Manual of the Planes". Grubb contacted Ed Greenwood, author of numerous articles in "Dragon" about his home campaign setting, and soon Greenwood began sending Grubb packages full of maps and background information; this collaboration resulted in the publication of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting beginning with the "Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting" (1987). He is the designer of the "Spelljammer" campaign setting, and the Al-Qadim setting. Grubb felt that Al-Qadim was well received because the designers had managed to hide the setting's potential from TSR's executives.
