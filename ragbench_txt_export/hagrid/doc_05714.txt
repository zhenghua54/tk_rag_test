Prions are misfolded proteins which characterize several fatal neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans. It is not known what causes the normal protein to misfold; the abnormal 3-D structure is suspected to confer infectious properties. The word "prion" derives from "proteinaceous infectious particle". Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are hypothesized as the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), including scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (commonly known as "mad cow disease"), and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.
