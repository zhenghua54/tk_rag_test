Mary Allen Wilkes (born September 25, 1937 in Chicago, Illinois) is a former computer programmer and logic designer, most known for her work with the LINC computer, now recognized by many as the world's first "personal computer." Wilkes graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 where she majored in philosophy and theology. At that time she wanted to become a lawyer but was discouraged by friends and mentors because she was a woman. She sought work in the computer field partly because computer programming was a field that was open to women and partly because her geography teacher in the eighth grade had told her during a class discussion, "Mary Allen, when you grow up, you ought to be a computer programmer." She had no idea at the
time what that meant, but she never forgot it. She finally became an attorney in 1975.
