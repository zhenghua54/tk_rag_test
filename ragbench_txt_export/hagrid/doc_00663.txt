In the 1970's, Scott started to experiment with Botox as a therapy for strabismus, due to its muscle relaxing features. In 1978, he received permission from the FDA to test Botox in clinical trials with humans, which was at that time groundbreaking, as Botox in higher dosages could paralyze and ultimately kill humans. After successful clinical trials on patients, the treatment received FDA approval in 1989. Two years later he sold the patent to Allergen for $9M. Allergen which changed the name for Oculinum to Botox. Its 1991 revenue amounted to $13M, as it was solely used for medical treatments. As Allergen conducted further studies with Botox for its cosmetic wrinkle reducing quality, it received FDA approval in 2002. Today, Botox annual revenue is estimated to be more than $2.5B. Scott has published numerous articles on the subject of strabismus. He founded the Strabismus Research Foundation in San Francisco, and continues to conduct research on strabismus and related topics together with Joel M. Miller and Talita Malta e Cunha.
