The location of the conclaves became fixed only in the fourteenth century. Since the end of the Western Schism in 1417, however, elections have always taken place in Rome (except in 1799â€“1800, when French troops occupying Rome forced the election to be held in Venice), and normally in what, since the Lateran Treaties of 1929, has become the independent Vatican City State. Since 1846, when the Quirinal Palace was used, the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has served as the location of the election. Popes have often fine-tuned the rules for the election of their successors: Pope Pius XII's "Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis" (1945) governed the conclave of 1958, Pope John XXIII's "Summi Pontificis electio" (1962) that of 1963, Pope Paul VI's "Romano Pontifici eligendo" (1975) the two conclaves of 1978, John Paul II's "Universi Dominici Gregis" (1996) that of 2005, and two amendments by Benedict XVI (2007, 2013) that of 2013.
