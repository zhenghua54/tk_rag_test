Silver Scorpion (Elizabeth Barstow) first appeared in "Daring Mystery Comics" #7 (April 1941), during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, and was created by Harry Sahle. He signed her origin story with the pen name Jewell, which comics historian Michael J. Vassallo believes marks a collaboration with another, unknown artist. She is Marvel Comics' first superheroine, following the antihero character Black Widow, who reaped evildoers' souls for Satan.
