In the 1940s, CBS Laboratories invented an early color system that utilized a wheel, containing six color filters, rotated in front of a single video camera tube to generate the RGB signal. Called a field-sequential color system, it used interlaced video, with sequentially alternating color video fields to produce one complete video frame. That meant that the first field would be red, the second blue, and the third field green â€“ matching the color filters on the wheel and also in a different order than NTSC. This system was both simpler and more reliable than a standard three-tube color camera, and more power-efficient.
