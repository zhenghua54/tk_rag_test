Silent Hill: Origins is a survival horror video game for the PlayStation Portable developed by Climax Action. It was published by Konami Digital Entertainment worldwide in late 2007, beginning in early November with the United Kingdom. A port for the PlayStation 2 was released worldwide in early 2008, beginning in March with North America. The fifth installment in the "Silent Hill" series, "Origins" is a prequel to the first game (1999). Set in the series' eponymous, fictional American town, "Origins" follows trucker Travis Grady as he searches for information about a girl whom he rescued from a fire. Along the way, he unlocks his repressed childhood memories. Gameplay uses a third-person perspective, and emphasizes combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving, similar to the previous installments.
