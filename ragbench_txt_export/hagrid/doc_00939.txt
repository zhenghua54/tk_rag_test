The Concept of Anxiety (): "A Simple Psychologically Orienting Deliberation on the Dogmatic Issue of Hereditary Sin", is a philosophical work written by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard in 1844. The original 1944 English translation by Walter Lowrie (now out of print), had the title The Concept of Dread. "The Concept of Anxiety" was dedicated "to the late professor Poul Martin Møller". He used the pseudonym Vigilius Haufniensis (which, according to Kierkegaard scholar Josiah Thompson, is the Latin transcription for "the Watchman" of Copenhagen) for "The Concept of Anxiety".
