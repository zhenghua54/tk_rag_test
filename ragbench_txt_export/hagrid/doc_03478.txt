NASCAR itself has a long tradition of Modified racing in the Southeastern U.S. Prior to the formation of todayâ€™s Northeastern-based Whelen Modified Tour in 1985. The evolution of Modified racing began in the late 1940s with the first NASCAR sanctioned race taking place at Daytona beach course in February,1948. Coupes and sedans were the vehicles of choice and provided a new form of entertainment as tracks began spring up all over the country. NASCAR Modified teams competed in championship events up and down the east coast, including stops at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, North Wilkesboro Speedway and Martinsville Speedway. Top drivers from North Carolina and Virginia, such as Ralph Brinkley, Ray Hendrick and Satch Worley, were regular NASCAR Modified competitors.
