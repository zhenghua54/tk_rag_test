Christopher Hitchens was the author of "God Is Not Great" and was named among the "Top 100 Public Intellectuals" by "Foreign Policy" and "Prospect" magazines. In addition, Hitchens served on the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America. In 2010 Hitchens published his memoir "Hitch-22" (a nickname provided by close personal friend Salman Rushdie, whom Hitchens always supported during and following "The Satanic Verses" controversy). Shortly after its publication, Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which led to his death in December 2011. Before his death, Hitchens published a collection of essays and articles in his book "Arguably"; a short edition "Mortality" was published posthumously in 2012. These publications and numerous public appearances provided Hitchens with a platform to remain an astute atheist during his illness, even speaking specifically on the culture of deathbed conversions and condemning attempts to convert the terminally ill, which he opposed as "bad taste".
