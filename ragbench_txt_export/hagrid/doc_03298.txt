After the Battle of Hill 60 (Aprilâ€“May 1915), Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers (RE) took up mining operations under the hill and the neighbouring ground on a much more ambitious scale. Deep mining under the German galleries beneath Hill 60 began in late August 1915, with the 175th Tunnelling Company, which began a gallery behind the British front line and passed beneath the German positions. The British underground works consisted of an access gallery (Berlin Tunnel) leading to two mine chambers, "Hill 60 A" (beneath Hill 60) and "Hill 60 B" (beneath The Caterpillar), to be loaded with explosives and detonated at the appointed time. The 3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company took over in April 1916 and completed the galleries, the Hill 60 mine being charged with explosives in July 1916 and the branch gallery under The Caterpillar in October.
