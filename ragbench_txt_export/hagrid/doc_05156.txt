Imam Ali, played by Emilio Doorgasingh, is the imam at the Masoods' mosque. In July 2009 he speaks to Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) and Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas) about arrangements for their wedding. In September, Syed confides in him that he has feelings for another man, Christian Clarke (John Partridge). He performs Syed and Amira's wedding ceremony on 1 January 2010. In April 2010, Syed's father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) talks to him about Syed's sexuality. Ali tells Masood the family will be shunned by the community if it comes out. In May 2010 he overhears Nadim Abbasi (Kriss Dosanjh) tell Syed he should find another mosque so he tells Masood and his wife Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) that Syed will always be welcome at his mosque. In May 2011, Zainab contacts him and they meet, and she talks about a "friend" who feels her husband has changed. Ali knows she means herself and says that she and Masood have been married for 28 years so it will not always feel the same. In 2013, there is a new imam, also called Ali. The original Imam Ali returns in June 2015, to attend the engagement party of Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami). Later in the month, he attends a charity event for homeless people held at the community centre. In November 2015, he marries Shabnam and Kush.
