Colette's first performance/photo work took place in 1970 when she had herself photographed as "Liberty Leading the People" after Delacroix. She presented this work to the public in 1972. In an installation, composed of white parachute silk, embedded lighting, [lightboxes, lavender-painted floors inscribed with her personal code and audios, she posed as Libert√©. This tableau vivant could also be viewed from the windows of the gallery. Fred McDarrah photographed it for "The Village Voice" in January 1973.
