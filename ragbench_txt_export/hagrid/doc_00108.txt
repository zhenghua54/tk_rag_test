The Mitanni, a people known in eastern Anatolia from about 1500 BC, were of mixed origins: a Hurrian-speaking majority was dominated by a non-Anatolian, Indo-Aryan elite. There is linguistic evidence for such a superstrate, in the form of:
In particular, Kikkuli's text includes words such as "aika" "one" (i.e. a cognate of the Indo-Aryan "eka"), "tera" "three" ("tri"), "panza" "five" ("pancha"), "satta" "seven", ("sapta"), "na" "nine" ("nava"), and "vartana" "turn around", in the context of a horse race (Indo-Aryan "vartana"). In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni, the Ashvin deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya are invoked. These loanwords tend to connect the Mitanni superstrate to Indo-Aryan rather than Iranian languages â€“ i.e. the early Iranian word for "one" was "aiva".
