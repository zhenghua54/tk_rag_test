"Spider-Man" is the theme song of the 1967 cartoon show "Spider-Man", composed by Paul Francis Webster and Robert "Bob" Harris. The original song was recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto (where the cartoon was also produced) featuring 12 CBC vocalists (members of the Billy Van Singers, and Laurie Bower Singers groups) who added to the musical backing track supplied by RCA Studios, New York. The singers were paid only for the session and have had no residuals from its use since then.
