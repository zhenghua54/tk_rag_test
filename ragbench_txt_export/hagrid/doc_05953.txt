Zawisza gave issue 27 4 stars out of 5, saying, ""Forever Doomed" is somewhat predictable with regards to the appearance of the Doom Patrol and the motions Cyborg goes through, but "Justice League" #27 is nowhere near boring. This comic book serves very well as "Doom Patrol" #0 or even "Cyborg" #0 (maybe now Vic Stone will be able to find his way to a solo series) or a companion piece to "Forever Evil," but lacks the Justice League for which this comic is branded." Schedeen said, ""Justice League" #27 offers a change of pace for the series' Forever Evil tie-in storyline. Having explored the origins of the various Crime Syndicate members in previous issues, Geoff Johns now turns his attention back to Earth's dwindling lineup of heroes. As the cover suggests, Cyborg is the star of the show this month, although a handful of other characters put in appearances as well," giving the issue an 8.0 out of 10. David Pepose of Newsarama gave the issue a 7 out of 10, saying, "For those who have been exasperated at the slow pacing of "Forever Evil", well, you probably won't be too thrilled here -- this issue is certainly a detour, although it's one that might mean a lot for a truly underutilized hero (or several). That said, if comics like these are what we need to introduce even more of DC's properties back into the public eye, it's not a tremendous cost -- there's some humanity underneath all that event machinery, and it's nice to see "Justice League" #27 try to find that beating heart."
