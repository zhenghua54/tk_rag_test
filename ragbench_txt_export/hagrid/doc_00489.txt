NBC ordered a full season of "Homicide: Life on the Street" before a pilot episode was even produced. Planned as a mid-season replacement, the network ordered six episodes for their 1993 winter season, and then ordered another three after watching the completed pilot episode. The network had been consistently placing third behind their competitor networks ABC and CBS, and was suffering due to the loss of several successful shows in 1992, including "The Cosby Show", "The Golden Girls" and "Matlock", as well as the upcoming end of "Cheers" in 1993. NBC had tried appealing to audiences in their 20s through several comedies, but those efforts proved unsuccessful and the network decided to focus on high-quality dramas like "Homicide". NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield considered it the most promising new series of the season.
