30 March 2015 was the first time Parliament had ever dissolved automatically, as opposed to being dissolved by Royal Proclamation (although provision was made by the Septennial Act 1715 for Parliament to dissolve automatically after seven, and later five years, in practice dissolution was always effected shortly before the end of the five-year period by means of a Royal Proclamation). Although Prime Minister David Cameron met the Queen on the day of the dissolution, the only business discussed was the calling of the new Parliament, and not a request for a dissolution, as had happened at every such meeting historically, and the subsequent Royal Proclamation made on 30 March simply called for the holding of the next Parliament (and therefore the holding of the general election).
