Shrikes are passerine birds known for their habit of catching other birds and small animals and "impaling the uneaten portions of their bodies on thorns", (creating a larder to attract a female). A typical shrike's beak is hooked, like a bird of prey. There are 31 species worldwide and 3 North American species. The loggerhead shrike is extremely abundant in the "low desert"/ chaparral environment.Order: PasseriformesFamily: Vireonidae
