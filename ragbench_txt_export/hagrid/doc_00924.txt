Most starfish have five arms that radiate from a central disc, but the number varies with the group. Some species have six or seven arms and others have 10â€“15 arms. The Antarctic "Labidiaster annulatus" can have over fifty. Having descended from bilateral organisms, starfish move in a bilateral fashion, with certain arms acting like the front of the animal.
