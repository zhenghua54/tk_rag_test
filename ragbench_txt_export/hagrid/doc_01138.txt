Arkane's "Prey" is largely unrelated to the 2006 game "Prey" developed by Human Head Studios, and is considered a reimagining of the intellectual property set in a wholly new narrative. While "Prey 2", a sequel to the 2006 game, had been planned by Human Head, it fell into development hell following transfer of the intellectual property from 3D Realms to Bethesda Softworks, and was eventually cancelled in 2014. Arkane's game does not use any of the planned sequel's assets, and only incorporates the previous game's name and the broad theme of the protagonist being hunted by aliens. Arkane built "Prey" as a spiritual sequel to "System Shock", providing the player with several potential means of progressing within the game.
