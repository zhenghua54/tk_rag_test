Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces ("il" or "vilayet") for administrative purposes. Each province is divided into districts ("ilçe"), for a total of 923 districts. Turkey is also subdivided into 7 regions ("bölge") and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the "acquis" of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, politics and the broader public.
