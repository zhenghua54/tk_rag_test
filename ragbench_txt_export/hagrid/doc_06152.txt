Boston State College's roots began with the Girls' High School, which was founded in 1852. In 1872, the Boston Normal School separated from Girls' High School and became an independent institution, although it still occupied the building alongside the high school and Girls' Latin School. The Normal School was renamed the Teachers College of the City of Boston in 1924. In 1952, it became a state college, the State Teachers College at Boston. The college was renamed the State College at Boston, also known as Boston State College, in 1960. Boston State College merged with University of Massachusetts Boston in 1982. After the merger, in the mid-1980s, its former main campus, located at 621 Huntington Avenue, was acquired by the Massachusetts College of Art, and serves as that institution's primary campus.
