About the course of the Beagle Channel there were discrepancies. The eastern end of the Channel can be seen as a delta with an east-west arm and a north-south arm (around Navarino Island). The channel specified in the border treaty of 1881 was seen by Chile as the east-west arm, but by Argentina as the north-south arm. Following this controversy, two clauses were in dispute: Chile argued the Channel clause ("... to Chile shall belong all the islands to the south of Beagle Channel up to Cape Horn..."), while Argentina the Atlantic clause ("... the other islands there may be on the Atlantic to the east of Tierra del Fuego ..."). Some Chileans argued that the text ""until it touches the Beagle Channel"" in article III meant that Argentina had no navigable waters in the Beagle Channel, although this interpretation was not supported by the Chilean claim.
