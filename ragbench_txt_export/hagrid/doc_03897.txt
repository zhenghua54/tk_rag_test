Zuni sits on the banks of the Blackwater River, which separates Isle of Wight County with Southampton County. In 1999 Zuni was flooded by Hurricane Floyd and flooded again in 2006, causing the river to overflow and completely cover the bridge crossing the river. When the river overflows it floods many homes in the Zuni area.
