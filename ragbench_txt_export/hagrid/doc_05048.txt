Hard disk drives store data in the magnetic polarization of small patches of the surface coating on a disk. The maximum areal density is defined by the size of the magnetic particles in the surface, as well as the size of the "head" used to read and write the data. The areal density of disk storage devices has increased dramatically since IBM introduced the IBM 350 disk storage, the first hard disk drive in 1956 at an areal density of 2,000 bit/in. The growth rate has matched Moore's Law with the density reaching 1 Tbit/in in 2014. In 2015, Seagate introduced a hard drive at a density of 1.34 Tbit/in, about 600 million times that of the first disk drive. It is expected that current recording technology can be "feasibly" expected to scale to at least 5 Tbit/in in the near future. New technologies like Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and Microwave Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) are under development and are expected to continue magnetic areal density progress.
