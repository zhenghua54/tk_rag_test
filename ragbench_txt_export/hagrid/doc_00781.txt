Thailand and Vietnam has agreed to a continental shelf boundary, with "Point C" as the eastern terminus of their common continental shelf border. This point (with coordinates 07° 48' 00" N, 103° 02' 30" E) coincides with Point 43 in the 1979 map produced by Malaysia's Mapping and Survey Department depicting the country's territorial sea and continental shelf claims. In Malaysia's perspective, Point 43/Point C would be the common tripoint for Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, and thus the westernmost terminus of the Malaysia-Vietnam common border. Thailand and Vietnam do not recognise this position as they does not recognise Malaysia's continental shelf boundary asserted in the 1979 map.
