Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie flee from Harrenhal. They are surprised by the sudden appearance of the mysterious assassin Jaqen H'ghar, who helped them escape. Jaqen offers to take Arya with him to Braavos to train her in his abilities. Although tempted, Arya declines, intending to reunite with her family. Before departing, Jaqen hands Arya a special coin and the phrase ""Valar morghulis"," which Arya may use to seek him if she meets anyone from Braavos. Before departing, Jaqen turns to reveal he has changed his face, an ability of the "Faceless Men" he mentions to Arya.
