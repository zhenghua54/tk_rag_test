French Braille is the original braille alphabet, and the basis of all others. The alphabetic order of French has become the basis of the international braille convention, used by most braille alphabets around the world. However, only the 25 basic letters of the French alphabet plus "w" have become internationalized; the additional letters are largely restricted to French Braille and the alphabets of some neighboring European countries.
