Bethany Britney Platt, played by Lucy Fallon, made her first appearance on 4 June 2000. Amy and Emily Walton shared the role of Bethany Platt from the character's birth in 2000 until 2007 when Tina O'Brien chose to quit. Mia Cookson also played the role of Bethany alongside the Walton twins in 2000. On 23 October 2014, it was announced that Bethany, now 14 years old, would return to the show. Katie Redford was initially cast in the role, but was sacked just days later before filming began after it was revealed that she was 25 years old, not 19 as she and her management had claimed. On 29 January Blackpool-born Lucy Fallon was confirmed as her replacement. She returned on 20 March 2015. Bethany's storylines have included her taking ecstasy tablets when her uncle, David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) hid them in a toy, her infatuation with Callum Logan as well as being caught up with her family's feud with Callum.
