First described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century, no separate varieties of "Banksia menziesii" are recognised. It is found in Western Australia, from the Perth (32° S) region north to the Murchison River (27° S), and generally grows on sandy soils, in scrubland or low woodland. "Banksia menziesii" provides food for a wide array of invertebrate and vertebrate animals; birds and in particular honeyeaters are prominent visitors. A relatively hardy plant, "Banksia menziesii" is commonly seen in gardens, nature strips and parks in Australian urban areas with Mediterranean climates, but its sensitivity to dieback from the soil-borne water mould "Phytophthora cinnamomi" makes it short-lived in places with humid summers, such as Sydney. "Banksia menziesii" is widely used in the cut flower industry both in Australia and overseas.
