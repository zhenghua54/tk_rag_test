The foundation work for "Xenoblade Chronicles X" provided a base architecture upon which the staff were able to build for the next "Xeno" game for the Nintendo Switch, resulting in a far shorter development time than previous "Xenoblade" titles. The next game, titled "Xenoblade Chronicles 2" and released worldwide on December 1, 2017, acts as a thematic sequel to "Xenoblade Chronicles", shifting back to a story-driven approach after the focus on gameplay for "Xenoblade Chronicles X". Elma was released as a "Blade" or sentient weapon for the expansion pass of "Xenoblade Chronicles 2".
