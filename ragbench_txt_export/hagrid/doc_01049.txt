Sophia Antonopoulou developed this critique of Marx and Marxism in her book "The Marxist Theory of Development and its Convergence with the Bourgeois Theoretical Paradigm" (Papazissis, Athens, 1991) (in Greek), in which she criticizes the theoretical model that Marx had developed with respect to the economy, society and history, as well as Marx’s philosophical theory (Dialectical and Historical Materialism). The conclusion she arrives at is that Marxism did not fail as an alternative to the bourgeois theoretical and political paradigm, but, on the contrary, because it did not succeed in the formulation of such an alternative paradigm. She considers that Marxism, and Marx himself, constitutes a peculiar type of bourgeois thought and that it is not accidental that Marxist theory led to the creation of “state capitalism” in the former USSR.
