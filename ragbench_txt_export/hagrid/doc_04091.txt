Clouds of the genus stratus form in low horizontal layers having a ragged or uniform base. Ragged stratus often forms in precipitation while more uniform stratus forms in maritime or other moist stable air mass conditions. The latter often produces drizzle. Stratus that touches the Earth's surface is given the common name, fog, rather than a Latin name that applies only to clouds that form and remain aloft in the troposphere."Cloud types are sorted in alphabetical order except where noted".
The division of genus types into species is as shown in the following table. The species are sorted from left to right in approximate ascending order of instability or vertical extent. The genus types are arranged from top to bottom in the same ascending order of instability within each Ã©tage. (1)=Stratiform types, (2)=Cirriform types, (3)=Stratocumuliform types, (4)=Cumuliform types, (5)=Cumulonimbiform types.
Vert=Vertical or multi-level, MV=Moderate or deep vertical, TV=Towering vertical.
