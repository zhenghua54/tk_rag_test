Recruited to the Magpies in 2000 by Collingwood president Eddie McGuire, Malthouse coached Collingwood to the finals in eight out of his twelve seasons as coach including grand final appearances in 2002, 2003, 2010 (twice) and 2011. In 2010, after the first drawn AFL/VFL grand final since 1977, Collingwood claimed premiership success with a resounding 56-point win over St Kilda in the replay. This was the club's biggest ever win in a grand final and the first since 1990. In July 2009, McGuire produced a succession plan in which Malthouse was to hand over the coaching reins to club legend Nathan Buckley at the end of the 2011 season. In 2011, Malthouse guided Collingwood to another grand final against the Geelong Cats. After the dramatic three point win over Hawthorn in a preliminary final, he was shown on TV in tears in the coach's box after his side came from 17 points down at the final change to book their place in Malthouse's fifth grand final as Collingwood coach and his eighth overall. Collingwood lost the 2011 AFL Grand Final to Geelong by 38 points. The game was his final one as Collingwood coach. Malthouse advised that he would not be taking on the position as Director of Coaching at Collingwood after the loss and that he had made this decision six weeks earlier. In addition, while coaching Collingwood, Malthouse spent time as a guest media commentator for SEN 1116.
