Major Alfred Whitmore (1876â€“1946) was an English pathologist who, together with C.S. Krishnaswami, identified "Burkholderia pseudomallei", the causative agent of melioidosis (also known as "Whitmore's disease") in opium addicts in Rangoon in 1911. He differentiated it from "Burkholderia mallei", the causative agent of glanders, by clinical and microbiological features.
