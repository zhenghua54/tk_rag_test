Botulinum toxin produced by "Clostridium botulinum" is the cause of botulism. Humans most commonly ingest the toxin from eating improperly-canned foods in which "C. botulinum" has grown. However, the toxin can also be introduced through an infected wound. In infants, the bacteria can sometimes grow in the intestines and produce botulinum toxin within the intestine and can cause a condition known as floppy baby syndrome. In all cases, the toxin can then spread, blocking nerves and muscle function. In severe cases, the toxin can block nerves controlling the respiratory system or heart, resulting in death.
