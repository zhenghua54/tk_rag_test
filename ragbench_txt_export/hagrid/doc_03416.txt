No further downloadable content for either "Guitar Hero" or "DJ Hero" was made after February 2011, though Activision committed to releasing content that was already in development by that time due to fan response; later, in a move described by "Game Informer" as "the final nail in [the series'] coffins", Activision announced it would discontinue all DLC sales for the series without revoking access to tracks already bought as of March 31, 2014. Though Activision had moved away from the "Guitar Hero" series, the lessons learned helped them and developer Toys for Bob to handle the manufacturing and outsourcing issues that came with the highly successful "Skylanders" toy and video game franchise.
