Sun Yat-sen was born on November 12, 1866, into a farming peasant household in Choyhung in Kwangtung near the Portuguese colony of Macao. His early education established him as a man of two worlds: China and the West. After a basic training in the Chinese classics in his village school, he was sent to Hawaii in 1879 to join his older brother. There he enrolled in a college where he studied Western science and Christianity. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Republic of China, died in Beijing in 1925. Read more: Sun Yat-sen Biography
