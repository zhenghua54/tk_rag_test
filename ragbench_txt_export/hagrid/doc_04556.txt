After Honolulu, Hawaii's KIKU-TV had success with "Android Kikaider" (marketed as "Kikaida") and "Kamen Rider V3" in the 1970s, multiple Super Sentai Series, including "Himitsu Sentai Gorenger" and "Battle Fever J", were brought to the Hawaiian market, broadcast in Japanese with English subtitles by JN Productions. In 1985, Marvel Comics produced a pilot for an American adaptation of "Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan", but the show was rejected by the major US TV networks. In 1986, Saban Productions produced a pilot for an American adaptation of "Choudenshi Bioman" titled "Bio Man". In 1987, some episodes of "Kagaku Sentai Dynaman" were dubbed and aired as a parody on the USA Network television show "Night Flight".
