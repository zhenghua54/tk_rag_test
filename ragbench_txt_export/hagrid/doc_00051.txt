"Smilodon" lived during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago), and was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats. "Smilodon" probably lived in a closed habitat such as forest or bush. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. In North America, the varied habitat supported other saber-toothed cats in addition to "Smilodon", such as "Homotherium" and "Xenosmilus"; the habitat here varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless mammoth steppes in the north. "Smilodon" inhabited the temperate latitudes of North America, where the mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in the southwest supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Other large carnivores included dire wolves, short-faced bear ("Arctodus simus") and the American lion. Due to competition from larger carnivores in North America, "S. fatalis" was perhaps not able to attain the same size as "S. populator". The similar sizes of "S. fatalis" and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.
