Researchers have investigated the relationship between posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD). 282 outpatients, who were an average of 53 days post-TBI in their recovery, were divided into four groups: PTA episode lasting less than one hour; PTA episode lasting between one hour and 24 hours; PTA episode lasting between 24 hours and one week; and PTA episode lasting for longer than one week. The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two self-report inventories: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location). The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health. The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than one hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.
