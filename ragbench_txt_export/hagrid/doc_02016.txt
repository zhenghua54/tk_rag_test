Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in South America, with 45% of its population living below the poverty line. Poverty is a major cause of child labor in Bolivia, and children from poor families work in order to support the well-being of their families and to supply their basic needs of survival. Low living standards combined with low educational attainment increases poverty rates and the prevalence of child labor. UNICEF reports that a familyâ€™s access to financial credit influences the likelihood of children working, as greater access to financial credit reduces the chances of children working, and of children working in more dangerous occupations.
