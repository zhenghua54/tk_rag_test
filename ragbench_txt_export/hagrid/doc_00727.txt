Wagner began composing the music for "Das Rheingold" between November 1853 and September 1854, following it immediately with "Die Walk√ºre" (written between June 1854 and March 1856). He began work on the third "Ring" opera, which he now called simply "Siegfried," probably in September 1856, but by June 1857 he had completed only the first two acts. He decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea: "Tristan und Isolde," based on the Arthurian love story "Tristan and Iseult." One source of inspiration for "Tristan und Isolde" was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his "The World as Will and Representation," to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer for the rest of his life.
