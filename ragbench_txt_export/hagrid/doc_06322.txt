The US is ranked third in production volume of wheat, with almost 58 million tons produced in the 2012â€“2013 growing season, behind only China and India (But the combined production of all European Union nations is larger than that of China). The US is ranked first in crop export volume; almost 50% of its total wheat production is exported.
