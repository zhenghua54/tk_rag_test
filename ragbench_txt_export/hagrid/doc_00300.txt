Hosseini was born on March 4, 1965 in Kabul, Afghanistan, the eldest of five children. His father, Nasser worked as a diplomat for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul while his mother worked as a Persian language teacher at a girls high school; both originate from Herat. Regarding his ethnicity, Hosseini stated, "I'm not pure anything ... There's a Pashtun part of me, a Tajik part of me." His mother's family is believed to be from the Mohammadzai tribe of Pashtuns. Hosseini describes his upbringing as privileged. He spent eight years of his childhood in the middle class Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood in Kabul. Hosseini does not recall his sister, Raya, ever suffering discrimination for being a female. Kabul itself was "a growing, thriving, cosmopolitan city" where he regularly flew kites with a number of cousins.
