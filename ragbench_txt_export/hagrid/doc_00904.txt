The Metropolitan Toronto School Board, a "super-ordinate umbrella board" created in 1953 to coordinate activities and to apportion tax revenues equitably across the school boards within Metro Toronto, was dissolved at this time, with its functions merged into the new board. The Metropolitan Toronto School Board's head office was located at the former York Mills Public School site on Campbell Crescent (built 1956 and demolished 2004).
