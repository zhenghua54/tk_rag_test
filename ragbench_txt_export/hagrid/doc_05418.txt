Zac tries to support Leah when the courts decide to give custody of Billie's daughter Luc to Ash. Despite his acts of goodwill, Leah is convinced their marriage is at breaking point and files for divorce, much to Zac's shock and disbelief. Zac continually tries to win her back but his attempts prove futile and he fails. After having a chat and a drink with Nate Cooper, Zac ends up drunk and heads over to Leah's. He climbs onto the roof and Roo and Leah watch him in shock. After making a heartwarming speech to Leah that he will always love her, Zac trips and falls from the roof, sustaining near fatal injuries. He is rushed into hospital afterwards and manages to make a full recovery. Hunter visits him whilst he is resting and Zac makes a remark about when he and Charlotte broke up, causing Hunter to question whether Zac is really his father. Zac eventually finds out about the test and reassures Hunter that he is his father by telling him that he and Charlotte were in an on-off relationship around the time of his conception, ridding Hunter of all doubt. Hunter bins the test but curiosity takes him over and he reads it, finding out that Zac is in fact not his father. Zac goes to leave the bay, wanting to take Hunter with him, but Hunter tells him he is not his father and convinces him to just leave the Bay. With his marriage to Leah no longer functional and hit by Hunter not being his son, Zac then leaves for his new teaching post in Vietnam to join Evie and Matt.
