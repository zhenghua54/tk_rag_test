In 2010, Burrell and Chef Beau MacMillan hosted a Food Network reality series named "Worst Cooks in America". Burrell and her co-host lead contestants through a "culinary boot camp" on their journey to become better cooks. The first season premiered on January 3, 2010. Chef Burrell won the challenge when her recruit, Rachel Coleman, edged out MacMillan's recruit, Jenny Cross.
