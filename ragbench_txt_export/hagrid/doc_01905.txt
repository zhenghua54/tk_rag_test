In the early-21st century live-action film trilogy directed by Michael Bay, Cybertron is depicted much in the same way as in the source material: the homeplanet of the Transformer race. As described in the first film, the AllSpark is the origin of life in Cybertron, and over millennia, its population grew and developed a global state, peaceful and just, remaining so for eons until the war for possession of the AllSpark broke out. The war was so devastating that it ravaged the planet until it was consumed by death, and the only way to restore Cybertron to its former glory was through the retrieval of the AllSpark, which is the premise from which the film series start and progress to its climax.
