Whilst studying at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, the young Dr. Sun constantly travelled between Hong Kong and Macau to criticise the corruption of the Qing regime and agitated for revolution to save the country. He, along with Chan Siu-bak, Yau Lit and Yeung Hok-ling, were known as the "Si Da Kou" (Four Bandits). During this period, Sun Yat-Sen made many revolutionary statements and his first great essay—"Letter to Zheng Zaoru"—in his anthology was published by a Macau newspaper in 1890.
