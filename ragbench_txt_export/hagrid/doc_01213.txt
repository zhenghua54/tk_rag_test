Modern day fracking equipment is capable of pumping anywhere from 800-4200 gallons of water per minute, at pressures ranging from 500-20,000+ psi. Once the injection process is complete and gas has entered the well, anywhere between 10 and 30 percent of the fluid injected will flow back into the well as wastewater for disposal.  In addition to the chemical additives present in fracking fluid, flowback water contains dangerous volatile hydrocarbons, such as hydrogen sulfide pulled from the fractured rock. Workers must use handheld gauges to check fluid levels via hatches on top of wells and when doing so they may be exposed to dangerous plumes of gas and vapor containing the volatile hydrocarbons.  Exposure to these chemicals and hydrocarbons can affect the nervous system, heart rhythms, and may lead to asphyxiation or death.
