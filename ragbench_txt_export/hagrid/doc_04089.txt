The list of cloud types groups the tropospheric types as "high" (cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus), "middle" (altocumulus, altostratus), "multi-level" (nimbostratus, cumulus, cumulonimbus), and "low" (stratocumulus, stratus) according to the altitude level or levels at which each cloud is normally found. Small cumulus are commonly grouped with the low clouds because they do not show significant vertical extent. Of the multi-level genus-types, those with the greatest convective activity are often grouped separately as "towering vertical". The genus types all have Latin names.
