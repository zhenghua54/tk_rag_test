Hong Kong Cantonese () is a dialect of the Cantonese language commonly spoken in Hong Kong, as well as Macau. Although the Hong Kong people largely identify this variant of Chinese with the term ""Cantonese"" (), a variety of publications in Mainland China describe the variant as "Hong Kong speech" ().
