Fighter-bombers became increasingly important in the 1950s and 1960s, as new jet engines dramatically improved the power of even the smallest fighter designs. Many aircraft initially designed as fighters or interceptors found themselves in the fighter-bomber role at some point in their career. Notable among these is the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, first designed as a high-performance day fighter and then adapted to the nuclear strike role for European use. Another such aircraft was the Indian HAL HF-24 Marut. It was used during the Indo-Pak war of 1971, and only three aircraft were lost to ground fire. One aerial kill recorded by Marut flown by Squadron Leader K.K. Bakshi of 220 Squadron shot down a PAF F-86 Sabre on 7 Dec 71 (Flag Officer Hamid Khwaja of 15 Squadron PAF). Other U.S. examples include the North American F-100 Super Sabre and (perhaps most famously) the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, each of which were widely used during the Vietnam War.
