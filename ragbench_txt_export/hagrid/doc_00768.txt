Formed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the "Steam Railway" to differentiate it from the Manx Electric Railway, operated by the same department. It was marketed as "Isle of Man Railway" until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the "Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited", reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When nationalised in 1978 it fell under the banner of "Isle of Man Railways", along with the Manx Electric Railway. Re-branding to "Isle of Man Passenger Transport" took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to "Isle of Man Railways" from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as "Isle of Man Transport". The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the "Isle of Man Railway". In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as "Isle of Man Heritage Railways", although the "heritage" tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the "Steam Railway" in marketing material.
