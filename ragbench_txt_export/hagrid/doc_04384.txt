Tara Strong reprised her role as Barbara Gordon for the animated film adaptation of "Batman: The Killing Joke". Her Batgirl costume resembles the one from "The New Batman Adventures" and her debut appearance in "Detective Comics" #359. Batgirl's role in the film was expanded from the source material, including depicting her decision to retire as Batgirl just before the Joker's attack after a tense case with a ruthless gang leader, as well as an encounter with Batman that ended with them having sex. There is also a post-credits scene where Barbara, some time after recovering in the hospital, now operates as Oracle. Barbara's role and portrayal in the film (which differs heavily from most other portrayals) has been heavily criticized as "cheap, misogynistic writing".
