On 30 September 1935, a station, originally named Tinsley Green, was opened at a location only south of the present station. Within a single year of having opened, it was renamed "Gatwick Airport", following the completion of the nearby Beehive airport terminal, which had a direct connection to the station. During 1940, the airport was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force (RAF) for military use. In 1952, the British government decided that the facility would be expanded to form London's second airport. The station continued to be operation until 27 May 1958, the same day upon which the present Gatwick Airport station (above) was opened. The old Gatwick Airport station, following a discontinuation of services, was later demolished. In the present day, the only visible remains of the old station are sections of the former up slow line platform; sections of the connecting subway between the station and the original terminal building, The Beehive, have also survived.
