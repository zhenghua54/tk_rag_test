He was named after Japan's 41st Prime Minister Takeo Miki after Spikes' parents saw a news report. Miki's successor, who was appointed the nation's 42th Prime Minister on December 24, 1976, a week after Takeo was born, was also a Takeo (Fukuda). Takeo's younger cousin Brandon Spikes is currently a free agent.
