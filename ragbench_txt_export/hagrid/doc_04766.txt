Naypyidaw, officially spelled Nay Pyi Taw (; , formerly known as "Kyetpyay, Pyinmana" or "Kyatpyay, Pyinmana"), is the capital city of Myanmar and seat of the government of Myanmar. It is administered as the Naypyidaw Union Territory, as per the Constitution. It is unusual among Myanmar's cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state or region, similar to Canberra in Australia, Bras√≠lia in Brazil, Washington, D.C. in the United States and Islamabad in Pakistan.
