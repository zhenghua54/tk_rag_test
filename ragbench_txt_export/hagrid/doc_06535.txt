The word "Anschluss" is properly translated as "joinder," "connection," "unification," or "political union." In contrast, the German word "Annektierung" (military annexation) was not, and is not commonly used now, to describe the union of Austria and Germany in 1938. The word "Anschluss" had been widespread before 1938 describing an incorporation of Austria into Germany. Calling the incorporation of Austria into Germany an "Anschluss," that is a "unification" or "joinder," was also part of the propaganda used in 1938 by Nazi Germany to create the impression that the union was not coerced. Hitler described the incorporation of Austria as a "Heimkehr", a return to its original home. The word "Anschluss" has endured since 1938, despite being a euphemism for what took place.
