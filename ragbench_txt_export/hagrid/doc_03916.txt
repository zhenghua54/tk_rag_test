After the abolition of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Empire in 1826, military organizations called "Asâkir-i Muntazâma-i Mansûre", "Asâkir-i Muntazâma-i Hâssa", and, in 1834, "Asâkir-i Redîfe" were established to deliver security and public order services in Anatolia and in some provinces of Rumelia.
Since the term Gendarmerie was noticed only in the Assignment Decrees published in the years following the declaration of Tanzimat in 1839, it is assumed that the Gendarmerie organization was founded after that year, but the exact date of foundation has not yet been determined. Therefore, taking the June 14 of "June 14, 1869", on which "Asâkir-i Zaptiye Nizâmnâmesi" was adopted, June 14, 1839 was accepted as the foundation date of the Turkish Gendarmerie.
