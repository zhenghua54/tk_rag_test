That year, the producers of ABC-TV's successful situation comedy "Happy Days" decided to replace its theme song, Bill Haley and the Comets' "Rock Around the Clock", with a new song written especially for the show. The tune was written by Norman Gimbel and Charles Fox, who also wrote themes for "Love, American Style", "Wonder Woman", "Laverne & Shirley", and "The Love Boat". Omartian was chosen to produce the song, and he recommended Pratt & McClain to record it. Multiple short arrangements were produced for the show and its promotional vehicles, and a full-length version was recorded for popular release.
