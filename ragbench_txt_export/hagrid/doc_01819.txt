The Orwell Lady (originally New Mary Louise.) is a purpose built river cruiser (built 1979) currently operating 13 miles of the river Orwell and sails from Ipswich, England. The Orwell lady is 57 ft (17.13m) long and 14 ft (4.26m) in the beam, weighs 42 tonnes, and carries 118 passengers plus crew. The Orwell Lady sails from Ipswich dock and sails to the end of the Orwell at the Port of Felixstowe allowing for views of Shotley harbour and the historic town of Harwich. The boat has a fully functioning bar and panoramic views which has helped secure the boat as a popular tourist attraction in Ipswich. In recent years the boat has become one of the most popular river cruises in East Anglia.
