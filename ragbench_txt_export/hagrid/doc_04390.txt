Sometimes drugs are formulated in an inactive form that is designed to break down inside the body to form the active drug. These are called prodrugs. The reasons for this type of formulation may be because the drug is more stable during manufacture and storage as the prodrug form, or because the prodrug is better absorbed by the body or has superior pharmacokinetics (e.g., lisdexamphetamine).
