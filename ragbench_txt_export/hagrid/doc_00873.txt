Wright was born in Seattle, Washington to Frederick Wiederrecht, a plumber, electrician and handyman, who was also a tenor, and Lucile Wright (c. 1900–1976). She was raised in Duvall, Washington, where she began to study singing and piano with her maternal grandmother, Cora Wright (1874–1951), a pianist, singer and music teacher. Wright moved to Seattle in her teens and graduated from Franklin High School. At the age of seventeen, Wright began to sing on the radio in and around Seattle and attended the University of Washington for two years. Wright also began to sing opera at the same time, including in Mozart's "The Abduction from the Seraglio" and "The Magic Flute". She then joined a touring company in the chorus of "Up in Central Park".
