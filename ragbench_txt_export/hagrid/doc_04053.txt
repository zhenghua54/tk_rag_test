Power Rangers is an American entertainment and merchandising franchise built around a live-action superhero television series, based on the Japanese tokusatsu franchise "Super Sentai". Produced first by Saban Entertainment, second by BVS Entertainment, later by SCG Power Rangers and today by Hasbro, the "Power Rangers" television series takes much of its footage from the "Super Sentai" television series, produced by Toei Company. The first "Power Rangers" entry, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers", debuted on August 28, 1993, and helped launch the Fox Kids programming block of the 1990s, during which it catapulted into popular culture along with a line of action figures and other toys by Bandai. By 2001, the media franchise had generated over $6 billion in toy sales.
