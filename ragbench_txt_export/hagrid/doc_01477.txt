The Lutheran movement had its origins in Germany, where Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation when he published his Ninety-five Theses in 1517. The movement quickly gained great influence in Denmark, although humanists like Poul Helgesen long tried to maintain a reform movement within the Catholic Church instead of abolishing it altogether as the Lutherans would.
