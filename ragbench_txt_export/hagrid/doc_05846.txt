From 1901 to 1949, the House consisted of either 74 or 75 members (the Senate had 36). Between 1949 and 1984, it had between 121 and 127 members (the Senate had 60 until 1975, when it increased to 64).

In 1984, both the Senate and the House were enlarged; since then the House has had between 148 and 150 members (the Senate has 76).
