In the 2010 video game "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors", the main characters were all put onto a sinking ship by a mysterious person named Zero. In their introduction, Zero references the "Titanic"s sinking in the line "On April 14, 1912... the famous ocean liner "Titanic" crashed into an iceberg. After remaining afloat for 2 hours and 40 minutes, it sank beneath the waters of the North Atlantic. I will give you more time. 9 hours is the amount of time you will be given to escape." It is later discovered that the "ship" they are on is a replica of one of "Titanic"s sister ships, the Gigantic. In real life, "Gigantic" was rumored to have been the original name of the HMHS "Britannic", which was one of the "Titanic"s sister ships.
