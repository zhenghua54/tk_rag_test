Mary Badham had no film acting experience before being cast in "To Kill a Mockingbird". The Oscar in her category went to another child actress, Patty Duke for "The Miracle Worker". During filming, Badham became particularly close to actor Gregory Peck, who played Scout's father, Atticus Finch; she kept in touch with him, always calling him 'Atticus', until his death in 2003.
