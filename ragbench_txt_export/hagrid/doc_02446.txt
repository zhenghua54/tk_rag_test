While working on "Final Fantasy XV", Tabata decided to make a high-definition remaster of "Type-0" for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, "Final Fantasy Type-0 HD" was originally announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After "Type-0"s release, Tabata stated in an interview that he wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for "Type-1", "Type-2" and "Type-3" were registered shortly after the "Type-0" trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a protective measure. During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on "Type-1" after completing "XV", and later explained the conceptual "Type" series as a means of publishing "Final Fantasy" games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the "Type" series if "Type-0 HD" was commercially successful.
