In 2001, there was an attempt to revive the "Bonanza" concept with a prequel, "Ponderosa" – not to be confused with the 1972 summer reruns under the same title – with a pilot directed by Simon Wincer and filmed in Australia. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam was a teenager and Joe a little boy, the series lasted 20 episodes and featured less gunfire and brawling than the original. "Bonanza" creator David Dortort approved PAX TV (now Ion TV)'s decision to hire Beth Sullivan, formerly of "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman", which some believe gave the series more depth as well as a softer edge. The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook but also a family counselor and herbal healer. The series takes place in Nevada Territory in 1849, which is actually an anachronism. The Nevada Territory did not split from the Utah Territory until 1861, meaning that until at least the 5th season (the episode "Enter Thomas Bowers" establishes that year as 1857), "Bonanza" is also set in what in real life would have been Utah Territory.
