The museum is currently housed in the Northern Triangle Building, to the immediate north of Emirates Stadium, the club's home ground. It had been previously housed inside the North Bank Stand of Arsenal's Highbury stadium from the stand's opening in 1993 to 2006, when Highbury was closed and redeveloped. It currently attracts over 120,000 visitors a year.
