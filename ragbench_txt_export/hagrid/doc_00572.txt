The town is governed by a Town Supervisor, which is a similar position to that of a Mayor, and four councilmembers elected on an at-large basis. There is also a Town Clerk and Receiver of Taxes, both duly elected. All of the elected officials serve staggered four year terms that are up for election in odd years, except when special elections are held pursuant to state law. The current supervisor is Angie Carpenter, a Republican, who was formerly the Suffolk County Treasurer. She succeeded Tom Croci after he was elected to the New York State Senate in 2015.
