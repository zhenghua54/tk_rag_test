In 2001, Tetsuo Hara began working on a "Fist of the North Star" prequel titled "Fist of the Blue Sky", which was serialized in "Weekly Comic Bunch" until 2010. Set during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1935, the story stars Hokuto Shinken predecessor and Kenshiro's namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi. An English adaptation of "Fist of the Blue Sky" was published in North America by Gutsoon! Entertainment in the now-defunct manga anthology "Raijin Comics". Four collected volumes were published before the company went out of business.
