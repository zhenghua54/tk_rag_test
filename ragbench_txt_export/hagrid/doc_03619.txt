Plymouth has the historical distinction of being the site of the second-largest battle in North Carolina and its last Confederate victory, the Battle of Plymouth (1864), during the American Civil War. The Confederate ironclad warship CSS "Albemarle" — and its eventual sinking on October 27, 1864 while moored at a dock in Plymouth — are the centerpieces of this history.
