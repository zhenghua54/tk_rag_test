All of the lanthanides form LnQ (Q= S, Se, Te). The sesquisulfides can be produced by reaction of the elements or (with the exception of EuS) sulfidizing the oxide (LnO) with HS. The sesquisulfides, LnS generally lose sulfur when heated and can form a range of compositions between LnS and LnS. The sesquisulfides are insulators but some of the LnS are metallic conductors (e.g. CeS) formulated (Ln) (S) (e), while others (e.g. EuS and SmS) are semiconductors. Structurally the sesquisulfides adopt structures that vary according to the size of the Ln metal. The lighter and larger lanthanides favoring 7-coordinate metal atoms, the heaviest and smallest lanthanides (Yb and Lu) favoring 6 coordination and the rest structures with a mixture of 6 and 7 coordination. Polymorphism is common amongst the sesquisulfides. The colors of the sesquisulfides vary metal to metal and depend on the polymorphic form. The colors of the γ-sesquisulfides are LaS, white/yellow; CeS, dark red; PrS, green; NdS, light green; GdS, sand; TbS, light yellow and DyS, orange. The shade of γ-CeS can be varied by doping with Na or Ca with hues ranging from dark red to yellow, and CeS based pigments are used commercially and are seen as low toxicity substitutes for cadmium based pigments.
