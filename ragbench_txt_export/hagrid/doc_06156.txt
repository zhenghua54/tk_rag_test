Like other Boston College athletic teams, BC ruggers are called the Boston College Eagles. With over 90 members, BC Rugby is one of the largest athletic teams at Boston College.
The Boston College Rugby Football Club (BCRFC) founded in 1968, has an impressive 48-year history on the pitch, in the classroom, and after graduation. With league play every fall and tournaments during the spring, BCRFC fields three sides – A, B, and Developmental – with over 80 players participating each year. BCRFC nears its 50th Anniversary and has produced All Americans as well as players for the USA Eagles national team. The Eagles compete in the East Coach Rugby Conference each fall, against rivals AIC, Northeastern, Dartmouth, Fairfield, and UMass. Since 2013, Robert Conway has been the head coach of the Eagles.
