Museum Tower is the 15th-tallest structure in Dallas, tied with both the Reunion Tower and Cityplace Center in height. Among all-residential buildings in Dallas it is surpassed in height only by the Republic Center Tower I, with its spire. However, if measuring by roof height, and thereby excluding the Republic Center Tower I's spire, Museum Tower is taller. It also breaks the record for the highest residence in Dallas, surpassing the Republic I. The Museum Tower is the 4th-tallest building in Dallas' Arts District, behind Chase Tower, Fountain Place, and the Trammell Crow Center; with Bank Of America Plaza being the tallest building in Dallas.
