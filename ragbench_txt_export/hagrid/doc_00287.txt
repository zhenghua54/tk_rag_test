Albright was raised Roman Catholic, but converted to Episcopalianism at the time of her marriage in 1959. Albright's parents had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941, during Albright's early childhood. When "The Washington Post" reported on Albright's Jewish heritage shortly after she had become Secretary of State in 1997, Albright called the report a "'major surprise.'" Albright has stated that she did not learn until age 59 that her parents were originally Jewish and that as many as a dozen of her Jewish relatives in Czechoslovakia—including three of her grandparents—had died in the Holocaust.
