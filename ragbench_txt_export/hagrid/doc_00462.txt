James Thomas Aubrey Jr. (December 14, 1918 – September 3, 1994) was an American television and film executive. President of the CBS television network from 1959 to 1965, he put some of television's most enduring series on the air, including "Gilligan's Island" and "The Beverly Hillbillies". Under Aubrey, CBS dominated American television the way General Motors and General Electric dominated their industries. "The New York Times Magazine" in 1964 called Aubrey "a master of programming whose divinations led to successes that are breathtaking".
