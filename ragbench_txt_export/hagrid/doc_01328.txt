The speciedaler (or specie-dollar) was the currency of Norway between 1816 and 1875. It replaced the rigsdaler specie at par and was subdivided into 5 marks or 120 "skilling" (called skilling "species" on some issues), each mark therefore subdivided into 24 skillings. It was replaced by the Norwegian krone when Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union. An equal valued krone/krona of the monetary union replaced the three currencies at the rate of 1 krone/krona = Danish rigsdaler = Norwegian speciedaler = 1 Swedish riksdaler.
