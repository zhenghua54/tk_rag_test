When he later regains consciousness, Dexter begins investigating Hannah, and finds that she has changed her name and married Miles Foster (Julian Sands), a wealthy businessman. Dexter goes to see Hannah, who says that she had wanted him to kill Foster, but changed her mind after realizing she is still in love with Dexter. Foster warns him to stay away from Hannah, and has him beaten up. Dexter goes to Foster's boat to protect Hannah, but finds that she has already killed him. The two of them dispose of the body, and promise to watch out for each other. The two end up having sex and rekindle their relationship.
