At low pH, many metal ions exist in aqueous solution as aqua coordination complexes, often with the formula [M(HO)]. As the pH increases, one O-H bond ionizes to give the hydroxide complex, the conjugate base of the parent hexaaqua complex: The hydroxo complex is poised to undergo olation, which is initiated by displacement of one water by a neighboring complex: In this product, the hydroxide ligand bridges between the two metals, this bridge is denoted with the symbol Î¼. In the resulting 5+ ion, the remaining water and hydroxo ligands are highly acidic and the ionization and condensation processes can continue at still higher pHs. The formation of the oxo-dimer is a process called "oxolation," although sometimes olation and oxolation are not distinguished: Ultimately one observes the formation of the metal oxide:
