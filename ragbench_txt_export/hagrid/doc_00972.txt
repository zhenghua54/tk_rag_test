When "Simcoe District" was formed in 1843 by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, it contained 19 original townships. Simcoe District was restructured in 1845, changing its composition to 24 townships including the Township of Mono. Effective January 1, 1850, "An Act for abolishing the Territorial Divisions of Upper Canada into Districts" abolished Simcoe "District" in favour of the Simcoe "County", still composed of the Townships noted in the Act of 1845.
