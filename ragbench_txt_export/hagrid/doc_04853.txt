Ammonia solution, also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide, ammoniacal liquor, ammonia liquor, aqua ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or (inaccurately) ammonia, is a solution of ammonia in water. It can be denoted by the symbols NH(aq). Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition [NH][OH], it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NHOH. The ions NH and OH do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.
