Erin Hunter is a collective pseudonym used by the authors Victoria Holmes, Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Gillian Philip, Inbali Iserles, Tui T. Sutherland, and Rosie Best, in the writing of several juvenile fantasy novel series, which focus on animals and their adventures. Notable works include the "Warriors", "Seekers", "Survivors", and "Bravelands" book series. Each of the authors play a different role: while Holmes creates the storyline of each book, Cary, Baldry, and Sutherland take turns writing the books. In addition, another person who is not an Erin Hunter writes the manga: Dan Jolley.
