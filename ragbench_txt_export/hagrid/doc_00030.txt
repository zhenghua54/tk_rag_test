Christianity has been around in Pristina since its time under the Roman Empire. Before the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Roman and Byzantine Empires Christianized the whole of the Balkan region. After this during 1389 until 1912 the growth of the population of Muslims got higher due to the fact that Pristina was governed by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Therefore, Islamisation occurred. After World War II, Pristina was ruled by secular socialist authorities in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). In todayâ€™s time, most of the population of Pristina follows Islam. They have Muslim backgrounds and ancestry. but also including Slavic speakers (who mostly identify themselves as Gorani or Bosniaks) and Turks.
