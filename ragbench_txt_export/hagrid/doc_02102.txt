While the normal menstrual cycle in the human typically lasts 4 weeks (28 days, range 24–35 days) and consists of a follicular phase, ovulation, and a luteal phase, followed by either menstruation or pregnancy, the anovulatory cycle has cycle
lengths of varying degrees. In many circumstances, menstrual intervals are prolonged exceeding 35 days leading to oligomenorrhea (cycle >35 – 180 days interval), or even longer, amenorrhea. In other cases, menstruation may be fairly regular (eumenorrhea), or more frequent (intervals < 21 days), or there may be a loss of menstrual pattern (menorrhagia, dysfunctional uterine bleeding).
