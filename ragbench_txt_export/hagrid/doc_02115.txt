"Stigmata" received mixed reviews by critics, who compared it with the previous Arch Enemy album, "Black Earth". Jason Anderson of Allmusic noted that "as often happens with highly anticipated follow-ups, "Stigmata" disappointed some fans with what some called a more restrained sound and lesser material" and criticized the singer Johan Liiva and the addition of the session drummer Peter Wildoer. Nevertheless, Anderson praised Michael Amott stating that "these problems are really minor when balanced against Amott's massive playing and songwriting, so while "Stigmata" is a fraction off from the band's debut form, Arch Enemy still delivers some nice melodic death metal on the sophomore effort." Paul Schwarz of "Chronicles of Chaos" first noted that "Arch Enemy have made an interesting, and slightly unexpected, progression from their "Black Earth" debut of two years ago". He commented that the band "have not drawn their 'melody' from pop or even folk" and what characterises the difference between both albums "can be summed up in three words: classic heavy metal." Schwarz finished with a good review writing that "overall "Stigmata" is a great album and one of the best directions Arch Enemy could have chosen to follow after their critical success with "Black Earth"."
