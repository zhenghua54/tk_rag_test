Tag and Bink are two soldiers aboard the Rebellion flagship "Tantive IV" when the Star Destroyer "Devastator" captures it. After almost being captured, they dress up as stormtroopers and are transported to the Death Star. They try to leave by stealing TIE fighters... twice. Darth Vader realizes his need for two TIE pilots as wingmen for his fight against the Rebel starfighters attacking the space station. As the comic illustrates, it is not the "Millennium Falcon"s fault that Vader is almost killed in the trenches of the Death Star, but due to Tag and Bink's lousy piloting.
