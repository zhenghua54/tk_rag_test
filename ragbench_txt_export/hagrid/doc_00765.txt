The common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth, , is generally known as oxygen, but may be called "dioxygen", "diatomic oxygen", "molecular oxygen", or "oxygen gas" to distinguish it from the element itself and from the triatomic allotrope "ozone," . As a major component (about 21% by volume) of Earth's atmosphere, elemental oxygen is most commonly encountered in the diatomic form. Aerobic organisms utilize atmospheric dioxygen as the terminal oxidant in cellular respiration. The ground state of dioxygen is known as triplet oxygen, O, because it has two unpaired electrons. The first excited state, singlet oxygen, ""O has no unpaired electrons and is metastable.
