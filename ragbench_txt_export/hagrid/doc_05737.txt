The Freiburg Faculty of Theology is one of the constituent faculties of the University of Freiburg located in Freiburg, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Germany. It was one of the four founding faculties of the university in 1457. A Roman-Catholic faculty, approximately 700 students are enrolled as candidates for priesthood, as graduate theologists for service in the church, or in order to achieve graduate teaching qualifications. The Faculty of Theology has been home to influential theologians such as Thomas Murner, Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg, the critic of Protestant Reformation Johann Eck. The most famous personality of the faculty is undoubtedly Desiderius Erasmus, who was a member of the faculty from 1529 on, although he did not engage in teaching.
