Fluoroantimonic acid is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written , 2HF·SbF, or simply HF-SbF). It is an extremely strong acid, easily qualifying as a superacid. The Hammett acidity function, "H", has been measured for different ratios of HF:SbF. While the "H" of pure HF is −15, addition of just 1 mol % of SbF lowers it to around −20. However, further addition of SbF results in rapidly diminishing returns, with the "H" reaching −21 at 10 mol %. The use of an extremely weak base as indicator shows that the lowest attainable "H", even with > 50 mol % SbF, is somewhere between −21 and −23.
