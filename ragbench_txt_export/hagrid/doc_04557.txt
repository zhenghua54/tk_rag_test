Various Sentai series were broadcast in Malaysia starting with "Hikari Sentai Maskman" during the 1990s, dubbed in English and later in Malay. Almost all Super Sentai shows were broadcast in Thailand since the 1980s, a year following their Japanese debut. They were exclusively broadcast on Channel 9 from the late 1980s to early 1990s until "Power Rangers" replaced "Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger" in the mid-1990s. Since then, the series have appeared on various channels.
