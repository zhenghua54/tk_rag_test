Prior to creating "Nausicaä", Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, "Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro" (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of Richard Corben's "Rowlf" for TMS and the publishing firm Tokuma Shoten, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine "Animage", initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. "Nausicaä" was influenced by the Japanese folk tale "The Princess who Loved Insects", a similarly-named character from Homer's "Odyssey", the Minamata Bay mercury pollution, and various works of science fiction and fantasy by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in "Animage" from 1982 to 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven "tankōbon" volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.
