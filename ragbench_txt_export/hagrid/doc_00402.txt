The Scottish Parliament, which is a unicameral legislature comprising 129 members, was established in 1999 and has authority over many areas of domestic policy that have been devolved by the United Kingdom Parliament. The head of the Scottish Government, the executive of the devolved administration, is the First Minister of Scotland. Scotland is represented in the UK House of Commons by 59 MPs and in the European Parliament by 6 MEPs. Scotland is also a member of the British–Irish Council, and sends five members of the Scottish Parliament to the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly. Scotland is divided into 32 subdivisions, known as local authorities, or councils. Glasgow City is the largest subdivision in Scotland in terms of population, with Highland being the largest in terms of area. "Scotland" comes from "Scotti", the Latin name for the Gaels; "Scotia" initially referred to Ireland. From the ninth century, the meaning of "Scotia" shifted to designate Gaelic Scotland and by the eleventh century the name was being used to refer to the core territory of the Kingdom of Alba in what is now east-central Scotland. The use of the words "Scots" and "Scotland" to encompass most of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages, as the Kingdom of Alba expanded and came to encompass various peoples of diverse origins.
