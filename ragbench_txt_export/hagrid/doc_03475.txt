When NASCAR was founded in 1948, its sole tire supplier at the time was the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. In 1954, Goodyear entered the sport and engaged in a tire war with Firestone for the next two decades. In response to the deaths of Jimmy Pardue and Billy Wade, both Goodyear and Firestone started manufacturing the "Inner Liner Safety Spare" - also known in NASCAR as "Lifeguard", which was a second envelope inside the tire that prevented instantaneous deflating and allowed drivers to return to pit road after experiencing tire failure. Controversy erupted at Talladega Superspeedway's debut race in 1969, when drivers experienced tire failures during practice, resulting in Firestone withdrawing from the race and Richard Petty leading a driver walkout over safety concerns. Both tire manufacturers claimed race victories and speed records until Firestone withdrew from NASCAR in 1974.
