The Saints beat Geelong narrowly in their first final in 2010, and then comfortably won a Preliminary Final against the Western Bulldogs for the second year in a row. Lyon became the only man apart from Allan Jeans to coach St Kilda to multiple Grand Final appearances. The 2010 AFL Grand Final against Collingwood ended in a draw, with St Kilda coming from 24 points down at half-time to square the result at the final siren. The replay the following week saw the Saints beaten comfortably, and the club finished runner-up for the second year in a row.
