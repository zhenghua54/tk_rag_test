After 1840, emigration from Ireland became a massive, relentless, and efficiently managed national enterprise. In 1890 40% of Irish-born people were living abroad. By the 21st century, an estimated 80 million people worldwide claimed some Irish descent, which includes more than 36 million Americans who claim Irish as their primary ethnicity.

The language continues to be cultivated abroad by a small minority as a literary and social medium.  The Irish People are largely assimilated in most countries outside Ireland
