During the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar & Jahangir, Bohra community witnessed 2 major splits in Ahmedabad. The Bohras got divided into three major groups viz. Alavis, Dawoodis and Sulaimanis in the span of nearly 40 years- 997-1030 AH/1589-1621 AD. This way Ahmedabad today enjoys the only converging place of all the three Bohra groups after the splits as their "du’aat"-missionaries are buried in the same graveyard located at Saraspur (Bibipur). Due to the constant persecution by the Muslim rulers, Bohras left Ahmedabad permanently and shifted their seat of Da’wat. Alavi Bohras migrated to Vadodara in 1110 AH/1699 AD during the "da'iship" of 32nd "da'i" acting on the will of his predecessor and they were the last among Bohras to leave Ahmedabad. Dawoodi Bohras migrated to Jamnagar in 1065 AH/1657 AD and Sulaimani Bohras had their centre in Yemen after the split. Among Bohras in Ahmedabad, today Alavi Bohras remain as a minority with small number of families stay there.
The city of Vadodara deserves a special attention along with the Taiyebi missionary activities in Ahmedabad as many devoted personalities worked hard to retain the community faith when the turmoil of dissidents created by Ja’far Naherwali was at its peak. During the time of 21st Da’i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna saheb (tus) Hasan Badruddin bin Idrees (d. 933 AH/1537 AD) when Mahmood Shah II was the sultan of Gujarat, Mulla Isma’il of Vadodara migrated to Ahmedabad and he was martyred along with his accomplices on the banks of Sabarmati river.
