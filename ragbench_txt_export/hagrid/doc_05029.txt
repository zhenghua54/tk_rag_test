Trinidad and Tobago entered a currency union with other Caribbean nations after World War II. The currency of the union (see next paragraph) was replaced by the modern Trinidad and Tobago dollar in 1964, two years after the nation's independence in 1962. The Trinidad and Tobago dollar was launched, and had become the sole currency by 1967.
