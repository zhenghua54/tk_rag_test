Organophosphates (also known as phosphate esters) are a class of organophosphorus compounds with the general structure O=P(OR). They can be considered as esters of phosphoric acid. Like most functional groups organophosphates occur in a diverse range of forms, with important examples including key biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and ATP, as well as many insecticides, herbicides, and nerve agents.
