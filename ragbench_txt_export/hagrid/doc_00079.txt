While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of "Canada", the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word "kanata", meaning "village" or "settlement". In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word "Canada" to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as "Canada".
