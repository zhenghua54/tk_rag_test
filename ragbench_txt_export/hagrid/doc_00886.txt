Rajamouli started directing Telugu soap operas on Eenadu Television, under the guidance of K. Raghavendra Rao. Later on, he directed Santhi Nivasam TV Serial which was produced by K. Raghavendra Rao. His first shot at Telugu films was "Student No.1", with "Jr. NTR" in 2001. It took two years for Rajamouli to come up with his second movie "Simhadri". In the two-year gap between "Student No.1" and "Simhadri", Rajamouli planned his first mythological film with Malayalam actor Mohanlal, but the film eventually got shelved. In 2015, Assistant art director Manu Jagath, who later worked as the art director for Baahubali, released several sketches he had drawn for the shelved Mohanlal project. Rajamouli's third movie was "Sye", with actors Nithin and Genelia D'Souza. It was a first-of-its-kind movie in Tollywood, in that it was based on a rugby game. This movie was also the first instance where Rajamouli collaborated with K. K. Senthil Kumar. His next was "Chatrapathi", with the music of M. M. Keeravani and cinematography by Senthil Kumar.
