Iron(II) hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula Fe(OH). It is produced when iron(II) salts, from a compound such as iron(II) sulfate, are treated with hydroxide ions. Iron(II) hydroxide is a white solid, but even traces of oxygen impart a greenish tinge. The air-oxidized solid is sometimes known as "green rust".
