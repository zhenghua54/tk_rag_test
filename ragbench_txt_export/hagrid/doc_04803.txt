Davis was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Doris (Meyer) Morell and Joseph G. Davis. Davis moved to California with his family as a child in 1954. He was the first of the family's five children: three boys and two girls. He was raised a Roman Catholic. Davis and his family were one of the millions of Americans to migrate to the southwest and California as part of the post-World War II sun belt migration.
