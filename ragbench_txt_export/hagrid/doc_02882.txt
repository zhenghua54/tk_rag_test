Inherited, or congenital Long QT syndrome, is caused by genetic abnormalities. LQTS can arise from mutations in several genes, leading in some cases to quite different features. The condition is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, or rarely in an autosomal recessive fashion. The autosomal recessive forms of LQTS tend to have a more severe phenotype. Genetic testing for LQTS is clinically available and may help to direct appropriate therapies.
