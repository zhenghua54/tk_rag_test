A 2014 Gallup poll found that a plurality of Americans believe the media is biased to favor liberal politics. According to the poll, 44% of Americans feel that news media are "too liberal" (70% of self-identified conservatives, 35% of self-identified moderates, and 15% of self-identified liberals), while 19% believe them to be "too conservative" (12% of self-identified conservatives, 18% of self-identified moderates, and 33% of self-identified liberals), and 34% "just about right" (49% of self-identified liberals, 44% of self-identified moderates, and 16% of self-identified conservatives). In 2017, Gallup released the results of a poll with a similar question, with it finding that the majority of Americans view the news media favoring a particular political party, with 64% believing it favored the Democratic Party, compared to 22% who believed it favored the Republican Party.
