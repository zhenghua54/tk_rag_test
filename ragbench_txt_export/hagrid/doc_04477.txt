The 1941â€“42 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1941-42 NCAA Division I college basketball season. Elmer Ripley coached it in his sixth of ten seasons as head coach; it was also the fourth season of his second of three stints at the helm. For the second straight year, the team played its home games at Riverside Stadium in Washington, D.C., the last season in which Georgetown played home games there. It played an upgraded national schedule this season and struggled, finishing with a record of 9-11, and had no postseason play.
