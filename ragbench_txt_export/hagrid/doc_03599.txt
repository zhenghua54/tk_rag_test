Most households in India are cooled by fans, and less than 10% of households have air conditioning. The average rating of the fans installed and sold in the market is between 75-80W, whereas energy efficient fans provide the same level of comfort at about 45-50W. Considering that almost 30 million fans are sold every year, the potential to reduce demand is significant. Replacing the country's 35 crore inefficient ceiling fans in with BEE 5-Star-rated ceiling fans could save 47 billion KWh and reduce load by over 12,250 MW.
