Thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland, namely triiodothyronine (T) and thyroxine (T). They are tyrosine-based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. T and T are partially composed of iodine. A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T), which has a longer half-life than T. In humans, the ratio of T to T released into the blood is approximately 14:1. T is converted to the active T (three to four times more potent than T) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (Ta) and thyronamine (Ta). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for T production. Edward Calvin Kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915.
