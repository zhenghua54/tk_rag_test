By now, Carthage had recalled the general Hamilcar and his 5,000 Infantry and 500 cavalry from Sicily to join with generals Bostar and Hasdrubal in Africa. The army consisted of mercenaries, African light infantry, militia, cavalry, and elephants. The combined Carthaginian force set about organizing the defences of Adis, a city 40 miles southeast of Carthage, that was now under threat of a Roman siege. Despite possessing superior cavalry and elephants, the Carthaginians took up position on a hill overlooking the plain of Adis. The lack of training and decentralized command structure reflected poorly for the effectiveness of the army. The Carthaginians determined to resist and not allow further destruction by the Romans.
