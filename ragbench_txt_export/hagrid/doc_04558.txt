TV Asahi producer Chihiro Inoue brought up three ideas at the show's premiere conference. First was that they will continue to make Super Sentai fun and entertaining for children by keeping the same colorful action scenes, but they will use traditional Japanese musical themes such as those found in festival music. The second point was a desire to raise the agelessness of the series by including Toshihiro Yashiba and Takashi Sasano in the cast so adults and grandparents can enjoy the show with their children and grandchildren. The third point is that the supporting staff are all enthusiastic about the series. Inoue also wanted fans new and old to watch for the April 5, 2015 broadcast of the show (which has since been pushed back to April 12 due to "Ninninger"'s premiere being pushed back a week) as he planned a special homage to "Himitsu Sentai Gorenger", which premiered on April 5, 1975. The My Navi News reporter noted similarities between "Gorenger" and "Ninninger", particularly how the Ninninger team members are named with Japanese color names rather than English. He also noted the prior ninja-themed Super Sentai "Ninja Sentai Kakuranger" and "Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger", but felt that the story of "Ninninger" would be different.
