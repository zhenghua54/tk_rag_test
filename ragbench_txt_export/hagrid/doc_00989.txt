In addition to the standard TIE/ln fighter (also available as the TIE Light Duty training craft, as seen in the "Jump to Lightspeed" expansion pack to "Star Wars Galaxies"), a variety of other TIE craft appear throughout the films. Darth Vader flies a TIE Advanced x1; its prototype precursor, the TIE Advanced v1, was retroactively featured in "Star Wars Rebels" (the v1's variable-geometry wings, like Darth Maul's shuttle "Scimitar"'s, were inspired by Ralph McQuarrie's original sketches for the x1). "The Empire Strikes Back" introduces a TIE shuttle and TIE/sa bombers, which ferry Captain Needa (Michael Culver) to Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer and bomb asteroids in the hunt for the "Millennium Falcon", respectively. Both TIE craft have a design that stems from an unused "TIE boarding craft" concept developed for "A New Hope". The TIE bomber's double-hull design led ILM's modelmakers to dub the ship a "double chili dog" fighter. The TIE/sa was also the inspiration for the triple-hulled TIE lander, featured in "Star Wars" #60 and in "Star Wars: Complete Locations". TIE/IN interceptors — faster TIE fighters with dagger-shaped wings and four laser cannons — appear at various points in "Return of the Jedi". Two scales of TIE interceptor models were used during filming. In the "Legends" continuity, red modified TIE interceptors are also used by the Emperor's Royal Guards, as featured in "Rage of the Wookiees", another expansion of "Star Wars Galaxies". "The Force Awakens" features First Order TIE/fo "space superiority fighters" (this definition was later adapted to the TIE/sf and TIE/ln, too) that have deflector shields and Special Forces TIE/sf fighters with heavier weapons, a hyperdrive, and shields. "Flatter, fang-like" TIE striker atmospheric fighters appear in "Rogue One" (2016). "" also features the TIE silencer, the Advanced-like personal starfighter of Kylo Ren.
