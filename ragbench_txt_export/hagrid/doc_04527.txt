Not much published research exists which compares the efficacy and safety of the various antihistamines available. The research which does exist are mostly short term studies or studies which look at too few people to make general assumptions. Another gap in the research is in information reporting the health effects for individuals with long term allergies to take antihistamines for a long period of time. Newer antihistamines have been demonstrated to be effective in treating hives. However, there is not research comparing the relative efficacy of these drugs.
