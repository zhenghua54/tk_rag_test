Under Luke Howard's first systematized study of clouds, carried out in France in 1802, three general cloud "forms" were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation: "cirriform," "cumiliform" and "stratiform." These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude. In addition to these three main types, Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together: "cumulostratus," a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers, and "nimbus," a complex blending of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation.
