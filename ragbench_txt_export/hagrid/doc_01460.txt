American bison has been bred with the domestic Tibetan yak to create the yakalo.
Domestic yak bulls mated with bison cows produced fully fecund progeny, both sexes. Male yak bred to beefalo produced fertile females and sterile males. The appearance of the yak X bison hybrid is strongly reminiscent morphologically to Bison latifrons.
