The team name is derived from the mixed Greek and Latin chant "Hoya Saxa" (meaning "What Rocks"), which gained popularity at the school in the late nineteenth century. The name "Hoyas" came into use in the 1920s. Most teams have their athletic facilities on the main campus of Georgetown University. The men's basketball team plays most of their home games at the Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, D.C. and the baseball team plays at Shirley Povich Field in Cabin John, Maryland. Lee Reed took over as the school's athletic director in April 2010.
