Albert George Haynesworth III (born June 17, 1981) is a former American football defensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons. He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the first round (15th overall) of the 2002 NFL Draft, he spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Titans. An All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008, and considered "the most dominant defensive tackle in the league" at that time, Haynesworth was a highly coveted free agent following the 2008 season. He signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with the Washington Redskins in February 2009, but played less than two full seasons with Washington. The Redskins' acquisition of Haynesworth has since been widely derided as the worst free agent signing in NFL history.
