The storyline in which Peter Porte joined the show as Paul's psychotic son Ricky was praised. Adam Hughes of Yahoo! described the possibilities stemming from his return: "Ricky will undoubtedly open up many old wounds and many new story line possibilities. Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?" After Paul was forced to shoot (and kill) Ricky, Michael Logan of "TV Guide" wrote that "the actor tackled his toughest story yet when his character unintentionally killed his own son and nearly went to the slammer. Davidson's performance was so beautiful and poignant it made our souls ache". Zap2it placed Davidson on a list of "Top 10 Male Entertainers" by the end of 2012: "For the better part of a decade, daytime's best male crier, Doug Davidson rode the bench on "The Young and the Restless". This was strange, since his popular, P.I. character Paul Williams had previously and consistently driven story on the soap throughout the late 70s, 80s, 90s and early 00s". The website was pleased with Paul's new storylines, saying that the "harrowing image" before Paul shot and killed his son "will stay with us for a while". Dave Masko of the website Huliq called "turning the character of Paul from a mainstay on the series for 30 years, into someone who murders his own son" one of the stops pulled out by "The Young and the Restless" to boost "slipping" ratings.
