The first modern cruise, which defined the journey not just as transport but as the actual reward, commenced on 22 January 1891, when the SS "Auguste Victoria" (named after the German empress) set sail to cruise the Mediterranean for six weeks. The competitors initially sniggered at Ballin, who organized and supervised the voyage personally, but the project was a huge success. In order to accommodate the growing demand, another three of the SS "Auguste Victoria"'s sister ships operated as cruise liners, and in 1899, the Hamburg-America Line commissioned Blohm & Voss to construct the first purpose-built cruise ship, the "Prinzessin Victoria Luise". It was the very first cruise ship, one exclusively tailored for the needs of well-to-do passengers.
