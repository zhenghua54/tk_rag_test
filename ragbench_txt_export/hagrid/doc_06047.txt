Rachel ( "Rāḥêl", meaning ewe) was a Biblical figure best known for her infertility. The site revered as her burial place (Rachel's Tomb) is one of the holiest sites in Judaism. Rachel was the favorite of Jacob's two wives, and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, two of the twelve progenitors of the tribes of Israel. Rachel's father was Laban. Her older sister was Leah, Jacob's first wife. Her aunt Rebekah was Jacob's mother.
