The jukebox industry continued to grow through the Great Depression, and was advertised heavily in "Billboard", which led to even more editorial focus on music. The proliferation of the phonograph and radio also contributed to its growing music emphasis. "Billboard" published the first music hit parade on January 4, 1936, and introduced a "Record Buying Guide" in January 1939. In 1940, it introduced "Chart Line", which tracked the best-selling records, and was followed by a chart for jukebox records in 1944 called Music Box Machine charts. By the 1940s, "Billboard" was more of a music industry specialist publication. The number of charts it published grew after World War II, due to a growing variety of music interests and genres. It had eight charts by 1987, covering different genres and formats, and 28 charts by 1994.
