"Usuba bōchō" are vegetable knives used by professionals. They differ from the "Nakiri bōchō" in the shape of the cutting edge. While the "nakiri bōchō" is sharpened from both sides, the "usuba bōchō" is sharpened only from one side, a style known as "kataba" in Japanese. The highest quality "kataba" blades have a slight depression on the flat side. This "kataba" style edge gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the "ryōba" used for "nakiri bōchō", but requires more skill to use. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right hand use of the knife, but knives sharpened on the left side are available for left hand use. The "usuba bōchō" is heavier than a "nakiri bōchō", although still much lighter than a "deba bōchō".
