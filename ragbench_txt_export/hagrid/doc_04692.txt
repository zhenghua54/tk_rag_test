The U.S. version was shown at the 1988 Summer Consumer Electronic Show under the title "Ken the Great Bear Fist", which is the localized title used by Toei's international sales department. The title was changed to "Fist of the North Star" for its release in order to tie in with Viz's English adaptation of the manga. The cover artwork for the U.S. version depicts Kenshiro sparring with Toki, who doesn't appear in the game and never actually appeared in the "Hokuto no Ken 2" anime series outside flashbacks (as the character was already deceased by that point of the storyline). The NES version has some slight differences from its Famicom counterpart, which cuts the appearances of side characters at the end of certain stages (such as Bat and Rin at the end of the first stage), as well as the kanji that appear at the top of the screen when Kenshiro defeats a boss after striking its weak point at the start of the battle.
