Charles I of Spain's court was set in Toledo, serving as the imperial capital. In 1560, Toledo reached a population of 60,000, being the 3rd city of the Crown of Castile. However, in 1561, in the first years of his son Philip II of Spain's reign, the Spanish court was moved to Madrid, thus letting the city's importance dwindle until the late 20th century, when it became the capital of the autonomous community of Castileâ€“La Mancha. Nevertheless, the economic decline of the city helped to preserve its cultural and architectural heritage. Today, because of this rich heritage, Toledo is one of Spain's foremost cities, receiving thousands of visitors yearly.
