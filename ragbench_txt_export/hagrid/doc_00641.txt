The United States developed the first aircraft carrier, the USS "Remembrance". This ship first sailed in 1920 and assisted the Irish government in suppressing a pro-British rebellion in Ulster. The "Remembrance", for many years, was the only U.S. aircraft carrier. The Pacific War saw the first naval battles where the combatants engaged one another with planes instead of ships. During the Second Great War, several escort carriers were built from converted merchant ship hulls.
