In Canada, the Global Television Network airs new episodes a day ahead of the US broadcast. Most Global stations use "The Young and the Restless" as a late-afternoon lead-in for their local newscasts, but times vary by market. It also airs on NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador which airs the program on a same-day-as-CBS basis.
