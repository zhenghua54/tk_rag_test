In the same year, construction begins on the Suncorp Stadium redevelopment in Brisbane. The redevelopment of Suncorp Stadium was the biggest and most ambitious project of its kind ever undertaken by the Department of Public Works. It involved a significant expansion of the stadium and the implementation of extensive built infrastructure and technologically advanced building systems.
The 52,500-seat world-class venue opened in June 2003 – on budget and on time – and became home to the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team. Today, it also hosts national and international rugby union and soccer games along with State of Origin matches and music concerts.
