Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats. It is one of several transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which also includes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease"), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and chronic wasting disease in deer. Like other spongiform encephalopathies, the cause of scrapie is unknown, but is thought to be caused by an infectious misfolded protein called a prion. Scrapie has been known since 1732, and does not appear to be transmissible to humans.
