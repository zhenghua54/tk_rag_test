After seven years on the air, the soap opera started slowly to lose viewers. Still a ratings success several cast changes seemed to hurt the show in the process. When Das Erste decided to change the airtime of both soaps, "Verbotene Liebe" (5:50 pm) and "Marienhof" (6:20 pm), particularly "VL" had now to challenge RTL's soap opera "Unter uns", which ended at 6:00 pm. After two years, Das Erste changed the airtime again. "Verbotene Liebe" started around 6:00 pm and still provided the lead-in for "Marienhof", which started around 6:25 pm again. In the meanwhile, the Pay-TV channel Passion started airing repeats in late 2006. However, the original airings of "Verbotene Liebe" and "Marienhof" continued to lose viewers and in late 2010 cancellation rumors started to surround fan bases. Das Erste eventually canceled "Marienhof" after over 18 years on the air and continued "Verbotene Liebe", extending their episodes to 50 minutes with commercial breaks. The glamor soap served as the lead-in for various new crime dramedy series'. With the extension, "VL" now aired repeats on several ARD stations.
