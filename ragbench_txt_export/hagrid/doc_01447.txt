"Oshin", a serialised morning TV drama or asadora, was the first asadora to be both produced and written by women in Japan. Hashida is known particularly for writing "Oshin", but she can be considered Japan's most successful TV drama script writer. "Oshin" was broadcast throughout Asia and became one of Japan's most famous television dramas. The series was developed from Hashida's original script.
