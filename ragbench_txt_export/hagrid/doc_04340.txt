'QUBIT' is the annual technical fest of the Department of Computer Science. It is a prestigious technological event in the state with papers presented from all over the country. It has risen beyond its technical reach and incorporated cultural aspects with the introduction of Lan-Gaming, Treasure Hunts, Fun Stalls etc. giving it an all round reach. It is organised during the month of March right from the year of its inception without fail. It is a technical symposium for young minds and meeting ground for tech-enthusiasts from around the country.
