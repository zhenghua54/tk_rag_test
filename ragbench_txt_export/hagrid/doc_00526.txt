Scott William Pilgrim is the 23-year-old (22 in film and 24 in volumes 5-6) protagonist. He is the bass player for the band Sex Bob-Omb with his friends Stephen Stills and Kim Pine; he plays a Rickenbacker 4001c64, 4003 in the film. Though initially unemployed, he later gets a job as a dish washer and food prep trainee at The Happy Avocado vegetarian restaurant. The character's name was inspired by the song "Scott Pilgrim" from Plumtree's 1998 album "Predicts the Future". He believes that smoking is evil, drinks "only on occasions", and doesn't hit girls. Scott seems to suffer from memory problems, which his friends chalk up to his stupidity, though the memory problems began after his break-up with Envy Adams whom he dated through college. The series also references a "dark side" of Scott's personality which he avoids as much as possible. He is initially devastated by his break-up with Envy Adams and begins dating Knives Chau, before meeting Ramona. Ramona and Scott begin dating, but Scott is plagued by Ramona's elusive past and her "7 evil exes" led by the mysterious "Gideon", all of whom challenge him in succession for the right to date her. Despite his limited intelligence and poor memory capacity, Scott is often able to defeat his opponents through cunning rather than brute strength: in volume 2, he manages to goad Lucas Lee into performing a dangerous skateboarding trick and in the film adaptation, he successfully tricks Todd Ingram into consuming dairy products despite Todd's psychic powers. Scott is a surprisingly skilled fighter in unarmed combat and sword fighting. His hair is usually "messed up" after Ramona laughed at Scott when he had straight hair. He often dreams of stupid games until Ramona tells him to get a job.
