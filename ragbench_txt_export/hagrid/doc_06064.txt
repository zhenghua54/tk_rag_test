BFC Germania 1888 was founded by 17-year-old Paul Jestram, his three brothers, and a number of their schoolmates from Askanischen Gymnasium at a time when football was not yet common in Germany, the first football games having been played in Berlin and Hamburg in the winter of 1881â€“82 by expatriate Englishmen. No football pitches had yet been built so "BFC" played on the Tempelhofer field where an airport would later be constructed.
