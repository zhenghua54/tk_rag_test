In the meantime, Nomura was also responsible for the main character designs and orchestration of "The World Ends with You" for the Nintendo DS. In 2009, he was also the main character designer of "Final Fantasy XIII". The graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the non-playable characters. In 2008, he was the character designer of "Dissidia Final Fantasy". The game was originally envisioned by Nomura as a "Kingdom Hearts" spin-off featuring a cast of Disney characters. He later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use "Final Fantasy" characters. Nomura was responsible for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Amano's illustrations.
