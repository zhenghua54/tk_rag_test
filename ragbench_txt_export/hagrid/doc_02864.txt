Ledyard holds that the Koreans adopted five core consonant letters from ’Phags-pa, namely ㄱ "g" , ㄷ "d" , ㅂ "b" , ㅈ "j" , and ㄹ "l" . These were the consonants basic to Chinese phonology, rather than the graphically simplest letters (ㄱ "g" , ㄴ "n" , ㅁ "m" , and ㅅ "s" ) taken as the starting point by the "Haerye." A sixth letter, the null initial ㅇ, was invented by Sejong. The rest of the consonants were developed through featural derivation from these six, essentially as described in the "Haerye"; a resemblance to speech organs was an additional motivating factor in selecting the shapes of both the basic letters and their derivatives.
