In 1987, The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication, through its animation production unit Walt Disney Television Animation; "DuckTales" debuted that September, experiencing major success and eventually lasting for 100 episodes. The success of "DuckTales" paved the way for a second series two years later, "Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers". In 1989, the two shows aired together as part of a syndicated daily block called "The Disney Afternoon". In 1991, Disney added another hour to the block; "The Disney Afternoon" ran until August 29, 1997, when it was replaced by an unnamed block on September 1, 1997, until 1999, which was then replaced by "Disney's One Too" (a spinoff of ABC Saturday morning block "Disney's One Saturday Morning") - and "Disney's One Too" had only lasted for four years on UPN and syndication, until it had died in 2003. Since then, there are only a handful of local networks in the United States for ABC that broadcast children's programming. Otherwise, it has been replaced by reality shows, court shows, tabloid television, talk shows, and among other programming which are meant for adults.
