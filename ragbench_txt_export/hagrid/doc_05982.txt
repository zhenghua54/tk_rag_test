Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from "hydrargyrum", a Latinized form of the Greek word ὑδράργυρος ("hydrargyros"), which is a compound word meaning "water-silver" (from ὑδρ- "hydr-", the root of ὕδωρ, "water," and ἄργυρος "argyros" "silver") – since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for his speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is "Rasavātam" which means "the way of mercury". Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.
