After the Grail is found, the last battle of the Knights of the Round Table is fought. In this battle many knights die, and with them King Arthur, Sir Gawain, who is Arthur's nephew, and Mordred, the wicked son of King Arthur, and his half-sister Morgana le Fay. King Arthur is taken away to Avalon, a secret island after he is terribly wounded by Mordred while he was making the final stab with his sword to kill Mordred.
