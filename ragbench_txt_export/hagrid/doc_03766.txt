Wellington was conceived in 1979 by a group of entrepreneurs with the goal of creating the first coeducational, independent school in Columbus. These entrepreneurs were Ken Ackerman, Harry K. Gard, Bob Holland, Len Immke, George Minot, Dave Swaddling, Dave Thomas, Jack Ruscilli, and Jeff Wilkins.
They spent three years refining plans, raising money, finding a property, and recruiting teachers and students. In 1982, The Wellington School opened with 137 students and 19 employees as the first co-ed independent school in Columbus. The first graduating class was in 1989 with 32 students. In 2010, the new 76,000 square foot building opened. In 2012, the Little Jags preschool program for 3-year-olds began.
