Junta () during Spanish American independence was the type of government formed as a patriotic alternative to the Spanish colonial government during the first phase of Spanish American wars of independence (1808â€“1810). The formation of juntas was usually an urban movement. Most juntas were created out of the already-existing "ayuntamientos" (municipal councils) with the addition of other prominent members of society.
