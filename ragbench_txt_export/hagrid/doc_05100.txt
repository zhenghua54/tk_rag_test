The predecessors of the złoty were the Polish mark ("grzywna") and a "kopa". Grzywna was a currency that was equivalent to approximately 210 g of silver, in the 11th century. It was used until sometime in the 14th century, when it gave way to the Kraków grzywna (approximately 198 g of silver). At the same time, first as the complement to grzywna, and then as the main currency, came a grosz and a kopa. Poland made "grosz" as the imitation of the Prague groschen; the idea of "kopa" came from the Czechs as well. A grzywna was worth 48 groszy; a kopa cost 60 groszy.
