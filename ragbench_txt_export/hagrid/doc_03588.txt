The Early Cretaceous Epoch spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago. The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America). Many coastal shallows were created, and that caused ichthyosaurs to die out. Mosasaurs evolved to replace them as apex species of the seas. Some island-hopping dinosaurs, like "Eustreptospondylus", evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs, such as "Carcharodontosaurus" and "Spinosaurus", rose to fill the empty space that the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction had created. Of the most successful would be the "Iguanodon" which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles grew seasonally colder. Dinosaurs such as the "Leaellynasaura" inhabited the polar forests year-round, while many dinosaurs, such as the "Muttaburrasaurus", migrated there during summer . Since it was too cold for crocodiles, it was the last stronghold for large amphibians, such as the "Koolasuchus". In this epoch Pterosaurs reached their maximum diversity and grew larger, as species like "Tapejara" and "Ornithocheirus" took to the skies. The first true birds evolved, possibly sparking competition between them and the pterosaurs.
