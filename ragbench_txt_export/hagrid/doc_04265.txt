Upon confederation, the Federal government took control of Indian affairs in Canada under the Department of Indian Affairs. From 1867 until 1873, the Secretary of State for Canada was also named the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. In 1873, the role of Superintendent General of Indians Affairs was turned over to the Minister of the Interior. In 1880, a separate Department of Indian Affairs was created. The Minister of the Interior was the Minister of the Department of Indian Affairs until 1883, when the Privy Council assumed the role, and the Minister of the Interior was the Minister of the Department of Indian affairs from 1887 until 1930, when it was briefly turned over to the Minister of Immigration and Colonization, and then back to the Department of the Interior until 1935.
