and this has been interpreted to mean that the name of the country is simply "Canada". No constitutional statute amends this name, and the subsequent Canada Act 1982 does not use the term "dominion". However, the Canadian constitution includes the preceding BNA Acts, where the term is used; also, the Canada Act 1982 does not state that Canada is not a dominion. Official sources of the United Nations system, international organizations (such as the Organization of American States), the European Union, the United States, and other polities with which Canada has official relations as a state consistently use "Canada" as the only official name, state that Canada has no long-form name, or that the formal name is simply "Canada". While no legal document ever says that the name of the country is anything other than "Canada", "Dominion" and "Dominion of Canada" remain official titles of the country.
