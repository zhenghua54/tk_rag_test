NBC intended to make Chicago a major hub for its radio networks. In 1930, the network leased more than 66,000 square feet of space in the newly completed Merchandise Mart with plans to move 50 radio programs which were presently originating in New York to their new Chicago headquarters. In 1931, NBC was able to purchase Chicago radio station WENR from financially troubled Samuel Insull. Later in the year, it bought WMAQ from the "Daily News". With the purchase of WMAQ, the network now owned a radio station in Chicago for their Blue Network (WENR) and their Red Network (WMAQ). While WMAQ was moved to NBC's new Merchandise Mart base of operations a few months after it was purchased, WENR remained at Chicago's Civic Opera House, where it was based when owned by Insull.
