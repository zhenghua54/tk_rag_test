The ship was laid down as "Cabot" on 15 July 1941 by Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. In May 1942, , which had been built in the same shipyard two decades earlier, was sunk at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In June, workers at the shipyard submitted a request to Navy Secretary Frank Knox to change the name of a carrier currently under construction there to "Lexington". Knox agreed to the proposal and "Cabot" was renamed as the fifth USS "Lexington" on 16 June 1942. She was launched on 23 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Theodore Douglas Robinson. "Lexington" was commissioned on 17 February 1943, with Captain Felix Stump USN in command.
