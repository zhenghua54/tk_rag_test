A nerf is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change. The first established use of the term was in "Ultima Online", as a reference to the Nerf brand of toys whose bullets are soft and less likely to cause serious injury.
