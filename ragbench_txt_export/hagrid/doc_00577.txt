Some of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in Boolean algebra. This was created by George Boole in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include formula_17 (AND), formula_18 (OR), and formula_19 ("not"). With these symbols, and letters to represent different truth values, one can make logical statements such as formula_20, that is "("a" is true OR "a" is "not" true) is true", meaning it is true that "a" is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic. Predicate logic, originally called "predicate calculus", expands on propositional logic by the introduction of variables and by sentences containing variables, called predicates. In addition, predicate logic allows quantifiers. With these logic symbols and additional quantifiers from predicate logic, valid proofs can be made that are irrationally artificial, but syntactical.
