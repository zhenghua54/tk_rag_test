On July 19, 2007, Silicon Knights sued Epic Games due to "breach of contract", including "inadequacies" of Epic's support, service, and cooperation with Silicon Knights concerning Unreal Engine 3. Among claims, Silicon Knights accused Epic of missing the deadline to provide a fully functional version of their engine. In August 2007, Epic Games counter-sued Silicon Knights for copyright infringement, breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. On May 30, 2012, Epic Games prevailed in the lawsuit and won its counter-suit for $4.45 million. As a result, Silicon Knights was forced to recall and destroy all unsold copies of their Unreal Engine games.
