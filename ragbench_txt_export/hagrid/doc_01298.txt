Computers (namely, the "C" in "ABC Dictionary") were purposefully involved in almost every stage of dictionary compilation and publication in order to facilitate further advances in electronic lexicography and software development. In 1997, the Wenlin Institute published "Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese" with about 14,000 head entries (version 1.0) and entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Hawaii to utilize the "ABC Dictionary" database in Wenlin software. The first edition "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary" (1996) was incorporated into Wenlin 2.0 with over 74,000 entries (1998); the second "ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary" (2003) went into Wenlin 3.0 with over 196,000 entries (2002); and the third edition "ABC English-Chinese/Chinese–English Dictionary" (2010) was incorporated into Wenlin 4.0 (2011), which includes 300,000 Chinese–English entries, 73,000 Chinese character entries, and 62,000 English-Chinese entries.
