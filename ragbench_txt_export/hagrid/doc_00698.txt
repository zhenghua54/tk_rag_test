During the Silver Age, comic books frequently had several features, a form harkening back to the Golden Age when the first comics were anthologies. In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic. But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled. Marvel tried to create new double feature anthologies such as "Amazing Adventures" and "Astonishing Tales" which did not last as double feature comic books. A more enduring concept was that of the team-up book, either combining two characters, at least one of which was not popular enough to sustain its own title ("Green Lantern/Green Arrow", "Super-Villain Team-Up", "Power Man and Iron Fist", "Daredevil and the Black Widow", "Captain America and the Falcon") or a very popular character with a guest star of the month ("Marvel Team-Up" and "Marvel Two-in-One"). Even DC combined two features in "Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes" and had team-up books ("The Brave and the Bold", "DC Comics Presents" and "World's Finest Comics"). Virtually all such books disappeared by the end of the period.
