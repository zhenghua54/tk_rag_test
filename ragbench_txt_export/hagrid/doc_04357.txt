Aaron Greenspan created a web portal as a Harvard undergraduate called houseSYSTEM that launched in August 2003. In February 2004, when thefacebook.com launched, Greenspan recognized aspects of his own work in the site, and later came to believe that Zuckerberg was copying his work one feature at a timeâ€”a claim that Zuckerberg denied. Regarding Greenspan's allegations, Zuckerberg was described in "The New York Times" as "saying through a spokeswoman that he was not sure how to respond". Greenspan's company filed a Petition to Cancel the "Facebook" trademark, which included claims of prior use and fraud by Facebook, Inc. against the USPTO. Facebook, Inc. agreed to a formal settlement with Greenspan in late May 2009 and issued a press release, but the terms were not disclosed.
