The biblical word Shoah (שואה), also spelled Shoa and Sho'ah, meaning "calamity" in Hebrew (and also used to refer to "destruction" since the Middle Ages), became the standard Hebrew term for the 20th-century "Holocaust" as early as the early 1940s. In recent literature it is specifically prefixed with Ha ("The" in Hebrew) when referring to Nazi mass-murders, for the same reason that "holocaust" becomes ""The" Holocaust". It may be spelled "Ha-Shoah" or "HaShoah", as in Yom HaShoah, the annual Jewish "Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day".
