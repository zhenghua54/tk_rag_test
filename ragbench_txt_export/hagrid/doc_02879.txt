Inherited or sporadic KCNE gene mutations can cause Romano-Ward syndrome (heterozygotes) and Jervell Lange-Nielsens syndrome (homozygotes). Both these syndromes are characterized by Long QT syndrome, a delay in ventricular repolarization. In addition, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome also involves bilateral sensorineural deafness. Mutation D76N in the KCNE1 protein can lead to long QT syndrome due to structural changes in the KvLQT1/KCNE1 complex, and people with these mutations are advised to avoid triggers of cardiac arrhythmia and prolonged QT intervals, such as stress or strenuous exercise.
