Phoenix is a web development framework written in the functional programming language Elixir. Phoenix uses a server-side model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Based on the Plug library, and ultimately the Cowboy Erlang framework, it was developed to provide highly performant and scalable web applications. In addition to the request/response functionality provided by the underlying Cowboy server, Phoenix provides soft realtime communication to external clients through websockets or long polling using its language agnostic channels feature.
