Fibromyalgia was defined relatively recently. It continues to be a disputed diagnosis. Dr. Frederick Wolfe, lead author of the 1990 paper that first defined the diagnostic guidelines for fibromyalgia, stated in 2008 that he believed it "clearly" not to be a disease but instead a physical response to depression and stress. In 2013 Wolfe added that its causes "are controversial in a sense" and "there are many factors that produce these symptoms â€“ some are psychological and some are physical and it does exist on a continuum".
