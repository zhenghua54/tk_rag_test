On February 15, Gálvez dispatched the "San Antonio", captained by Juan Pérez, from Cabo San Lucas; Franciscan friars Juan Vizcaíno and Francisco Gómez served as chaplains. With sailors plus cooks, carpenters and blacksmiths, the "San Antonio" carried a total of around 30 men. These ships left ahead of the land groups. The "San Carlos" and "San Antonio" were followed by an additional supply ship, the "San José", which was named after the patron saint of the Portolá expedition, Saint Joseph. The "San José" never reached San Diego and was presumed lost at sea.
