Nickelodeon launched on April 1, 1979 (as the first ever all children's network) on Warner Cable franchises across the country. Nickelodeon's name was proposed by New York based creative director/designer Joseph Iozzi, who also created the channel's first logo and original advertising campaign. Iozzi saw the word "nickelodeon" as a natural fit for the proposed children's channel: "The Nickelodeon was a turn of the century device for dispensing entertainment. The sound of the word was nice and rolled off the tongue easily". Hauser ultimately selected Iozzi's proposal out of a list out of 150 names. The other proposed names for the channel included The Savoy Channel and The Rainbow Network.
