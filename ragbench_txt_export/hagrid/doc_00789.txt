Mongolia is divided into 21 Provinces (, often translated as aimags) and one provincial municipality. Each aimag is subdivided into several districts. The modern provinces have been established since 1921. The capital, Ulaanbaatar, is governed as an independent provincial municipality separate from TÃ¶v Province, inside which it is situated.
