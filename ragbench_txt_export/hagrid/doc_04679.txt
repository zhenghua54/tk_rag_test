Cybertron, as presented in the original "The Transformers" animated series, was considerably smaller than the planet Earth, though "how" much smaller it was presented as was inconsistent, as were many other things in the series. Entirely metallic on the surface, some of the lowest levels of Cybertron consist of rock and dirt, suggesting a natural beginning to the planet. Its gravity is light enough that humans are able to traverse the surface without any trouble, and it possesses a breathable atmosphere. Water is not uncommon on the planet – lake and rivers have been shown to exist, albeit sparingly. Cybertron is orbited by at least two unnamed moons, but its own place in the cosmos appears unfixed – in 1984, it was clearly shown to exist outside of the Milky Way galaxy; however, nine million years prior, Starscream and Skyfire had been able to fly from the planet to Earth under their own power, suggesting that it may drift freely through space, and had been passing through the Solar system at that point, going on to drift out of the galaxy over the ensuing millennia. Cybertron's moons did not appear until the animated feature "", and no explanation for their existence was given. The moons were also depicted as being mechanical in nature much like Cybertron with metallic surfaces. Unlike Cybertron however, the moons do not appear to have any detectable atmosphere, as Daniel Witwicky, a longtime ally of the Autobots, was required to wear a mechanical "exo suit" that presumably included its own air supply and means to keep organic life forms pressurized against the vacuum of space, something that is not required by humans on Cybetron.
