Fallon's first television role came in 2015 when she was cast as Bethany Platt, the daughter of Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), in the ITV soap opera "Coronation Street". A returning character, Bethany had been played by child actors Mia Cookson (2000) and twins Amy and Emily Walton (2000â€“2007), before Fallon took over. The actress was nineteen when she was cast to play the fourteen-year-old Bethany. She was offered the role after it emerged that the actress who was originally chosen for the part lied about her age.
