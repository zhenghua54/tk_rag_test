Somewhat less common are surface anchors, commonly made from surgical implant-grade titanium. A surface anchor has two parts: a base or foot which is inserted under the dermis during the piercing process and which incorporates a stem exposed to the surface, and a decorative disc or ball of jewelry which typically appears flush with the surface of the skin. Surface anchor nape piercings are most commonly found placed symmetrically on either side of the spine at the nape.
