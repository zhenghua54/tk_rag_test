Early Islamic philosophy began in the 2nd century AH of the Islamic calendar (early 9th century CE) and lasted until the 6th century AH (late 12th century CE). The period is known as the Golden Age of Islam, and the achievements of this period had a crucial influence on the development of modern philosophy and science in the Western world; for Renaissance Europe, the influence represented from the Islamic Golden Age was “one of the largest technology transfers in world history”. This period began with al-Kindi in the 9th century and ended with Averroes (Ibn Rushd) at the end of 12th century. The death of Averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Arabic School, and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries such as Islamic Iberia and North Africa.
