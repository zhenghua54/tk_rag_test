In 1928 Orwell went to Paris for 18 months. In March 1929 he was feeling unwell and spent two weeks in the HÃ´pital Cochin, rue Faubourg Saint-Jacques, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. Ill with the flu, he was treated at the hospital from 7 to 22 March 1929. While in the hospital he continued writing, as he gave it as an address to a publisher. Orwell was subject to bronchial conditions throughout his life, but it is not certain whether he was suffering from influenza or pneumonia. In Paris, he was checked for tuberculosis and found to be unaffected.
