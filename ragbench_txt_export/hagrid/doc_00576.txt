The syllogistic logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th century, when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called mathematical logic). In 1854, George Boole published "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities", introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as Boolean logic. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published "Begriffsschrift", which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation. From 1910 to 1913, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published "Principia Mathematica" on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. In 1931, Gödel raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.
