"Capitol" debuted on CBS in 1982 in 8th place in the ratings, roughly the same as "Search for Tomorrow" had done. "Capitol" remained in the middle of the ratings pack throughout its five-year run ranking between 7th and 9th, with its best ratings points of 6.4 achieved in the 1983-1984 television season, in which it ranked 8th. In 1985, ratings fell slightly from a 5.8 to a 5.1, prompting some CBS affiliates to drop the show. CBS subsequently canceled the show and replaced it with "The Bold and the Beautiful" on March 23, 1987. However, CBS put "The Bold and the Beautiful" in the 1:30/12:30 timeslot, bumping "As the World Turns" to 2/1. "The Bold and the Beautiful" became both CBS' and America's second-highest rated soap opera, but its ratings never surpassed "Capitol" ratings peak.
