In the early 1880s, when Chappelle was nominated to the Massachusetts General Court, he was opposed by other African-American candidates. An elected African-American secretary in his own party said that he had been elected by fraud. The charges against Chappelle were proven untrue with a recount of two times. The "New York Globe" wrote in its Boston politics section, "Chappelle will, in the opinion of many white and colored voters, be elected in spite of such mean tricks."
