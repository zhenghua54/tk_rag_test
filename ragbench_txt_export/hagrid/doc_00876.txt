As of January 2012, the state-certified engineer/engineering technologist was allocated to level 6 of the European Qualifications Framework, equivalent to undergraduate degrees (Bachelor's level). Furthermore, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principal permits entry into any undergraduate academic degree program. The engineering technologist/state-certified engineer should not be confused with academically qualified engineers, which previously graduated from Universities as Diplom-Ingenieur (Diploma in Engineering) and following the Bologna process with BEng + MEng degrees.
