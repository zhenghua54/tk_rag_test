Rose finally saw transmission on schedule on 26 March 2005 at 7Â pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of "Doctor Who" since Part Three of "Survival" on 6 December 1989. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced "Doctor Who Confidential", a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on BBC Three immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. Both the series and documentary aired for 13 consecutive weeks, with the finale episode, "The Parting of the Ways", airing on 18 June 2005 along with its documentary counterpart. Davies had requested that the two first episodes were broadcast back-to-back, but the request was given to the BBC just two weeks before transmission, at which point everything was already set. In some regions, the first few minutes of the original BBC broadcast of "Rose" on 26 March were marred by the accidental mixing of a few seconds of sound from Graham Norton hosting "Strictly Dance Fever".
