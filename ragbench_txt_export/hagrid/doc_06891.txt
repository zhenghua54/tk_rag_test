Algebra was also pioneered by Persian Scientist Muhammad ibn M큰s훮 al-Khw훮rizm카 during this time in his landmark text, Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala, from which the term algebra is derived. He is thus considered to be the father of algebra. The terms algorism and algorithm are also derived from the name of al-Khwarizmi, who was responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals and Hindu-Arabic numeral system beyond the Indian Subcontinent.
