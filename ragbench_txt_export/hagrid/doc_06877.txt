Residential Schools operated in Canada from the 1800s until 1996. These schools were said to be a primary weapon of the government and the missionaries in their attempt to systematically destroy Native culture. Generations of First Nations people were scarred from the effects of their policies.
When the video was made, there was very little discussion about the crucial subject of residential schools either in the education system, or in the mass media. This controversial subject did not seem to be part of the collective consciousness at that time. Hanah was quoted saying she had no awareness of any books or films on the subject when she made the documentary. Her intention was to further the subject into general awareness and in the public forum to begin further examination and exposure. Also in following the acts of Shirley Cheechooâ€™s play, Hanah hoped to reinforce the healing that comes from exposing these stories.
