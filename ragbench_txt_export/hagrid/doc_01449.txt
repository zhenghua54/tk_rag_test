The novel mentions the Union Pacific Railroad and sets the “legendary Kwan Kung as foreman of the Chinese laborers building the Central Pacific Railroad” in the 1860s. The book deals with the issue that these Chinese laborers didn’t get the credit they deserved for building the railroad. Although Kwan Kung, who is a famous general of “the late Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms era of China,” (quoted from Kwan Kung's Wikipedia entry) wasn’t actually there when the railroad was built, the building of the railroad by Chinese workers did take place. It also references the lives and treatment of Chinese Americans who lived in Chinatown during the mid/late 20th century. This book altogether deals with “racist U.S. exclusion laws, the nineteenth century exploitation of Chinese laborers, the distortion of classic Chinese philosophy and literature, the erasure of Chinese-American history, [and] the emasculating stereotypes of Chinese in the American media”. Donald Duk earned Chin a 1992 Lannan Literary Award, as well as a selection as one of the Best Books for Young Adults by the New York Public Library. Chin was the first Asian American to receive recognition from the Lannan Foundation.
