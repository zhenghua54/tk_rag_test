The Hedgepethâ€“Williams case was cited in the Supreme Court decision in the "Brown v. Board of Education" case on May 17, 1954. Ten years later, the Honorable Thurgood Marshall and his team of NAACP attorneys applied the Hedgepeth and Williams decision (the only state anti-segregation legal precedent in the Nation) to the successful litigation strategy used in the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court's "Brown v. Board of Education", Topeka KS decision, which overturned the doctrine of "Separate but Equal" across the land.
