Fibromyalgia is a poorly understood pain condition. Lactulose breath testing has shown that patients with fibromyalgia have a more pronounced degree of abnormal results compared to both IBS patients and the general population. This study also demonstrated positive correlation between the amount of pain and the degree of abnormality on the breath test. A subsequent study also demonstrated increased prevalence of intestinal hyperpermeability, which some believe occurs commonly with SIBO. One study showed that nearly all fibromyalgia sufferers have unidentified airway constriction during sleep in the form of Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS)--which is known to cause similar symptoms to fibromyalgia. One explanation being that it results from airway inflammation (as indicated by high Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TnF-A) readings) caused directly or indirectly by SIBO and/or altered intestinal permeability. More research into this possible link is needed.
