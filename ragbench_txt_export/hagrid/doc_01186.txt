In 1984, a plan to provide a museum at Linnwood was advertised. On 21 March 1985, The Department of Community Services granted a license to the Holroyd and District Historical Society, to operate the "Linnwood Museum", from the building. In September of that year, the museum was officially opened by the then Minister for Youth and Community Services, Frank Walker (Pamphlet).
