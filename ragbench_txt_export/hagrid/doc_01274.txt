Manhattan puts Bruce Wayne in contact with the "Flashpoint" Thomas Wayne, who tells his son to not become Batman before his "death" and the destruction of the last of the "Flashpoint" timeline, prompting Bruce to not respond to the Bat-Signal the following night. Manhattan also saves Jor-El from the destruction of Krypton, before conditioning him to see only the very worst of humanity. Jor-El assumes the identity of Mister Oz and tries to convince his son Kal-El, or Superman, to abandon Earth. However, when Jor-El begins to realize that he has been pushing against his son too far, he is pulled away. Superman acknowledges Jor-El's warnings even as he rejects his misanthropy.
