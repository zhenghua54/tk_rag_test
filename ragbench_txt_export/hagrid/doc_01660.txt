In June 1604, 54 of England's most prominent linguists and scholars were commissioned into 6 groups to translate the Bible into English. Thomas took a very prominent part in the translation of the Bible, as a member of the "First Oxford Company", responsible for the translation of the books of the Old Testament prophets from Isaiah to Malachi, in the project to create an Authorized Version of the Bible (King James Version) for reading in the churches. After it was published 2 May 1611, Thomas died 10 Â½ months later aged 63. He had stoutly resisted the "popish innovations" which Richard Bancroft and William Laud strove too successfully to introduce at Oxford.
