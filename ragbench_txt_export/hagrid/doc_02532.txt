"Neighbours" is the winner of both a Canadian Film Award and an Oscar, for the latter of which it was nominated twice, for Short Subject (One-reel) and for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Strangely, it was in the Documentary category that this short, stylized drama won its Oscar. A press release issued by AMPAS states that "Neighbours" is "among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories."
