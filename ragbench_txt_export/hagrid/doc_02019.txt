Bolivia was chosen as a programme country for Denmark in 1994, because Bolivia were the poorest country in South America. Denmark started assisting Bolivia with diaries. Because of the political situation in Bolivia, Denmark suspended the assistance in 1980. In 1993 the cooperation resumed.
Danish development assistance to Bolivia focuses on democracy, human rights, agriculture, education and environment.
In 2005, DANIDA cut the aid from 200 million to 150 million because of the social problems in Bolivia. In 2010, after 13 years of cooperation, the assistance for indigenous people ended.
