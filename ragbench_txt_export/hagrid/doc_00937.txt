A "reimagining" of "Silent Hill", titled "", was developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. The game was released on December 8, 2009, for the Wii and on January 19, 2010, for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable, to mostly positive reviews. Although it retains the premise of a man's search for his missing daughter, "Shattered Memories" branches off into a different plot with altered characters. It features psychological profiling which alters various in-game elements depending on the player's response to questions in therapy, lacks the combat of "Silent Hill", and replaces the "Otherworld" with a series of chase sequences through an alternate frozen version of the town.
