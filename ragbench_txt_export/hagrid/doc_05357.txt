One species, "Sorghum bicolor", native to Africa with many cultivated forms now, is an important crop worldwide, used for food (as grain and in sorghum syrup or "sorghum molasses"), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels. Most varieties are drought- and heat-tolerant, and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people. These varieties form important components of forage in many tropical regions. "S. bicolor" is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth-most important cereal crop grown in the world.
