Production of "Power Rangers" episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original "Super Sentai" source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage, "Power Rangers" programs consist of scenes featuring English-speaking actors spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot (Zord and Megazord) battles with English dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the "Power Rangers" production. Like many of Saban Entertainment previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience, the plot, character names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season.
