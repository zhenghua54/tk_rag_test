In 1975 several residents of the Ten Broeck Triangle formed the Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Association (AHCCA) to lobby the city for improvements in neighborhood services. Many of them lived in the surviving townhouses, which they had often restored themselves. They saw gentrification as the key to revitalizing the neighborhood, due to its proximity to downtown Albany and the growing service-sector jobs there. To further this goal, they worked with preservationists to have the triangle recognized as a historic district. That area was duly listed on the Register in 1978 under that name.
