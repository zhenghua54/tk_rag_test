Asmodeus (; , "Asmodaios") or Ashmedai (; , "ʾAšmədʾāy", Ashema Deva; see below for other variations) is a "king of demons", or in Judeo-Islamic lore the king of the earthly spirits (shedim/jinn), mostly known from the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, in which he is the primary antagonist. In the Binsfeld's classification of demons, Asmodeus represents Lust. The demon is also mentioned in some Talmudic legends; for instance, in the story of the construction of the Temple of Solomon.
