Ghirlandaio is credited as the teacher of Michelangelo. Francesco Granacci is another among his pupils. According to Vasari, these two were sent by Ghirlandaio to the Medici Academy, when Lorenzo de' Medici requested his two best pupils. Although Michelangelo regarded himself primarily as a sculptor, in the 16th century he was to follow his master as a painter of frescos, at the Sistine Chapel.
