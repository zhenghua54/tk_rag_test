Mosander worked teaching chemistry at the Institute and as an assistant in the mineralogical collection of the Swedish Museum of Natural History. In 1836 he succeeded his professor of chemistry during his medical studies, JÃ¶ns Jakob Berzelius, as professor of chemistry and pharmacy in the Karolinska Institute. Mosander discovered lanthanum in 1839 when he partially decomposed a sample of cerium nitrate by heating and treating the resulting salt with dilute nitric acid. In 1843 he discovered terbium and erbium.
