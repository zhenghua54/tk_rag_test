Hayao Miyazaki's manga series "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" (later adapted into an anime film by Studio Ghibli in 1984) depicts a post-apocalyptic future where humanity was wiped out in the "Seven Days of Fire" 1,000 years before the main events. A "Toxic Jungle" threatens the last of humanity. Nausicaä is the princess of The Valley of the Wind who, rather than destroying the Toxic Jungle, decides to study the flora and fauna in the hopes of co-existing with the forest.
