Common plants used to remediate indoor air pollutants include: English ivy ("Hedera helix"), Peace lily ("Spathiphyllum ‘Mauna Loa’"), Chinese evergreen ("Aglaonema modestum"), Bamboo palm ("Chamaedorea seifrizii"), and Chrysanthemum ("Chrysanthemum morifolium"). There are several studies that cite the plant microcosm as a mechanism to reduce indoor VOCs. Controls of just pots alone and just a tray of water suggest that it is the soil microcosm that provides the pollutant sink. The role of the plants is to establish and maintain the species specific root-zone microbial communities. This mechanism was first suggested by Wolverton et al. in 1985. Houseplants also aid in humidity, temperature, and noise control.
