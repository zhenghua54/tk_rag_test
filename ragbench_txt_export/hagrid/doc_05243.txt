Carneada is considered one of Honduras' national dishes, known as "plato t√≠pico" when served in Honduran restaurants. While it is a type of dish, a "carneada" or "carne asada", like its Mexican counterpart, is usually more of a social event with drinks and music centered on a feast of barbecued meat. The cuts of beef are usually marinated in sour orange juice, salt, pepper and spices, and then grilled.
