Lloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. "Cats" (1981) was to become the longest running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years before closing. On Broadway, "Cats" ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, "The Phantom of the Opera".
