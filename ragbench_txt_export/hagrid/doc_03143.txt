In September 1995 Southern received the Gotham Award for lifetime achievement by the Independent Film Producers Association at the age of 71. The "Easy Rider" controversy reared its head again shortly before Southern's death, when Dennis Hopper alleged during an interview on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" that Rip Torn had been replaced because he had pulled a knife on Hopper during their argument in New York in 1968. Torn sued Hopper over the remark, and Southern agreed to testify on Torn's behalf. The case brought to light several of Southern's drafts of the "Easy Rider" screenplay, which effectively ended the dispute over his contributions.
