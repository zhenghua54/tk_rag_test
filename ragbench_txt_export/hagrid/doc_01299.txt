The ABC Chinese–English Dictionary or ABC Dictionary (1996), compiled under the chief editorship of John DeFrancis, is the first Chinese dictionary to collate entries in single-sort alphabetical order of pinyin romanization, and a landmark in the history of Chinese lexicography. It was also the first publication in the University of Hawai'i Press's "ABC" (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series of Chinese dictionaries. They republished the "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary" in a pocket edition (1999) and desktop reference edition (2000), as well as the expanded "ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary" (2003) and dual "ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary" (2010). Furthermore, the "ABC Dictionary" databases have been developed into computer applications such as Wenlin Software for learning Chinese (1997).
