On January 18, 2012, The CW green-lit a pilot for a proposed Green Arrow series with Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg producing. The series, "Arrow", offers a fresh take on the character, and initially does not feature superpowers, as a way to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe. In addition to the character's experiences as the hero Green Arrow, the series also features flashbacks to Oliver's time on the island and the events that shaped him into the hero in the present. Stephen Amell portrays Oliver Queen in the series. It premiered in North America on October 10, 2012, and has aired six seasons. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a seventh season. Oliver Queen has made multiple appearances in the "Arrow" spin-offs "The Flash" and "Legends of Tomorrow" and one episode of "Supergirl" with Stephen Amell reprising the role. Those series are set in a shared universe called the Arrowverse.
