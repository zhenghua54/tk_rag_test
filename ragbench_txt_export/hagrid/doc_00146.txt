In 451 BC, a council of ten distinguished Romans of consular rank was appointed in place of the consuls, for the purpose of drawing up tables of Roman law, based on a combination of ancient traditions and Greek models. One of the decemvirs was Gaius' nephew, Appius Claudius Crassus. In their first year, the decemvirs published ten tables of laws, to the general approval of the people. Since the task for which the decemvirate had been created remained incomplete, it was decided to elect a new college of decemvirs for the following year. Although Appius had affected a mild and agreeable demeanor, and won the trust of the plebeians, his colleagues suspected that he might wish to remain in power, and accordingly they appointed him to name the new college, and resigned their office to set an example.
