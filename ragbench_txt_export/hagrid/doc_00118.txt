Hydrogen is found in the first group and first period in the periodic table, i.e. it is the first element on the periodic table, making it the lightest element. Since hydrogen gas is so light, it rises in the atmosphere and is therefore rarely found in its pure form, H. In a flame of pure hydrogen gas, burning in air, the hydrogen (H) reacts with oxygen (O) to form water (HO) and releases energy.
