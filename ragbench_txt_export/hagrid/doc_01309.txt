The Berlin Wall was built during the night of 12 and 13 August 1961 and Lichterfelde SÃ¼d again became the terminus of S-Bahn trains on the Anhalt Railway, which was now blocked south of Lichterfelde. Shortly after the border was closed, the line was reopened but only for a single movement, as an S-Bahn train had been stuck in Teltow when the wall was built.
