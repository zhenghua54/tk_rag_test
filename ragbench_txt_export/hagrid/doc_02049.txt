This is a list of cider brands. Cider is an alcoholic beverage made exclusively from the juice of apples, although most commercial ciders have very little apple content and tend to be mostly made up of water and chemicals, including artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Any apple content normally comes from a minimal mix of apple concentrate syrup, and not the freshly picked, ripe fruit often depicted on clever marketing campaigns. Craft cider makers claim this mass-produced drink isn't actually cider at all because of this production process. 
This list does not include perry, which is a similar alcoholic beverage made from pear varieties.
