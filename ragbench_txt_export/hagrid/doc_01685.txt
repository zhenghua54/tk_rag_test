Most Filipinos who immigrate to Canada settle in the large urban areas where there are more jobs and a vibrant community life. These areas include: Metro Vancouver, Greater Calgary, Edmonton Capital Region, City of Winnipeg, the Greater Toronto Area and Greater Montreal. According to Statistics Canada seeing the current trend, by 2031, the Fillipino Canadian population is projected to reach between 1.9 and 2.1 million. Much of this growth will be bolstered by high immigration rates, assuming immigration to the United States remains as restricted as it has been. Notably, Canada now has a Filipino population more than twice as large percentage-wise as that of the United States, the Philippines' former colonial master. The majority of Filipino-Canadians are women who make up about 65% of the population.Source: Canada 2011 CensusNational average: 1.9% The entrepreneurial spirit of Filipinos is alive and well in Canada.
