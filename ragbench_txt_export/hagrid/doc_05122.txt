Following the 1996 Summer Paralympics, Olympic Stadium was retrofitted between September 1996 and April 1997 with the synthetic 400 m athletic track and 35,000 seats removed. The new venue, called Turner Field in honor of then-Braves owner and former Goodwill Games founder Ted Turner, opened on April 4, 1997 with a 5–4 win over the Chicago Cubs. Turner Field hosted two games of the 1999 World Series (swept by the Yankees in four games) and the 2000 MLB All-Star Game. On November 12, 2013, The Braves organisation announced that the team would move into a new ballpark located in Cobb County, SunTrust Park, in time for the 2017 season. Then-Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed stated that the stadium site would be redeveloped once the Braves vacated Turner Field. The Braves' final game at Turner Field took place on October 2, 2016, with a 1–0 win over the Detroit Lions. In May 2014, Georgia State University announced its intentions to pursue the Turner Field site for a mixed-use development. One proposed development plan included reconfiguring Turner Field into a 30,000 seat (American) football stadium and building a new baseball field on the footprint of the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, incorporating the wall where Hank Aaron hit his historic 715th home run; an alternate proposal submitted in November 2015 would adaptively reuse portions of the ballpark for a mixed housing and retail development while a new American football-specific stadium would be built to the north along with the aforementioned new baseball field. On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that it had accepted Georgia State's bid for the stadium property. On August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta–Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for Turner Field, and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on November 9, 2016. On January 5, 2017, the sale of Turner Field was officially closed, and the former ballpark was redeveloped into Georgia State Stadium starting in February 2017. The stadium conversion is occurring over multiple phases, with the first phase completed in time for Georgia State's home opener on August 31, 2017.
