Vincent Kennedy McMahon was born on August 24, 1945 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, the younger son of Victoria (n√©e Askew) and Vincent James McMahon. His father left the family when McMahon was still a baby and took his elder son Rod with him, therefore McMahon did not meet him until age twelve. McMahon's paternal grandfather was promoter Roderick James "Jess" McMahon, whose parents were Irish emigrants from County Galway. His paternal grandmother, Rose Davis, was also of Irish descent. McMahon was raised as Vinnie Lupton and spent the majority of his childhood living with his mother and a string of stepfathers. He claimed that one of his stepfathers, Leo Lupton, used to beat his mother and attacked McMahon when he tried to protect her. He said, "It is unfortunate that he died before I could kill him. I would have enjoyed that." He attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia, graduating in 1964. In his early life, he also overcame dyslexia.
