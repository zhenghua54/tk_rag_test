In most cases the functions performed by an analog multiplier may be performed better and at lower cost using Digital Signal Processing techniques. At low frequencies a digital solution is cheaper and more effective, and allows the circuit function to be modified in firmware. As frequencies rise, the cost of implementing digital solutions increases much more steeply than for analog solutions. As digital technology advances, the use of analog multipliers tends to be ever more marginalised towards higher-frequency circuits or very specialized applications.
