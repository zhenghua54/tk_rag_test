Express Yourself was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, "Like a Prayer", on May 9, 1989, with "The Look of Love", from the 1987 film soundtrack "Who's That Girl", on its B-side. When Madonna started work on "Like a Prayer", she considered many options, and thought about the musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came to the realization that as she and her fans were growing up, and it was time for her to move away from the teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and indicative of what was fashionable, and ride the changing trend of music.
