The National Autistic Society said in 2008 that it was "extremely concerned" about possible harmful effects of the devices upon people with autism. Since autism causes auditory hypersensitivity, individuals with this disability can have more intense reactions to this sound, especially if they are also under 25. Since autism can also affect communication skills, some individuals may not be able to communicate their discomfort to caregivers. A supermarket in Longridge, England, removed a mosquito device in 2008 after a campaign by a 19-year-old Paul Brookfield, who has autism. Brookfield contended that the device was causing him pain due to his disability.
