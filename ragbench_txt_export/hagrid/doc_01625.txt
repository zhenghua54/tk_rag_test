Up until the 1990s, the majority of visual novels utilized pixel art. This was particularly common on the NEC PC-9801 format, which showcased what is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games, with a popular example being "Policenauts" in 1994. There have also been visual novels that use live-action stills or video footage, such as several "Sound Novel" games by Chunsoft. The most successful example is "Machi", one of the most celebrated games in Japan, where it was voted No. 5 in a 2006 "Famitsu" reader poll of top 100 games of all time. The game resembled a live-action television drama, but allowing players to explore multiple character perspectives and affect the outcomes. Another successful example is "", which received a perfect score of 40 out of 40 from "Famitsu" magazine.
