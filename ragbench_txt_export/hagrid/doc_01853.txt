In 2000, the reality series "Big Brother" premiered in the United Kingdom and immediately became a ratings success. Following the success of the first series, it was confirmed that a celebrity edition of the show was in the works. "Celebrity Big Brother" aired in March 2001 as a one-time special on Channel 4 in association with the BBC's "Comic Relief" charity telethon. Due to the tie-in with Comic Relief, the first series was partly broadcast on BBC One in the week leading up to the telethon. It lasted for eight days, and was ultimately won by comedian Jack Dee. With the first series proving to be a success, a second series was later confirmed. "Celebrity Big Brother 2" premiered on 20 November 2002, and concluded when Mark Owen was crowned the winner after 10 days in the house. "Celebrity Big Brother" did not air for the next two years, with Channel 4 choosing to air the spin-off series "" in 2003 and "Big Brother Panto" in 2004. In 2005, the show officially returned with its third series, which launched on 6 January. Lasting for a total of eighteen days, the series was won by Mark "Bez" Berry. The fourth edition of the show premiered on 5 January 2006 and was won by Chantelle Houghton, who ironically enough was the only housemate to not be a celebrity. The fifth series launched on 3 January 2007. This series saw Jade Goody, who had rose to fame after appearing on "Big Brother 3", enter the house as a housemate. The fifth series became the most controversial series to date, when accusations of racism towards housemate Shilpa Shetty arose against Goody and other housemates. Shetty ultimately went on to win the series, while Goody was evicted after spending two weeks in the house. Following the controversy surrounding the fifth series, "Celebrity Big Brother" did not air in 2008. It did, however, return in 2009 and 2010, with the 2010 series being announced as the final one.
