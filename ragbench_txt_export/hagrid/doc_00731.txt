The first book presents some of the earliest concept sketches of a number of now-familiar characters of the "Star Wars" universe, including early impressions of the helmet of Darth Vader, the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, Imperial stormtroopers, and the alien clientele of the Mos Eisley Cantina on the planet Tatooine. The concept sketches and matte paintings of Ralph McQuarrie feature heavily, alongside sketches by Joe Johnston, set design drawings by John Barry, costume design sketches by John Mollo, storyboards by Alex Tavoularis and photographs by Bob Seidemann and John Jay. McQuarrie's work was considered highly influential in the production of the first three Star Wars movies; Journalist Jonathan Jones wrote of McQuarrie: ""Looking at his "[McQuarrie's]" paintings, you can recognise that the appeal of this art is similar to that of 19th century Orientalist paintings of harems and sandy vistas."" The illustrations are accompanied by the text of the Revised Fourth Draft of George Lucas's script, "Star Wars Episode IV â€” A New Hope, from the Journal of the Whills", dated January 15 1976. Later chapters feature the artwork of film posters by Tom Jung, Dan Goozee, Drew Struzan, John Berkey, Tom Chantrell, the Hildebrandt Brothers, Howard Chaykin, Wojtek Siudmak and Ralph McQuarrie; and the art of spin-off products such as the Marvel Comics series, "Star Wars"-themed cartoons such as "Berry's World" and "Stan Mack's Real Life Funnies"; and fan art.
