The red wolf's taxonomic status is the subject of ongoing debate. In 1851 the naturalists John James Audubon and John Bachman recognized "Canis lupus rufus" in the southern and southeastern United States. In 1937 the zoologist Edward Alphonso Goldman proposed this wolf to be a new species "Canis rufus". In 1967, the zoologists Barbara Lawrence and William H. Bossert rebutted Goldman's classification as being too heavily based on probable hybrid specimens. In the third edition of "Mammal Species of the World" published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed the red wolf as a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, but due to its uncertain status compromised by recognizing it as a subspecies of the grey wolf "Canis lupus rufus". Since the early 1980s, genetic analysis has been used to debate whether the red wolf is a species or a wolf/coyote hybrid. Commencing in 2016, two studies using whole genome sequencing indicate that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of ancient and complex gray wolf and coyote mixing, with the red wolf possessing 60% coyote ancestry and 40% wolf ancestry.
