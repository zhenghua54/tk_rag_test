Like other European languages, English contains many words derived from Arabic, often through other European languages, especially Spanish. Among them is every-day vocabulary like "sugar" ("sukkar"), "cotton" ("quṭn") or "magazine" (""). More recognizable are words like "algebra" ("al-jabr"), "alcohol" ("al-kuhūl"), "alchemy" ("al-kimiya"), "alkali", "cypher" and "zenith" (see list of English words of Arabic origin).
