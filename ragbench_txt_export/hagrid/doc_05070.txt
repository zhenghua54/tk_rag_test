"Sweet Home Alabama" was a major chart hit for a band whose previous singles had "lazily sauntered out into release with no particular intent". The hit led to two TV rock show offers, which the band turned down. In addition to the original appearance on "Second Helping", the song has appeared on numerous Lynyrd Skynyrd collections and live albums.
