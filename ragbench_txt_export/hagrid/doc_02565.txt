Over 15 species of moths are referred to with the common name oak leafroller, approximately three-fifths from the "Tortricidae" family, but also from four other families. According to the United States Forest Service, "Archips semiferanus" is the "most important oak leafroller" of these species; other common oak leafroller species such as "Archips argyrosplilus" and "Choristoneura fractivittana" are commonly found on oak trees, but do not cause the damage that "A. semiferanus" does.
