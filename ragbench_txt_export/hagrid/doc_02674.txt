In 1936, Donald was redesigned to be a bit fuller, rounder, and cuter, the first to feature this design was the cartoon "Moving Day". He also began starring in solo cartoons, the first of which was January 9, 1937, Ben Sharpsteen cartoon, "Don Donald". This short also introduced a love interest of Donald's, "Donna Duck", who evolved into Daisy Duck. Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, would make their first animated appearance a year later in the April 15, 1938, film, "Donald's Nephews", directed by Jack King (they had been earlier introduced in the Donald Duck comic strip by Al Taliaferro, see below). By 1938, most polls showed that Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse. Disney could, however, help Mickey regain popularity by redesigning him, giving him his most appealing design as production for the "Fantasia" segment "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" began in 1938.
