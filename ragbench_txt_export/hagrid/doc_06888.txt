In the beginning, "Verbotene Liebe" aired weekdays at around 5:55 pm on Das Erste and was followed by fellow soap opera "Marienhof", creating a soap line-up for the network. The line-up proved successful in its early years and showed a lot of contrast. "VL" was labeled as glamor soap, while "Marienhof" showed the working-class of fictional district in Cologne. Becoming a huge success, Das Erste decided to show reruns in the early morning. With a break from about nine months, the network aired the first 250 episodes, who later were labeled as the show's first season.
