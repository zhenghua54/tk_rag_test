At his time as a student at the University of Ottawa, Rock was President of the SFUO (the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa) in 1969. After the announcement of Rock's appointment to President of the University of Ottawa, "The Ottawa Citizen" wrote:
At a time when the university, like other Canadian campuses, is experiencing a resurgence in student activism, Mr. Rock would bring a sensitivity to student issues, said Mr. Mitchell. "This is something that Allan Rock is particularly qualified for, being a former student leader himself."
