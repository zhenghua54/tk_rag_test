While light gun shooters often have a first-person perspective, they are distinct from first-person shooters, which use conventional input devices for movement. It is not clear exactly when the earliest such first-person shooter video game was created. There are two claimants, "Spasim" and "Maze War". The uncertainty about which was first stems from the lack of any accurate dates for the development of "Maze War"â€”even its developer cannot remember exactly. In contrast, the development of "Spasim" is much better documented and the dates more certain. The initial development of "Maze War" probably occurred in the summer of 1973. A single player made their way through a simple maze of corridors rendered using fixed perspective. Multiplayer capabilities, with players attempting to shoot each other, were probably added later in 1973 (two machines linked via a serial connection) and in the summer of 1974 (fully networked).
