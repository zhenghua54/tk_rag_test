The most famous former resident of Manor Road was the Oxford academic and author J. R. R. Tolkien, at No. 3, with his wife Edith and only daughter Priscilla from 1947 to 1950, having moved from 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford. Tolkien typed out "The Hobbit" once and "The Lord of the Rings" twice in the attic here. The Tolkiens moved to 99 Holywell Street for more room.
