Janani Iyer cited the character of Mithravinda played by Kajal in the film as one of her dream roles. Ram Gopal Varma refused to call "Magadheera" a film and instead termed it as an event that comes "once in a blue moon". While commenting on Mahesh Babu's "Aagadu" (2014), he said that "Magadheera" looked like a 750 crore film when compared to "Aagadu" if the latter was a 75 crore film and added, "My comparison between ""Aagadu"" and ""Magadheera"" is mainly because they both are the most expensive films for their own individual times." Reviewing the Tamil film "Anegan" (2014), few critics opined that the film had traces of "Magadheera" mainly due to the theme of reincarnation. The Tamil dubbed version of the Telugu film "Yevadu" (2014), which featured Charan in one of the lead roles and Kajal in a crucial cameo, was titled "Magadheera".
