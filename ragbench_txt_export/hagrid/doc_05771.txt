33rd Street is bisected by The Johns Hopkins University "Homewood" campus. a notable institution of American higher education, considered to be the first modern university in the country. Founded 1876, Hopkins is particularly renowned for its student research program and The Johns Hopkins Hospital, a teaching hospital founded 1889 and School of Medicine, established 1893, in East Baltimore, both affiliated with the university. Johns Hopkins also occupies the building further east along 33rd Street, at Loch Raven Boulevard, formerly used by all-girls Eastern High School, founded 1844 until closed in 1984: a large, H-shaped, red brick, English Tudor Revival/Jacobethan styled building with limestone trim, constructed 1936â€“1938, matching a similar twin structure for the also still all-female Western High School on the westside on Gwynns Falls Parkway, built a decade earlier.
