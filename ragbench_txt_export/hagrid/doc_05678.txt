As a political term, it refers to a number of political projects as advocated by supporters of Catalan independence. These, based on the linguistic fact, argue for the existence of a common national identity that would surpass the limits of each territory covered by this concept and would apply also to the remaining ones. These movements advocate for "political collaboration" amongst these territories. This often stands for their union and political independence. As a consequence of the opposition these political projects have received –notably in some of the territories described by this concept – some cultural institutions avoid the usage of "Països Catalans" in some contexts, as a means to prevent any political interpretation; in these cases, equivalent expressions (such as "Catalan-speaking countries") or others (such as "the linguistic domain of Catalan language") are used instead.
