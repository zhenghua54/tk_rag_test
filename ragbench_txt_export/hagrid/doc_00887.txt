ActorsFCU was incorporated on December 5, 1962. Its initial purpose was to facilitate members of Actors’ Equity Association (AEA) in their pursuit of getting approved for credit. Due to their unpredictable finances and lack of traditionally defined steady employment, actors had regularly been denied this basic, modern necessity. The specific impetus behind the 1962 movement was an incident at a local department store: an AEA member was denied credit specifically due to the fact that he was an actor. This member proceeded to raise the issue at a union meeting and enlisted six men to take up the challenge of starting a credit union for those in the acting profession. These men—Conrad Bain, Anthony Saverino, Robin Craven, Herb Nelson, Theodore Bikel, Angus Duncan, and Bill Ross—formed the Actors Federal Credit Union in 1962 with the help of Leo Schwarz, Field Representative of the New York League of Credit Unions.
