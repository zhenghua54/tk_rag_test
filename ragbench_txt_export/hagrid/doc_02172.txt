Over 100 species reside in the Richmond Nature Park. Amongst the species that live in the nature park, there are at least 13 mammals including shrews, the douglas squirrel, mice, coyotes, and black tailed deer. Migratory birds have also been seen to be living in the park, including a variety of owl species, hawks, eagles, woodpeckers, and many more. Many of the bird species are considered to be "year-round residents", while other bird species are "found seasonally or during migration only". Over the past few decades since the park has been established, the numbers and diversity of the birds have changed with time as the bog-forest has developed and expanded, but there has been especially fewer waterfowl compared to what was there during the 1970s
