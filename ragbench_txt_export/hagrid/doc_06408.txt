The calendar used by the Punjabi people varies by religions. Historically, the Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus have used the Indian Bikrami (Vikrami) calendar which started in 57 B.C. with King Vikramaditya. Punjabi Muslims use the Arabic Hijri calendar. Some festivals in Punjab, Pakistan are determined by the Punjabi calendar, such as Muharram which is celebrated twice, once according to the Muslim year and again on the 10th of harh. The Bikrami calendar is the one the rural (agrarian) population follows in Punjab, Pakistan.
