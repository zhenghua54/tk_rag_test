In 1899, Rubén Darío, who was still legally married to Rosario Murillo, met Francisca Sánchez del Pozo in the Casa de Campo of Madrid. Francisca was from Navalsauz in the province of Ávila and would be his companion through the last years of his life. In April 1900, Darío visited Paris for a second time, commissioned by "La Nación" to cover the Exposition Universelle that took place that year in the French capital city. His chronicles about this topic would later be compiled in the book "Peregrinaciones".
