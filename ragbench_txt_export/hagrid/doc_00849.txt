On June 8, 2010, ABC Family premiered "Pretty Little Liars" – a teen drama based on the series of young-adult mystery novels by Sara Shepard. "Pretty Little Liars" quickly became ABC Family's flagship program, frequently breaking ratings records; by 2014, "Pretty Little Liars" had ranked among the five most-watched scripted series on basic cable among multiple female age demographics, and the second-highest rated cable series among females 12–34. Throughout the year, ABC Family as a whole experienced its highest year-to-year primetime viewership among viewers in the 12-34 and 18-34 demographics. With 4.9 million viewers across its first broadcast and an encore airing, the 2011 premiere of "Switched at Birth" surpassed "Secret Life" as the most-watched series premiere in network history.
