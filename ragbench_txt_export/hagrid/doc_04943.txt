Concerned Jewish people sometimes refer to assimilation (along with abortion within the Jewish community) as a type of Holocaust. This is because assimilation is the leading cause for the shrinkage of almost all Jewish populations in Western countries since World War II. This shrinkage has been called the "Silent Holocaust"  (in comparison to the genocide against Jews during World War II) by communal leaders such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald of the National Jewish Outreach Program, perhaps the best-known popularizer of the phrase. The Jewish community will not be recognizable in 25 to 30 years. 50% of American Jews marry a non-Jew. Better education is associated with lower levels of intermarriage because Jews with a higher education level encounter a marriage market with more Jews.
