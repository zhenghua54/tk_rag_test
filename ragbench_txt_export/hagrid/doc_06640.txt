Following her 1985 departure from "SNL", Louis-Dreyfus appeared in several films, including the Woody Allen-directed "Hannah and Her Sisters" (1986); "Soul Man" (1986), starring C. Thomas Howell; and "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (1989), in which she starred alongside fellow "SNL" alum Chevy Chase. In 1987, Louis-Dreyfus appeared in the NBC sitcom pilot "The Art of Being Nick", an intended spin-off from "Family Ties" starring Scott Valentine. When the pilot did not make it to series, Louis-Dreyfus was retained by producer Gary David Goldberg for a role on his new sitcom "Day by Day", as the sarcastic and materialistic neighbor, Eileen Swift. Premiering in early 1988, "Day by Day" aired for two seasons on NBC before being cancelled.In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's "Seinfeld". She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, "The Seinfeld Chronicles", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally.
