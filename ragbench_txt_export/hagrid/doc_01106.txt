According to The NPD Group, "Rome: Total War" was the 20th-best-selling computer game of 2004. It maintained this position on NPD's annual computer game sales chart for the following year. In the United States alone, the game sold 390,000 copies and earned $16.8 million by August 2006.

The series as a whole, including "Rome", sold 1.3 million units in the United States by August 2006. By 2013, "Rome: Total War" alone had totaled 876,000 sales in the region.
