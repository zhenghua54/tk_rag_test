Both settings are influenced by Russian composers, particularly Rimsky-Korsakov, who had written a "Scheherazade" in 1888. The first composition was heavily influenced by Russian music, the second used a text inspired by Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic poem. The musical relation between the overture and the song cycle is tenuous.
