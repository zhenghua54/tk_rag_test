Many of Essendon's senior players would retire or move on in the following two seasons, however their next Grand Final appearance came three years later, when the Baby Bombers (so named because of the astounding number of players they had under 21) surprised the football world and won the 1993 AFL Grand Final against Carlton. Collingwood did not win another premiership for 20 years, until they defeated St Kilda in 2010.
