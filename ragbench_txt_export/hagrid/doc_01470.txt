Canada's Worst Driver is a Canadian television series on Discovery Channel, based on "Britain's Worst Driver" and is part of the Worst Driver television franchise. The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director of the original "Britain's Worst Driver" series until its cancellation in 2003. O'Sullivan served as executive producer of "Canada's Worst Driver" until his death in April 2017, doubling as executive producer of sister series "Canada's Worst Handyman" until its cancellation in 2011. As such, "Canada's Worst Driver" is considered to be the production company's flagship show and, with 14 seasons aired as of December 2018, the longest-running of any "Worst" series to date. Unlike other "Worst" series around the world, where being a graduate is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, "Canada's Worst Driver" emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and is often more serious than any other "Worst Driver" version around the world, awarding no prizes aside from a trophy at the end of each season for being named the worst (with the exception of season twelve, in which, despite ultimately being named the worst, Krystal McCann wasn't even worthy of being awarded the trophy, leading to Tyler Dupont becoming the first-ever nominee to be awarded the "Final Graduate" trophy), as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain, as other versions are mainly comedic. The series is also aired dubbed in French in Canada as "Les Pires Chauffards Canadiens" on the Z channel. Until 2011, when "Canada's Worst Handyman" was cancelled and later replaced in 2015 with "Blood, Sweat & Tools," "Canada's Worst Driver" and "Canada's Worst Handyman" were the two highest-rated programs on Discovery Channel Canada.
