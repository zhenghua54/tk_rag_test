Some notable original mods and campaigns have been created, such as "Wings of Dawn" which takes place in an anime-style world, and "Blue Planet" which offers a continuation of "Freespace 2", telling of a civil war between Earth and the GTVA. "The FreeSpace Port", sometimes called FSPort, ports the original "Descent: FreeSpaceThe Great War" to the "FreeSpace 2" and SCP engine with many graphical enhancements, and serves as a base for many mods set in the FreeSpace: Great War era, such as "Shrouding the Light" and "Awakenings". "Silent Threat: Reborn" similarly ports the "Silent Threat" expansion for Descent: Freespace into the Freespace 2 SCP engine.
