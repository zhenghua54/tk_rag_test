Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period of time, often annually  GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations.
