The three ships of the class were built in Saint-Nazaire, France at the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyards. The first modern "megaships" to be built, they also were the first series of cruise ships to include a multi-story atrium with glass elevators. They also had a single deck devoted entirely to cabins with private balconies instead of oceanview cabins. The first ship, the "Sovereign of the Seas" launched in 1988, was the world's largest passenger ship in service, breaking the record held by the (originally designed as an ocean liner. "Sovereign" held this distinction until 1990 when "Norway" succeeded her after being refurbished with the addition of two more decks. In 1991, Royal Caribbean International launched a slightly modified sister ship, the "Monarch of the Seas". In 1992, the line launched its third and final sister ship, the "Majesty of the Seas". These ships were among the largest modern cruise ships to sail during the late 1980s and early 1990s. During that time, other major cruise lines also followed suit, building ships that included many of the same features and similar dimensions as the "Sovereign" class. Carnival Cruise Lines launched the "Fantasy" class in 1990, comparable in size to the "Sovereign" class and also featuring a multi-story atrium with glass elevators. Princess Cruises also countered by launching two ships in 1990 and 1991 to compete with the "Sovereign" class, the "Crown Princess" and the "Regal Princess". They also featured an atrium and two decks devoted to cabins with private balconies instead of windowed "oceanview" cabins. Since then, newer and larger ships have exceeded the size of the "Sovereign"-class ships. 'They are less than half the size of the "Freedom"-class ships and about a third the size of "Oasis"-class ships.
