The initial comic-book character called Fighting Yank first appeared in Nedor Comics' "Startling Comics" #10 (September 1941), during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books. He was created by writer Richard E. Hughes and artist Jon L. Blummer. Later artwork was produced by Jack Binder's studio, and by Elmer Wexler.
