Hispanic or Latino was the most commonly reported race or ethnic group in California other than White. Hispanics or Latinos may be of any race, but they report their race as either White or some other race in the vast majority of cases (see Relation between ethnicity and race in census results). They comprised 37.2 percent (13,752,743) of California's total population and comprised the majority of the population in eight counties. Of these counties, Imperial County reported the highest concentration (79.6 percent). Notably, Imperial County also borders Mexico. Of the ten counties which reported the highest concentration of Hispanics or Latinos, all but Monterey County were landlocked. On the other hand, the ten counties which reported the lowest concentrations of Hispanic or Latinos were also all landlocked. None of these counties have populations over 200,000 and their average population was 65,633. The county that reported the lowest concentration of Hispanics or Latinos was Trinity County (6.7 percent) with a population of just 13,711. Although San Diego County also borders Mexico, it nevertheless had a lower percentage of Hispanics or Latinos than nearby counties which don't.
