In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled "Project 880" (now known to be "Avatar") in parallel with another project, "" (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film "Battle Angel" first, followed by "Avatar". However, in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film "Avatar" first. He mentioned that if both films were successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both. "Alita: Battle Angel" eventually began production in 2016 with Cameron writing and producing and Robert Rodriguez directing.
