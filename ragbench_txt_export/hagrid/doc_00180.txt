Miyazaki's work on "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" was inspired by a range of works including Ursula K. Le Guin's "Earthsea", Brian Aldiss's "Hothouse", Isaac Asimov's "Nightfall", and J.R.R Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings". Dani Cavallaro also suggests inspiration from "The Princess Who Loved Insects" folktale, and the works of William Golding. Nausicaä, the character, was inspired in name and personality, by Homer's Phaeacian princess in the "Odyssey". While a connection to Frank Herbert's "Dune" is often made there is no confirmation apart from the name "Ohmu" being a syllabic rendition of the English "worm". Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the polluted world of "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind". Ian DeWeese-Boyd agrees, "Her commitment to love and understanding—even to the point of death—transforms the very nature of the conflict around her and begins to dispel the distorting visions that have brought it about."
