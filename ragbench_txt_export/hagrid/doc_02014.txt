Bolivia was hit with hyperinflation as well. During the 1980s, economist Jeffrey Sachs was sent as a consultant and new President Gonzalo SÃ nchez de Lozada reined in inflation in the 1990s by severely cutting government spending.

They also argue that Bolivia's example vindicates the bad reputation free-market economics acquired in Chile as Bolivia's reforms came after a democratic election.
