The Collingwood Football Club, nicknamed the Magpies or even less formally the Pies, is a professional Australian rules football club playing in the Australian Football League (AFL). Formed in 1892 in the then-working class Melbourne suburb of Collingwood, the club played in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) before joining seven other teams in 1896 to found the breakaway Victorian Football League (now the national AFL). Originally based at Victoria Park, Collingwood now plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground with its training and administrative headquarters located at Olympic Park Oval and the Holden Centre.
