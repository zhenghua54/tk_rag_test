In 1995, after a bidding war with Toon Makers, who wanted to produce an American live-action/animated hybrid adaptation, DIC Productions L.P. (now DHX Media) licensed the first two seasons of "Sailor Moon" for an English-language release in North America. The Mississauga-based Optimum Productions was hired to dub the anime. Bob Summers wrote a new background score. DIC had mandated cuts to content and length, which reduced the first 89 episodes into 82. Their adaptation was created to capitalize on the success of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers".
