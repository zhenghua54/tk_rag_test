In the 1950s, Burey was diagnosed with flu or pleurisy, but was sick for months. She eventually learned that she had lung cancer. She hid her sickness from Marshall for months, as he was leading the case of "Brown v. Board of Education" at the US Supreme Court. After it ruled on May 17, 1954, she told Marshall about her illness. Richard Kluger credits Burey with being one of two people who had been indirectly active but important influencers of the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision, in his book, "Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality" (2011). Burey died of lung cancer on February 11, 1955, her 44th birthday, after 25 years of marriage.
