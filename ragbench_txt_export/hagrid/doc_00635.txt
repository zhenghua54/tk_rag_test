Cannabis sativa L. subsp. "sativa" var. "sativa" is the variety grown for industrial use, while "C. sativa" subsp. "indica" generally has poor fiber quality and female buds from this variety are primarily used for recreational and medicinal purposes. The major differences between the two types of plants are the appearance, and the amount of Î”-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) secreted in a resinous mixture by epidermal hairs called glandular trichomes, although they can also be distinguished genetically. Oilseed and fiber varieties of "Cannabis" approved for industrial hemp production produce only minute amounts of this psychoactive drug, not enough for any physical or psychological effects. Typically, hemp contains below 0.3% THC, while cultivars of "Cannabis" grown for medicinal or recreational use can contain anywhere from 2% to over 20%.
