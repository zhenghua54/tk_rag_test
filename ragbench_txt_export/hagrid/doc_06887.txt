On 4 September 2014, official word broke that "Verbotene Liebe" would return as a weekly series in 2015 as soon as airing on the daily format has stopped. The network ordered 15 episodes and will air the weekly series Fridays at 6:50 PM. The show will introduce a new central character, Mila von Draskow (who has yet to be cast), and still feature members of the Lahnstein family - namely Elisabeth, Ansgar, Sebastian, Tanja, Tristan and Rebecca, original character Charlie Schneider, the Helmke brothers and the younger set around Charlie's nephew Olli who are sharing a flat. Sets like the bistro Schneiders and the bar No Limits will also still be a part of the show. "There will be a new "Verbotene Liebe" with more shooting time, more opulent images and a dense plot. And yet the new look will still deliver intrigue, passion and great feelings - like many fans of "Verbotene Liebe" wished", said ARD coordinator of access primetime Frank Beckmann about the renewal.
