During the 1830s, Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund and his assistants collected fossils in the calcareous caves near the small town of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena, which he named "Hyaena neogaea" in 1839. After more material was found (including canine teeth and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felid, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to name the new genus "Hyaenodon", but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator, he instead named it "Smilodon populator" in 1842. He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of "Smilodon" as ("smilē"), a scalpel or two-edged knife, and "οδόντος" ("odontús"), tooth. This has also been translated as "tooth shaped like double-edged knife". He explained the species name "populator" as "the destroyer", which has also been translated as "he who brings devastation". By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years. Though some later authors used Lund's original species name "neogaea" instead of "populator", it is now considered an invalid "nomen nudum" ("naked name"), as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated. Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies, such as "Smilodontidion riggii", "Smilodon" ("Prosmilodon") "ensenadensis", and "S. bonaeriensis", but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of "S. populator".
