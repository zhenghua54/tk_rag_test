Along with Prof. DeFrancis overseeing the general planning and supervision of the project as well as its detailed operations, a volunteer team of some 50 contributors – including academics, Chinese language teachers, students, lexicographers, and computer consultants – were involved in the myriad tasks of processing dictionary entries, such as defining, inputting, checking, and proofreading. The University of Hawai'i Press published the "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary" in September 1996. UHP republished the original paperback "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary", which had a total 916 pages and was 23 cm. high, into the "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Pocket Edition" (1999, 16 cm.) and hardback "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Desk Reference Edition" (2000, 23 cm.).
