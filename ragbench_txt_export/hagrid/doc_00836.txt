In February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step "back and [re-examine] the "Assassin's Creed" franchise... [and take the] year to evolve the game mechanics and to make sure we're delivering on the promise of "Assassin's Creed" offering unique and memorable gameplay experiences". On the decision, Guillemot said that "Ubisoft started to question the annualized franchise with the release of "Assassin's Creed Unity", and the fact that "Assassin's Creed Syndicate" had "a slower launch than expected". Guillemot added that "by moving away from the annual iterations of the franchise, it will give the "Assassin's Creed" teams more time to take advantage of new engines and technology". "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"s director Ashraf Ismail, commented on an interview that he and the team would be interested in doing an "Assassin's Creed" game in an Ancient Egyptian setting, along with reiterating an earlier statement that a female leading character was not an impossibility for the series. In May 2017, Ubisoft confirmed the development of "Assassin's Creed Origins". It was announced to be set in the Ptolemaic Egypt in June 2017. The game was released worldwide on October 27, 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows.
