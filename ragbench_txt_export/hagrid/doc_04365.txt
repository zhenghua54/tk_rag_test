There are several explanations about the etymology of this name:
Although the city's name has always been pronounced "Kolkata" [ˈkolkat̪a] () or "Kôlikata" [ˈkɔlikat̪a] () in Bengali, the anglicised form "Calcutta" was the official name until 2001, when it was changed to "Kolkata" in order to match Bengali pronunciation.
