In January 2016, "Ceremony", his third book, was published featuring a project he worked on in 2006 photographing the ceremonial troops of the British Army. McLellan documented the ceremonial soldiers of the British Army with their full support for a feature in "Arena Homme Plus" magazine (Issue 26, Winter/Spring 06/07). The images capture the soldiers as part of the famous Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, and also off duty grooming their horses, prepping their uniforms, and at ease in their barracks. "Ceremony" is a document of both the ceremonial side of the British Army, and also the incredible discipline required to maintain its powerful and cherished traditions. Proceeds from the book will be donated to ABF - The Soldiers' Charity.
