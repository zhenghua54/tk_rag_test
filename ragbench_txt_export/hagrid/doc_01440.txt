The Junta was a pre-planned part of the programme of the "Movimento das Forças Armadas" (Movement of the Armed Forces; MFA), which aimed to exercise political power before the formation of a civilian government in order to prevent the immediate collapse of the Presidency of the Republic (then held by Rear-Admiral Américo Tomás) and of the government, along with the dissolution of the National Assembly and of the Council of State. Constitutional Law 1/74 of 25 April was promulgated in order to set this process in motion. The choice of President and Vice-President remained with the Junta itself.
