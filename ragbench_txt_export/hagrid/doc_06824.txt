Inspired by the real-life case of the Gainesville Ripper, "Scream" was influenced by Williamson's passion for horror films, especially "Halloween" (1978). The script, originally titled "Scary Movie", was bought by Dimension Films and was retitled by the Weinstein Brothers just before filming was complete. The production faced censorship issues with the Motion Picture Association of America and obstacles from locals while filming on location. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $173Â million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing slasher film until the release of "Halloween" (2018). It still remains the highest-grossing slasher film in adjusted dollars. It received several awards and award nominations. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami was also acclaimed, and was cited as "[one] of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years". It has since earned "cult status". "Scream" marked a change in the genre as it cast already-established and successful actors, which was considered to have helped it find a wider audience, including a significant female viewership.
