Yoshida eventually joined Square Enix in 2004 and became the head of the "" series as well as a game designer of "Dragon Quest X" in its early stages. In December 2010, he was taken off the "Dragon Quest" team and placed in charge of the staff that developed the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) "Final Fantasy XIV", which had been unsuccessful since its launch several months before. Then company president Yoichi Wada attributed this decision to Yoshida's experience, "charismatic" leadership skills and "passionate" will to satisfy customers.

Yoshida drew some inspiration from his long-lasting enthusiasm for MMORPGs, having played such titles as "Ultima Online", "EverQuest", "Dark Age of Camelot", "World of Warcraft", "Warhammer Online", "Rift", "" and "Guild Wars 2". As a result of his direction, reviewers and commentators have credited Yoshida with "rescuing" the "Final Fantasy XIV" project.
