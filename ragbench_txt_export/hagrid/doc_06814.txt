After the [[Battle of San Jacinto|final engagement at San Jacinto]] in 1836, there were two different visions of the future of Texas: one as a state of the United States and the other as an independent republic. [[Sam Houston]] promoted the first, as he felt that the newly independent country, lacking hard currency and still facing threats from Mexico, could not survive on its own. The other was promoted by second Texas president [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], who felt that it was Texas's destiny to be a nation that extended from the [[Louisiana]] border to the Pacific Ocean. For this reason, Lamar is considered the father of Texas nationalism.
