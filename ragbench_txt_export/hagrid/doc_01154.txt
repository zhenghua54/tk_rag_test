The series consists of thirteen fifteen-minute episodes (though four exist as twenty-minute episodes on the "Tugs" videos), each told by the show's narrator, Captain Star (voiced by Patrick Allen). Filming and production of the series took place throughout 1987 and 1988, in Shepperton Studios, Middlesex, where "Thomas & Friends" was also filmed at the time. The series was animated using live-action models, which were seen as the most realistic method of portraying real tugboats. The set featured the Clearwater Periscope lens system, a type of professional video camera used to film at the models' eye level.
