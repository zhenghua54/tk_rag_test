The entity referred to most frequently as the Man in Black (referred to as the Smoke Monster or simply the Monster by the main characters) is a fictional character and the main antagonist on the American ABC television series "Lost". He appeared primarily as a cloud of black smoke ("The Smoke Monster") until the final episode of season five, where he appeared as a middle-aged man dressed in black. In season six, he primarily appeared in the physical form of John Locke. He exhibited the ability to "scan" the minds and memories of others, allowing him to confront characters such as Mr. Eko and Ben, with "judgment" (a replay of their pasts), and to assume the forms and memories of the deceased, starting with the original Man in Black himself, being Jacob's brother, or Christian, Yemi, Alex, and Locke. According to Jacob, who explains this to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), it is the incarnation of evil, and its primary goal—to escape from the island—would be the "end of everything good".
