The segments featuring the tugboats in the harbour used footage from the British television series "TUGS", a series produced in 1988 by Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton, who (along with Britt Allcroft) produced the popular series "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends". Whilst Allcroft drove the Thomas series to popularity among American audiences (through the PBS series "Shining Time Station"), "Tugs" did not spread far beyond its country of origin, lasting one season of 13 episodes (although it was aired and merchandised in the Japanese and Australian markets).
