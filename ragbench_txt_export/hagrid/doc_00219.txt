The Umayyad Caliphate (, translit. "al-Khilāfatu al-ʾUmawiyyah"), also spelt , was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Muhammad. The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (, "al-ʾUmawiyyūn", or , "Banū ʾUmayya", "Sons of Umayya"), hailing from Mecca. The third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656), was a member of the Umayyad clan. The family established dynastic, hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of Syria, who became the fifth Caliph after the end of the First Muslim Civil War in 661. After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflicts over the succession resulted in a Second Civil War and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan. Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital.
