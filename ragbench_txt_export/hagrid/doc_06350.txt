McMahon had two sons; Roderick James McMahon III, and Vince McMahon with his first wife Vicky H. Askew (born 1920) in 1945. McMahon married his second wife, Juanita W. Johnston (December 20, 1916 â€“ January 19, 1998), and the couple lived in Fort Lauderdale, but McMahon would not live to see his company grow from a territorial promotion to what is now a worldwide organization. On May 24, 1984, McMahon died at age 69, and is buried in Our Lady Queen of Heaven Catholic Cemetery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
