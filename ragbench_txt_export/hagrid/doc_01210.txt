According to the National Resources Defense Council, cancer causing pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde, and diesel have been found in the air near fracking sites. These pollutants generate wastewater, which is linked to groundwater contamination, threatening nearby drinking water and causing concern for anyone who is exposed. Studies done by The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, found that “Fracking also uses crystalline silica, which is a type of sand that’s used to keep the fractures open.” Exposure to this, along with dust and other air pollutants produced from fracking, can cause respiratory problems.
