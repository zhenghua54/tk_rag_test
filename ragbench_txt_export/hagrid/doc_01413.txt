In 2016, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV ran a series of "Charmed" articles in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the series finale. The eighth was a complete season review of season eight, posted on the day of the 10th anniversary of the series finale. Gavin comments that the season suffers from its budget cut, saying "I blame budget more than anything else for the reason season 8 felt less magical than most of the previous seasons". He highlighted 'Forever Charmed' as the best episode of the season, while also saying he respected the writers since they "still managed to deliver 22 episodes of hit-and-misses, but for me, a lot of it was good".
