Veterinarians also administer transfusions to other animals. Various species require different levels of testing to ensure a compatible match. For example, cats have 3 known blood types, cattle have 11, dogs have 12, pigs 16 and horses have 34. However, in many species (especially horses and dogs), cross matching is not required before the "first" transfusion, as antibodies against non-self cell surface antigens are not expressed constitutively â€“ i.e. the animal has to be sensitized before it will mount an immune response against the transfused blood.
