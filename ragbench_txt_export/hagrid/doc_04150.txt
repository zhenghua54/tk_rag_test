When World War I erupted in 1914, "France" was immediately requisitioned by the French Navy for use as an armed merchant cruiser and renamed "France IV". Her time as a cruiser was short-lived as she was too large, burned too much coal to be of good use, and was consequently reconfigured to carry troops. On 18 June 1916, "France" was involved in a collision with the British destroyer in the English Channel. "Eden" sank with the loss of 43 officers and men, including her commander, with "France" rescuing the remaining 33 survivors. Later that year, she was painted white and used as a hospital ship in the Dardanelles, operating in tandem with White Star's new flagship, and Cunard's new . During her time as a hospital ship she was converted to accommodate 2,500 injured troops. When "Britannic" was sunk in late 1916, the need for high-capacity hospital ships was even more dire, and she continued in this role until the United States entered the war in 1917, when she was deployed back to the Atlantic to ferry American troops to the continent with space for some 5,000. In 1918, her military service was cut short by an engine room explosion that killed nine crew members and thus required extensive repairs.
