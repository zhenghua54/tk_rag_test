In 1929, Salvador Lutteroth, who at the time was a property inspector for the Mexican Tax department, moved to Ciudad Ju√°rez near the Mexico/U.S. border. During a trip to El Paso, Texas Lutteroth witnessed a professional wrestling show and was intrigued by the show and especially the main event Greek wrestler Gus Pappas. Four years later Lutteroth, along with his financial backer Francisco Ahumada chartered "Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre" (EMLL; The "Mexican Wrestling Enterprise"), the first Mexican owned wrestling promotion in the country. EMLL held their first shown on September 21, 1933, considered the "birth of Lucha libre" and led to Lutteroth being known as "the father of Lucha Libre" .
