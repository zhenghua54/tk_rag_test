Apple released the first advertisement for the iPhone in February 2007 during the national broadcast of the Academy Awards. The 30-second commercial featured cuts of famous figures answering their telephones, all saying “Hello”. As it progressed, the ad showed more recent versions of the telephone; it ended with a preview of the first generation iPhone to draw a connection between the iPhone and the newest technology available. To accompany the initial sneak peek at their latest product, Apple released several new ads for the iPhone through “television, web-based, and print ads designed to show off the disappearing and reappearing touch keypad”. Other features included in those advertisements were email, camera, and general touchscreen capabilities.
