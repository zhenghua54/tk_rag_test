In 2002, after noticing the popularity of a medical spa offering Botox and laser hair-removal services in a Las Vegas, Rudnick took an interest in the retail cosmetics industry. The FDA approved Botox the same year, and Rudnick spotted a demand for convenient, competitively priced Botox treatments. At the time, Rudnick was running a weight loss medical clinic; however, he dropped the weight loss part of his business to focus on laser and skin care treatments as they were more scalable in a retail environment. Rudnick opened the first Sleek MedSpa in Boston and seven locations in Florida. In 2006 Sleek MedSpa acquired SkinKlinic, which became Sleek’s first location in Manhattan. The same year Rudnick moved Sleek’s headquarters to Boca Raton, Florida.
