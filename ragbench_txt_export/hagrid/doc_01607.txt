Ruth Laredo died on May 25, 2005 in her sleep in her Manhattan apartment. The cause of death was ovarian cancer, a diagnosis which was made four years before her death but which did not stop her from giving concerts. She is buried in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York, only a few meters away from the grave of Sergei Rachmaninoff, who was so important to her life. At the funeral on May 31, 2005, two of her closest colleagues performed: Wei Gang Li from the Shanghai Quartet, and Courtenay Budd, with whom – along with the St. Petersburg String Quartet – she had given her last “Concert with Commentary” on May 6, 2005.
