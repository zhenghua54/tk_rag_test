Joseph Stalin, who had been in Soviet administration throughout the Russian Civil War and its aftermath, well remembered how the attempt to fight Bolshevik-style revolutions throughout Europe during and after World War I—the revolutions of 1917–23—had mostly failed. (Many Old Bolsheviks had thought at the time that these revolutions were the vanguard of the world revolution, but the latter never materialized.) It was this very reality that had driven the development of the idea of Socialism in One Country as the Soviet Union's own path. With such historical lessons in mind, at the end of World War II Stalin suggested to the leaders of Eastern European communist parties that they should present themselves as advocates of a "people's democracy". After the defeat of Nazi Germany and its allies in Eastern Europe, Marxist–Leninist theoreticians first began expanding on the idea of a possible peaceful transition to socialism, given the presence of the Soviet Red Army. In most areas of Eastern Europe, the Communist Parties did not immediately take power directly but instead worked in Popular Coalitions with progressive parties. Unlike the Soviet Union, which was officially a one-party state, a majority of people's democracies of Eastern Europe were theoretically multi-party states. Many of the ruling Leninist parties no longer called themselves Communist in their official title as they had in the 1930s. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany for instance was ostensibly a union of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany. Many of the other European states were ruled by Worker's or Socialist Parties. In the Eastern Bloc, "People's democracy" was a synonym for socialist state.
