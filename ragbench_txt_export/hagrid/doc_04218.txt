Further controversy surrounds the difference in composition dates between the "Iliad" and "Odyssey". It seems that the latter was composed at a later date than the former because the works' differing characterizations of the Phoenicians align with differing Greek popular opinion of the Phoenicians between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, when their skills began to hurt Greek commerce. Whereas Homer's description of Achilles's shield in the "Iliad" exhibits minutely detailed metalwork that characterized Phoenician crafts, they are characterized in the "Odyssey" as "manifold scurvy tricksters".
