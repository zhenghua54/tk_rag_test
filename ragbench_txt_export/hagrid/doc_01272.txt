While Wonder Woman battles Mongul, whose power and strength exceed hers, Batman and Robin try to free Superman. Meanwhile, Superman's fantasy takes a dark turn. His father Jor-El's prediction of Krypton's doom was unfulfilled, leading to Jor-El being discredited and embittered. Superman's mother Lara has died from the "Eating Sickness", which has further isolated Jor-El from his son and the rest of his family. Even the death of his brother Zor-El has not reconciled him to his sister-in-law Alura and niece Kara Zor-El.
