Lindburgh's flight was not the first transatlantic flight; [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|John (Jack) Alcock and Arthur Brown achieved that]] goal in 1919, traveling from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], to [[Clifden]], [[County Galway]], Ireland, in response one of the [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|"Daily Mail" aviation prizes]]. Lindbergh's flight, almost twice the distance, was, however, the first solo, non-stop [[transatlantic flight]], and one made between two major cities, and by a man barely 25 years of age. Lindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for the feat, and many other awards and other forms of recognition from many countries. Lindbergh's achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity.
