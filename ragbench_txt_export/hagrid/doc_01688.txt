Steinbeck was known to have borrowed from field notes taken during 1938 by Farm Security Administration worker and author Sanora Babb. While Babb collected personal stories about the lives of the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing, her supervisor, Tom Collins, shared her reports with Steinbeck, then working at the "San Francisco News". Babb's own novel, "Whose Names Are Unknown", was eclipsed in 1939 by the success of "The Grapes of Wrath" and was shelved until it was finally published in 2004, a year before Babb's death. "The Grapes of Wrath" developed from "The Harvest Gypsies", a series of seven articles that ran in the "San Francisco News", from October 5 to 12, 1936. The newspaper commissioned that work on migrant workers from the Midwest in California's agriculture industry. (It was later compiled and published separately.)
