The Faculty of Medicine was one of the original four faculties constituting the University of Freiburg when it was founded in 1457. At first, the faculty consisted of only a single professor and few students. Medical education in the early modern era was mainly marked by theory and the reading of texts from classical and Arabic works that had been translated to Latin. As was common at the time, little emphasis was placed on patient care and bedside teaching in the curriculum and academic medicine shared the health care market with other professions such as barber surgeons, midwives, and lithtomists. During the period of enlightened absolutism, a new interest by the state in philanthropy saw the founding of several secular hospitals, a development which also revolutionized the medical curricula. Clinical classes were introduced and the university's first own clinic was founded in 1751.
