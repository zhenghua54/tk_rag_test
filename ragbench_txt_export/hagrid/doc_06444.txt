The Seven Sistersâ€”fictional characters of the "Forgotten Realms" campaign setting of the "Dungeons & Dragons" Role Playing Game. The sisters are epic level characters (characters possessing nearly super-human levels of skill and power) of differing abilities, most of which involve some form of spellcasting and use of magic. Created by Ed Greenwood, they have been featured in multiple novels, games, and officially created scenarios by an equally large number of authors/game-designers.
