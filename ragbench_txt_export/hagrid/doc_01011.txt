Pathologist Alfred Whitmore and assistant Krishnaswami first reported the disease among beggars and morphine addicts at autopsy in Rangoon, present-day Myanmar, in a report published in 1912. They distinguished it from glanders, a disease of humans and animals that is similar in presentation, but caused by a different micro-organism. "B.Â pseudomallei", also known as the Whitmore bacillus, was identified in 1917 in Kuala Lumpur. Arthur Conan Doyle may have read the 1912 report before writing a short story that involved the fictitious tropical disease "tapanuli fever" in a Sherlock Holmes adventure.
