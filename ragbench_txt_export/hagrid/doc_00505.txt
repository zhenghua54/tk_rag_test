I-75 is the longest Interstate Highway within Georgia. It enters near Valdosta, and it continues northward through the towns of Tifton and Cordele until it reaches the Macon area, where it intersects with I-16 eastbound towards Savannah. For northbound traffic wishing to avoid potential congestion in Macon, I-475 provides a relatively straight bypass west of that city and I-75's route.
