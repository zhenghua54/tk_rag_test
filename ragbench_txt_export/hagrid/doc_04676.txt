Cybertron is a fictional planet, the homeworld of the Transformers in the various fictional incarnations of the metaseries and toyline by Hasbro. In the Japanese series, the planet is referred to as "Cybertron" (first shown on Japanese "Galaxy Force" packaging, although "Cybertron" is the Japanese name for "Autobot") pronounced as Sabertron セイバートロン "Seibātoron". Cybertron is populated by mechanical self-configuring modular lifeforms of variable size who can transform into all kinds of machinery. These are called Cybertronians, or Transformers.
