Shortly after the release of "Feed Me Weird Things", Squarepusher released his first music for Warp Records in the form of the "Port Rhombus EP" in 1996. Jenkinson signed a multi-album deal with Warp and the label would become his long-time and primary home. The "Vic Acid" EP was released in 1997, followed by his sophomore full-length, "Hard Normal Daddy". Later that year, Warp and Sypmania would co-release "Burningn'n Tree", which compiled the "Conumber E:P" and "Alroy Road Tracks", alongsing three previously unreleased tracks.
