The North was the center of shipping and trading, and had the largest French elite population, the "grands blancs". The rich white colonists wanted greater autonomy for the colony, especially economically. The Plaine-du-Nord on the northern shore of Saint-Domingue was the most fertile area, having the largest sugar plantations and therefore the most slaves. It was the area of greatest economic importance, especially as most of the colony's trade went through these ports. The largest and busiest port was Le Cap-Français (present-day Le Cap-Haïtien), the capital of French Saint-Domingue until 1751, when Port-au-Prince was made the capital. In this northern region, enslaved Africans lived in large groups of workers in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by the high mountain range known as the "Massif du Nord". These slaves would join with urban slaves from Le Cap to lead the 1791 rebellion, which began in this region.
