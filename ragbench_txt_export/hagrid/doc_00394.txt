The judiciary organization reform of 2014 simplified the judicial division of Portugal, that until then included 231 "comarcas", grouped in 57 "c√≠rculos judiciais" (judicial circles), by themselves grouped in four "distritos judiciais" (judicial districts). Depending of the size of its population, each "comarca" could have from a single judicial court of generic competence to a complex structure of diverse courts of specific competences (civil, criminal, criminal procedure, labor, family, etc.).
