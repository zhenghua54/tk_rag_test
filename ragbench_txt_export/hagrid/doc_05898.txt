Suleiman I (1494 â€“ 1566), was the tenth Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until his death. He was the son of Selim I. Suleiman I was considered one of the Empire's greatest rulers, and was known in the West as Suleiman the Magnificent, as his reign engineered the Golden Age of Constantinople. He was also known by his fellow Turks as Kanuni or the Law Giver. Suleiman became embroiled in the struggle between the Templars and Assassins during 1511. After a failed kidnap attempt by Byzantine Templars working for Manuel Palaiologos, Suleiman befriended the Italian Assassin and Mentor, Ezio Auditore, who encouraged Suleiman's progressive attitude for peace in the Ottoman Empire.
