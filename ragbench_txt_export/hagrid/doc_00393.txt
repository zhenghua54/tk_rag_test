The Judicial order ("Ordem Judicial") is the first category of common courts (excluding the Constitutional Court), forming a proper hierarchical structure that has the Supreme Court of Justice ("Supremo Tribunal de Justiça") in Lisbon as its superior body. This order also includes the five intermediate level courts called "Relação" (Guimarães, Oporto, Coimbra, Lisbon and Évora) and the judicial courts of first instance. The judicial courts of first instance can be courts of generic competence or courts of specific competence.
