In the United States, technologist certification requires a bachelor's degree in an engineering technology program accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ETAC/ABET). One may also obtain a degree from an institution accredited through The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (formerly known as the National Association of Industrial Technology). Technologist registration in the United States is conducted by many independent societies and organizations. A government-sponsored registration is opposed by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) and NSPE. As a result, the profession is often not seen as an independent field separate from design engineering.
