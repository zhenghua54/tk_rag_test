The government of Canada has not acknowledged Pimicikamak's customary government in modern times. Its policy is that self-government is an inherent right of aboriginal peoples in Canada and that this right is recognized and affirmed by the Constitution of Canada. "The federal government supports the concept of self-government being exercised by Aboriginal nations or other larger groupings of Aboriginal people." but does not accept that an aboriginal people may exercise this right without first negotiating it. Negotiation and legislation of self-government can result in domestic, dependent status similar to that of Indian nations in the United States of America, whose governments are defined by Act of Congress. Canada has not generally accepted Pimicikamak's policy of exercising its inherent right.
The government of Canada prefers to deal with Cross Lake First Nation, a domestic, dependent, municipal form of government established by Act of Parliament. Under this federal legislation and the terms of various agreements, the Band Council acts as the agent of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in delivering programs to Indians on reserve.
Since 1999, several Band Councils have taken and held office pursuant to the "Pimicikamak Election Law, 1999" instead of the federal legislation.
