In mid-2011, Sony announced that they were again restructuring RCA/JIVE Label Group. The JIVE side split, and LA Reid was hired to head Epic Records, which was restructured to focus on urban music. JIVE Records was moved under RCA Music Group, minus those artists who were moved to Epic. Some of JIVE's urban artists such as Usher moved to RCA, while other JIVE pop artists, including Britney Spears & P!nk, stayed under JIVE as the label moved under the RCA Music Group. Peter Edge serves as CEO of the company. The company was expected to start releasing all of its recordings under RCA Records. Arista Records, J Records and JIVE Records have been shut down in October 2011 with all of their artists moving to RCA. In August 2011, RCA laid off 20 members of its staff.
