On Demon Island, the two groups have to defeat the demon king's Devas. The first two are played by real-life people who work for the company. One of them turns out to be Myriah (using the form of the demon Pristina), and she faces off with the party of Il-Barn, Capri, Boromir, and Ah-Dol. On the other hand, just as they (Lotto, Yureka, Aradon, and Olios) are about to lose, Basara appears and proceeds to kill the masked Deva. Lotto makes a deal with Basara which he (Basara) agrees to. The deal is that Basara can kill all the monsters and that they (Lotto, Yureka, Aradon, and Olios) will finish off his "leftovers" or complete the quest if Basara were to die. They continue on to meet the next Devaâ€”Cube. Roto then leaves Basara to fight Cube and heads for the entrance to the demon king's room along with Yureka, Aradon, and Olios. Basara stops him from doing so, causing Lotto to fall. Yureka jumps down to save Lotto. As Basara is turned to stone by Cube, Aradon and Olios leave Lotto and Yureka to fight Cube.
