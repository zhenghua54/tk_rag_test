At one time this canid was proposed by some authors as a subspecies of the red wolf - the red wolf once lived primarily in Texas - and that a variation in the red wolf's coloring led to the creation of the Florida black wolf. A red colored species, known as the Florida red wolf, once resided in Florida as well, though it also became extinct in 1921. It was believed by one author that both species, instead of being a subspecies of the red wolf, were actually a type of coyote, which led to the change in the trinomial name to "Canis niger niger".
