Bibimbap ( , from Korean "bibimbap" , literally "mixed rice"), sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish. The term “bibim” means mixing various ingredients, while the “bap” noun refers to rice. "Bibimbap" is served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with "namul" (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) and "gochujang" (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or "doenjang" (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish is stirred together thoroughly just before eating.
