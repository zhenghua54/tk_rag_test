During an interview with Alfonso Cuar√≥n in July 2013, Cameron set 2017 as the date at which production on the film would begin. In October 2015, "The Hollywood Reporter" reported that director Robert Rodriguez was in negotiations to direct the film, now titled "Alita: Battle Angel", and Cameron would be attached as producer alongside Jon Landau. Rodriguez had been brought in by Cameron to condense and combine Cameron's 186-page screenplay and some 600 pages of notes into what could be the shooting script. Satisfied by Rodriguez's work on the shooting script, Cameron offered him the directing job.
