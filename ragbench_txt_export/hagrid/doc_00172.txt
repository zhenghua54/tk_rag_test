Three video games were released based on the manga and the film. All three of the titles were developed by Technopolis Soft and published by Technopolis Soft and Tokuma Shoten. "Nausica채 in the Nick of Time" also known as "Nausica채's Close Call" ("Naushika Kiki Ippatsu" or "Nausica채 Kiki Ippatsu") is a Japanese shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Technopolis Soft for the NEC PC-6001 computer system in 1984. The game marketed as "Nausica채 of the Valley of the Wind" and known by its title screen as , is an adventure game developed by Technopolis Soft for the NEC PC-8801: it was released in the 1980s, most likely 1984. The third game, for the MSX is the most well-known of the releases and has been frequently and erroneously referred to as a game where the player kills the Ohmu. These games signaled the end of video game adaptations for Hayao Miyzaki's films. The only other games based on Miyazaki films were the LaserDisc arcade game "Cliff Hanger" and the MSX2 platform-adventure game "Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro", both of which were based on "The Castle of Cagliostro". Luke Plunkett describes these "two awful adaptations" as the reason Miyazaki does not allow further video game adaptations of his films.
