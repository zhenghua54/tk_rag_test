"King of the Hill" received critical acclaim over its 13-year run. Early reviews of the show were positive. Diane Holloway at the "Chicago Tribune" considered it the "most Texan television series since "Dallas"," and praised the show's "sly sense of humor and subversive sensibility." At the "Los Angeles Times", writer Howard Rosenberg suggested that the show "totes a few smiles, but [there's] little to bowl you over, and it takes a spell getting used to."
