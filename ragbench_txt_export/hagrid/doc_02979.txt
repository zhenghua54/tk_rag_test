The following year, in the case known as "Brown II", the Court ordered segregation to be phased out over time, "with all deliberate speed". "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas" (1954) did not overturn "Plessy v. Ferguson" (1896). "Plessy v. Ferguson" was segregation in transportation modes. "Brown v. Board of Education" dealt with segregation in education. "Brown v. Board of Education" did set in motion the future overturning of 'separate but equal'.
