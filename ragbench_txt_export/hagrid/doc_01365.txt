After the Luftwaffe's specialist ground attack aircraft, the Junkers Ju 87, suffered heavy losses in attacks on Britain, it was decided to use modified Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Messerschmitt Bf 110 as fighter-bombers. The first unit equipped with these aircraft, "Erprobungsgruppe" 210, began conducting operations against shipping in the English Channel in the third week of July. The unit began operations against ground targets on 12 August, when aircraft from its three squadrons ("staffel") simultaneously attacked radar stations near Dover, Pevensey, Rye and Dunkirk. The unit continued fighter-bomber operations throughout July, but suffered heavy losses during raids on inland targets; casualties among the Bf 110s were particularly high, and it became clear that these large and relatively slow aircraft were not suited to the fighter-bomber role. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe decided to expand its fighter bomber force, and an additional group equipped with modified Bf 109s became active in August. On 2 September Hermann Göring, the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, directed that one squadron of each Bf 109 group was to be equipped with fighter-bombers, and that these aircraft were to be used to attack the British aircraft industry and other industrial facilities.
