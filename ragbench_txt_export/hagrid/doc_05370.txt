Hoya Saxa is the official cheer and "college yell" of Georgetown University and its athletics teams. The term "Hoya" is an Ancient Greek word usually transliterated from as "hoia" from the word "hoios" () meaning "such" or "what" as in "what manner of", and is used in certain Biblical quotations. "" is Latin for "rocks" or "small stones". It was used in the name of some Roman settlements, such as Saxa Rubra. Before 1900, students at Georgetown were required to study classical linguistics, and both words are in the neuter plural of their respective languages. The phrase together is generally translated into English as "what rocks!", though other translations have suggested "such rocks!" or "great rocks!" or even "what rocks?" as a question. It was also historically rendered as "Hoya, Hoya, Saxa!", a form that is used in "The Hoya Song" from 1930 which mocked the cheers of other universities, and was then included in the school fight song, "There Goes Old Georgetown".
