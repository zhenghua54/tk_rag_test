The code-name "Weapon X" was originally mentioned in the first appearance of Wolverine in "The Incredible Hulk" #180, in 1974, since which, it had been implied that he was connected to a shady and malevolent government program. In the 1991 "Marvel Comics Presents" story arc "Weapon X," the project was designated Experiment X, and it was revealed that it was responsible for bonding the adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton, making him indestructible. It also subjected him to brainwashing in order to bring out his most basic murderous instincts and to transform him into the perfect assassin. The scientists christened their new killing machine "Weapon X".
