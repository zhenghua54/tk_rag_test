A version of "Disgaea: Hour of Darkness", including the added content in "Afternoon of Darkness", was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam on February 24, 2016, retitled as "Disgaea PC". The initial release was panned by critics on launch due to its many bugs, which included persistent crashes, save file loss, and poor performance, even on high-end PCs. A patch was released soon afterwards that fixed many of the bugs. Another patch was released for the game later that added the four characters previously exclusive to "Disgaea DS". Players who bought the game during the 2016 Steam Summer Sale would also earn free in-game cosmetic items for Valve Corporationâ€™s first person shooter game Team Fortress 2.
