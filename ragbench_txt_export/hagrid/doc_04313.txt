Missulena occatoria, known as the red-headed mouse spider, is found in Southern Australia, from open forests to desert shrublands. It is the largest (females up to 24 mm, males up to 12 mm) and most widely distributed "Missulena" species, because the spiderlings are wind-dispersed (ballooning). Normally this only occurs with araneomorph spiders, mygalomorph spiders normally disperse by walking. "Missulena" venom may be very toxic, but few cases of serious envenomation have been recorded. Most recorded bites only caused minor effects, with Australian funnel-web spider antivenom having proved effective as a treatment.
