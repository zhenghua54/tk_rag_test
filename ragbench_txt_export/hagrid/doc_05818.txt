The Anglican Church of Australia is a Christian church in Australia and an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. It is the second largest church in Australia, after the Roman Catholic Church. According to the 2016 census, 3.1Â million Australians identify as Anglicans. For much of Australian history, the Church of England (now known as the Anglican Church of Australia) was the largest religious denomination. It remains today one of the largest providers of social welfare services in Australia.
