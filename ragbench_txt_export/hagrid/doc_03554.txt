González Camarena invented the "Chromoscopic Adapter for Television Equipment", an early color television transmission system. He was only 17. A U.S. patent application (2,296,019) states, "My invention relates to the transmission and reception of colored pictures or images by wire or wireless..." The invention was designed to be easy to adapt to black-and-white television equipment. González Camarena applied for this patent August 14, 1941, and obtained the patent September 15, 1942. He also filed for additional patents for color television systems in 1960 and 1962. He sold his first set in 1954 and sold it for about $1450.
