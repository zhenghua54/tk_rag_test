In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon will write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film would center on the Barbara Gordon version of the character, with The New 52 comics by Gail Simone serving as "a starting point" for the film. In February 2018, it was announced that Whedon would be leaving the project as writer and director, citing that "[he] didn't really have a story". In April 2018, Warner Bros. announced that screenwriter Christina Hodson had been tapped to write the screenplay for Batgirl. The studio is actively looking for a female director.
