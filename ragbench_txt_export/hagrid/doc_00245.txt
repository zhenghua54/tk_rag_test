On 17 June 2016, Bill C-14 to legalize and regulate assisted dying passed in Canada's Parliament. This section outlines the details of this law. Strict rules govern access to assisted suicide. If they are not met, anyone who aids another person in killing themselves is guilty of a crime. Canada's law on assisted dying does not allow advance directives, nor does it allow it for minors or people who are suffering from a mental illness.
