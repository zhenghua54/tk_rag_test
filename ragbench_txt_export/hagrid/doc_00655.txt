G4S has its origins in a guarding business founded in Copenhagen in 1901 by Marius Hogrefe, originally known as "KÃ¸benhavn Frederiksberg Nattevagt" ("Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Night Watch") and subsequently renamed "Falck" ("Falcon"). In 2000, Group 4, a security firm formed in the 1960s, merged with "Falck" to form "Group 4 Falck" and by 2000 the company was described as "the world's largest private security systems company". In 2002 "Group 4 Falck" went on to buy The Wackenhut Corporation in the United States.
