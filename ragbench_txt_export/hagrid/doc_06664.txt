According to the Talmud ("Gittin" 45b), a Torah scroll written by a woman for ritual use is invalid. The Arba'ah Turim, however, does not prohibit women from becoming scribes. Several modern-day rabbis have presented arguments supporting the view that a woman can write a scroll for ritual use. A Conservative Israeli Rabbi, Simcha Roth, wrote that since women may learn the Torah, "they should certainly be eligible to write a scroll". Linda Coppleson, who is a Conservative Jew, expresses that while the Talmud forbids women from writing Torah scrolls, it also states that "whoever is qualified should write a Torah;" and when women have "the same opportunities as men, it is fitting to remove them from forbidden categories". Wendy Graff, the project's leader, said that "if my daughter could read and study the Torah and yet not be allowed to create the scroll that is the basis of our faith, then we still have a long way to go".
