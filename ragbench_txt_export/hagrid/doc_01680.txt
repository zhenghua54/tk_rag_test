Goodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to "square" it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that Archimedes' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of squaring the circle. This is because the problem is to "construct" the area using compass and straightedge only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a "correct" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method:
