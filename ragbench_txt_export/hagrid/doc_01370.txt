Walter Law was born on November 13, 1837 in the English town of Kidderminster. He was one of ten children born to John and Elizabeth Bird Law, who were strict Nonconformists. His father sold carpets and dry goods; at the time, Kidderminster was a center of carpet manufacturing in Britain. Law was educated in private schools in Kidderminster; however, he left school and began working as a cash boy for a draper at the age of fourteen. Shortly after the United Kingdom's election of 1859, the Law family left Kidderminster, many to Australia. That year, Law moved to the United States, having gained an interest in the US after reading about it. He left England with letters of introduction written by his father, which were addressed to friends in the American carpet business; he also had enough money to last for about two weeks. He arrived in New York City on January 22, 1860.
