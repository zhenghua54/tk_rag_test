Lyttelton is the largest settlement on Lyttelton Harbour, an inlet on the northwestern side of Banks Peninsula extending 18Â km inland from the southern end of Pegasus Bay. The town is situated on the lower slopes of the Port Hills, which form the northern side of the harbour and effectively separate Lyttelton from the city of Christchurch. This steep-sided crater rim acts as a natural amphitheatre and a boundary to urban development.
