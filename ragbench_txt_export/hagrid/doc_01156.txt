Due to the bankruptcy of Television South, the series did not continue production past 13 episodes. Following the initial airing of the series throughout 1989, television rights were sold to an unknown party, while all models and sets from the series sold to Britt Allcroft. Modified set props and tugboat models were used in "Thomas & Friends" from 1991 onwards, with footage from the original program being heavily dubbed and edited for use in the American children's series "Salty's Lighthouse".
