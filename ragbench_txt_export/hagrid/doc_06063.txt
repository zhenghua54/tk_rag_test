BFC Germania 1888 continued to play on the local amateur circuit. After World War II occupying Allied authorities banned all organizations in the country including sports and football clubs. The team was re-established in 1946 as "SG Neu-Tempelhof" and appeared fleetingly in the Amateurliga Berlin (III) in 1948â€“49 where they were able only to earn a single point from a draw in 18 matches.
