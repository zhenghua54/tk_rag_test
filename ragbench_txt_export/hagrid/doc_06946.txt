In 1980, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, creators of "What's My Line?", produced "That's My Line" which also highlighted the unusual occupations of ordinary people. However, the show was developed as a reality show and had no panel or game elements. "What's My Line?" announcer Johnny Olson was the announcer, and Bob Barker was the host for the show which ran for two seasons on CBS.
