Since E&B Natural Resources will be using directional drilling for this project, traditional offshore drilling platforms will not be necessary for recovery. The process of Hydraulic Fracturing, or “fracking”, will also not be used, as the oil field provides naturally occurring characteristics that make the fracking unnecessary.
Berkeley Research Group Director William Hamm completed a study that estimated that the City of Hermosa would receive $519 million of total economic benefit from the project, a figure that was quickly criticized by opponents of the project as speculative and unreliable since it is based on a study paid for by E&B.
