Delegate Mizeur has been a high-profile supporter of stronger regulations on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2010, she authored a Baltimore Sun op-ed, "Water on fire," calling attention to the drilling practice. In 2011, she introduced the Marcellus Shale Safe Drilling Act to require strict safety studies on fracking in Maryland. Mizeur's bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. However, Mizeur's bill led to creation of the Marcellus Shale Safe Drilling Initiative under a gubernatorial Executive Order. Mizeur serves on the Initiative's Commission, which is charged with studying the environmental, economic, and health impacts of fracking.
