On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from "The Daily Telegraph" reported that James Stewart had joined the cast of "Home and Away" as Justin Morgan, alongside actors Jackson Heywood and Orpheus Pledger who play his brothers Brody and Mason Morgan respectively. All three began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016. Stewart was contacted by his agent and Julie McGauran, the head of drama at Seven Network, about a role in the show. After hearing the pitch, Stewart accepted the audition. "Home and Away" marks Stewart's second television appearance since he took time away from acting to be a stay-at-home dad. He commented, "I got to the end of three years of raising my daughter and just thought, 'Oh, I need to work. I've got to get her through school.'" New Zealand actor Benedict Wall also auditioned for the role of Justin, before he was later cast as Duncan Stewart. Stewart made his first appearance as Justin on 7 June 2016, alongside Heywood and Pledger.
