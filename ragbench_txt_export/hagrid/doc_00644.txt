The designation "COROT" is a result of its observation by the French-directed Convection, Rotation, and Planetary Transits mission, which was launched late December 2006 with one goal involving the search for exoplanets by measuring the varying brightness of candidate stars when transited by any present exoplanets; CoRoT's second goal pertains to the study of the interiors of stars, which is done by analyzing the characteristics and behavior of light released from the star. The numerical designation was assigned because the first exoplanet discovered by the CoRoT telescope was found in orbit of this star. COROT-1 does not have a common or colloquial name like that of Sirius or Procyon.
