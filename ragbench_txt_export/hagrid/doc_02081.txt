Navy Bill is a sculpture of the United States Naval Academy's mascot, "Bill the Goat", a billy goat. It was designed by Clemente Spampinato in 1956, and presented to the Academy in 1957. Until 2010, the sculpture stood just inside Gate 1 to the Academy. Following a five-year refurbishment underwritten by the Class of 1965, the statue was returned to Gate 1. A second statue commissioned by the Class of 1965 was placed in the north end zone of Navyâ€“Marine Corps Memorial Stadium on 9 June 2015. It was rededicated 24 October 2015. "Navy Bill" has the alternate name of "Goat Mascot".
