On May 15, 1942, Welch went to war. He left behind one son (Claude E. Welch Jr. born June 12, 1939) and a pregnant wife, as well as his job at the MGH. He felt that this was a necessary sacrifice in order to serve his country in its time of need. He departed Boston with 123 other surgeons, physicians, and nurses from the MGH to Camp Blanding, Florida for training. Together they helped to constitute the 6th General Hospital.
