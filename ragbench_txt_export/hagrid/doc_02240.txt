In 1992, GM created a new-generation small-block engine called the "LT1 350", not to be confused with the high-output Generation I LT-1 of the 1970s. It displaced , and was a 2-valve pushrod design. The LT1 used a reverse-flow cooling system which cooled the cylinder heads first, maintaining lower combustion chamber temperatures and allowing the engine to run at a higher compression than its immediate predecessors.
