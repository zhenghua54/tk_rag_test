Discoveries were numerous. Let us cite the first detection of solar-like oscillations in stars other than the Sun, the first detection of non-radial oscillations in red giant stars, the detection of solar-like oscillations in massive stars, the discovery of hundreds of frequencies in Î´ Scuti stars, the spectacular time evolution of the frequency spectrum of a Be (emission lines B) star during an outburst, the first detection of a deviation from a constant period spacing in gravity modes in an SPB (Slowly Pulsating B) star. Interpreting those results opened new horizons in our vision of stars and galaxies. In October 2009 the CoRoT mission was the subject of a special issue of "Astronomy and Astrophysics", dedicated to the early results of the probe. Below are some examples of breakthrough contributions to stellar astrophysics, based on CoRoT's data:
