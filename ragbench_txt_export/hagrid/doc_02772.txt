Hydrocodone/paracetamol, also known as hydrocodone/acetaminophen, is the combination of the pain medications hydrocodone and paracetamol (acetaminophen). It is used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is taken by mouth. Recreational use is common in the United States.
Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, constipation, and vomiting. Serious side effects include addiction, respiratory depression (a decreased effort to breathe), low blood pressure, serotonin syndrome, severe allergic reactions, and liver failure. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Use with alcohol is not recommended. Hydrocodone works by binding to the mu-opioid receptor. How acetaminophen works is unclear.
