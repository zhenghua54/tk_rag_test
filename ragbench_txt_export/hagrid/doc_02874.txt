In December 1801, France despatched the Saint-Domingue expedition to recapture the island, which had been independent since the 1791 Haitian Revolution. This included over 30,000 troops, many experienced and elite veterans but ended in catastrophic failure; by the end of 1802, an estimated 15,000 - 22,000 had died of disease and yellow fever, among them Napoleon's brother-in-law, General Charles Leclerc.
