Within the United States, several of these actors are members of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) or American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA); both merged into the SAG-AFTRA union in October 2012. The merged union has around 165,000 members as of 2016, with about 6,000 members that perform regularly for video games. As early as the 1990s, these unions had developed Interactive Media Agreements with the video game industry to set standard rates for a typical four-hour recording session; around 2005, this was about $759, and around 2013, it was about $800â€“825 per session. These are considered as minimum assured rates, but actors are free to negotiate higher rates with the game's developer or publisher. Alternatively, companies can employ non-union actors.
