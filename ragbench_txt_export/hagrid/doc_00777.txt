The state park was founded in 1922 when the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry established the "Cherry Springs Scenic Drive" on Pennsylvania Route 44. The land where the hotel was and which became Cherry Springs State Park was purchased by the state in 1932. On May 27, 1933, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp S-136-Pa was established at Cherry Springs and built many of the park facilities. CCC Camp S-88-Pa, based at nearby Lyman Run in Potter County, also built some facilities in the park.
