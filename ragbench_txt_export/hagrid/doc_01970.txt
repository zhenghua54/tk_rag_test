"Magadheera"'s success turned Kajal into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema and catapulted her into the foray of leading Telugu actresses. The film was also considered a fate changer in the career of Ram Charan. The role of Sher Khan played by Srihari was considered as one of the best roles in his career and also catapulted S. S. Rajamouli to stardom. Dev Gill attained stardom with this film and went on to work in several South Indian films as an antagonist. After the release of "Magadheera", people began recognising him as Ranadheer. According to writer Gopimohan, "Magadheera" started a trend of experimentation with period, socio-fantasy and spiritual themes that was continued in films like "Panchakshari" (2010), "Nagavalli" (2010), "Anaganaga O Dheerudu" (2011), "Mangala" (2011), "Sri Rama Rajyam" (2011) and "Uu Kodathara? Ulikki Padathara?" (2012).
