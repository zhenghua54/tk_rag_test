In Brazil, when the Vice President dies, resigns or is removed from office, or when a Vice President succeeds to the Presidency, the Vice Presidency remains vacant until the inauguration of the Vice President chosen in the next election. That election is usually the presidential election held in the last year of the presidential term to choose the President and Vice President that will serve in the next four-year presidential term. Only when both the Presidency and the Vice Presidency become vacant at the same time are special elections summoned to elect a new President and Vice President to complete the pending presidential term.
