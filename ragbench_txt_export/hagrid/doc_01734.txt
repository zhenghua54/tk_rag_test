Set in the fictional Hoenn region, the season follows the adventures of the ten-year-old Pokémon trainer Ash Ketchum (voiced in English by Veronica Taylor and in Japanese by Rica Matsumoto) and his electric mouse partner Pikachu (voiced by Ikue Ōtani) as they collect Gym Badges so they can compete in the Hoenn League competition, as well as the Pokémon coordinator May (voiced in English by Taylor and in Japanese by Kaori), who earns Ribbons from Pokémon Contests so she can enter the Hoenn Grand Festival.
