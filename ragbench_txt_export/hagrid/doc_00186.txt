Silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414 °C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40 [[gigapascal]]s known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265 °C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642 °C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.
