The discovery paper, by Queloz "et al.", weighed the planet at about 4.8 Earth masses, giving it a density of 5.6 Â± 1.3 g cm, similar to Earth's. The value was obtained using a pre-whitening procedure and harmonic decomposition. It was also inferred that there was a second non-transiting planet in the system, COROT-7c, with a 3.7-day orbital period.
