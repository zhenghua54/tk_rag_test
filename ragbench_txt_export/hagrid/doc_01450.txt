He worked on the First Transcontinental Railroad as the foreman of a group of Chinese railroad workers, many of whom Chin, himself, recruited and helped to gain passage into the United States. His leadership was important to the construction of the railroad because Chinese railroad workers were used to lay the steel rails. Following the completion of the railroad in 1869 he settled for a time in Black Hawk, Colorado where he was the unofficial leader of a group of Chinese immigrants who settled in a community called Cottonwood.
