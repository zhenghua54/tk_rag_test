The first person to reach all three locations was Edmund Hillary. He reached the top of Everest in May 1953, the South Pole in January 1958 and made it to the North Pole in company with Neil Armstrong in April 1985. Hillary flew to the North Pole. The first person to reach all three locations on foot was Erling Kagge. He had reached all three by May 1994, being 6 months faster than the next person. On 5 August 1997 Antoine de Choudens (France, 1969–2009) became the only climber to accomplish the Three Poles Challenge on foot without using supplementary oxygen on the Everest climb. Tina Sjögren became the first woman to complete the challenge in 2002.
