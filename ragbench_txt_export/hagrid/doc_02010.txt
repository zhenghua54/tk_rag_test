On a map made by De Witt in 1790 the name of Arbor Hill makes its first appearance on a map of Albany. In this map Arbor Hill is located in Sheridan Hollow between Orange Street and Clinton Avenue (south and north) and from Chapel Street halfway to Hawk Street (east to west); later Arbor Hill would be the name given to the Ten Broeck Mansion and surrounding neighborhood on the other side of Clinton Avenue, the former village of Colonie. On this same map a "Negro burial ground" is shown along the southern rim of the Hollow, this burial ground does not show up on any subsequent maps and it may never have been plotted and used.
