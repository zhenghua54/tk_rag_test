Another visited site by tourists and local North Shore residents is the Salton Sea. What makes the Salton Sea a remarkable attraction is mostly due to the fact that (1) it is the largest California lake and (2) because it is located in the San Andreas Fault. This site attracts mostly geologists or environmentalists that seek research and other studies about the geology or pollution of the lake.
