Under the terms of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, the West Virginia Legislature created the
Agricultural College of West Virginia on February 7, 1867, and the school officially opened on September 2 of the same year.
On December 4, 1868, lawmakers renamed the college West Virginia
University to represent a broader range of higher education. The University was built on the grounds of three former academies, namely the
Monongalia Academy of 1814, the Morgantown Female Academy of 1831,
and Woodburn Female Seminary of 1858. Upon its founding, the local newspaper claimed
that "a place more eligible for the quiet and successful pursuit of science and literature
is nowhere to be found."
