Eric Northman is a fictional character in "The Southern Vampire Mysteries," a series of thirteen books written by "New York Times" bestselling author Charlaine Harris. He is a vampire, slightly over one thousand years old, and is first introduced in the first novel, "Dead Until Dark" and appears in all subsequent novels. Since the book series is told from the first person perspective of Sookie Stackhouse, what readers perceive of his character is influenced by what Sookie comprehends. HBO's television series "True Blood" is based on this book series and the character of Eric Northman is portrayed somewhat differently. A list of "True Blood" characters has a detailed description of Eric's character from the TV show.
