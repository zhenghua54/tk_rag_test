Marvel initially produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, a backup story in the series "Howard the Duck", and a one-shot "Gwenpool Holiday Special". A retcon in the "Howard the Duck" #1 backup revealed her name to actually be "Gwen Poole." Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled "The Unbelievable Gwenpool" by the same creative team was announced, which started in April 2016. "The Unbelievable Gwenpool" #0, collecting Poole's appearances from "Howard the Duck" and the first "Gwenpool Holiday Special", was later released.
