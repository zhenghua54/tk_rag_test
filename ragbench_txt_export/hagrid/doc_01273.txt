Jor-El hires Lex Luthor to work at JorCorp, but Luthor eventually attempts a complex plan to destroy Jor-El's reputation with the aid of his reprogrammed A.I. B, feeling that Jor-El is nothing more than a megalomaniac with a superbrain and a god complex who would always undermine his accomplishments. After Luthor's plan turns Bru-El against his family as a kryptonite-powered superhuman, Bru-El nearly kills his father before Lara sacrifices herself to save her husband, Kal-El managing to defeat his brother after he expends so much of his kryptonite energy in the early attack. Recognising the flaws in his past actions, Jor-El steps back from the public eye, becoming a simple wanderer of Earth and other planets, while allowing Kal-El to act as the official hero as Superman.
