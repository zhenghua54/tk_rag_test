Isotretinoin is a teratogen; there is about a 20–35% risk for congenital defects in infants exposed to the drug "in utero", and about 30–60% of children exposed to isotretinoin prenatally have been reported to show neurocognitive impairment. Because of this, there are strict controls on prescribing isotretinoin to women who may become pregnant and women who become pregnant while taking isotretinoin are strongly advised to terminate their pregnancies.
