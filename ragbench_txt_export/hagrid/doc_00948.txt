The Marquis was again offered in a standard trim, Marquis Brougham, and the Mercury Grand Marquis made its return. In Canada, a base-level Marquis Meteor trim was offered through 1981. A two-door sedan and four-door sedan was offered, alongside two Marquis station wagons: a body-color Marquis wagon and a woodgrain trim Mercury Colony Park wagon.
