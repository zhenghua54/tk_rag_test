The series stars Julia Ormond as lead character Joanna Beauchamp, a witch and mother of Freya Beauchamp (Jenna Dewan) and Ingrid Beauchamp (Rachel Boston), who are part of the next generation of witches. MÃ¤dchen Amick co-stars as Joanna's mischievous witch sister Wendy Beauchamp. The series is loosely based on the book's plot, with one change being that Freya and Ingrid are initially unaware of their magical powers.Notes:
