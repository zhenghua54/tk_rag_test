As a houseplant, the Silver Torch cactus is an easy to take care of so long as over-watering is avoided. To naturally simulate the porous effects of the sand in its native habitat, it's important to ensure that excess water will not pool in the soil, causing the roots to become water logged. This plantâ€™s native habitat does not have winter, but when temperatures drop to the low twenties, it can exhibit signs of tip frost.  The Silver Torch cactus is most susceptible to  mealybugs  and spider mite.
