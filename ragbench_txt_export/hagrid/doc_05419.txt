Hunter's presence later caused Zac and Leah's relationship to become strained. Hunter made it clear to Leah that he wanted Zac to himself and when she voiced her concerns about him, Zac refused to believe his son was up to no good. When Hunter pretended to drown during a trip to the beach, his actions caused Zac to stand Leah up. Nicodemou told an "Inside Soap" columnist, "After Leah hears that Hunter didn't want to go to hospital, she thinks it was just a plot to get his mum and dad back together." Zac was upset when Leah accused Hunter, as he believed she should trust him. Realising that there would be a time where Zac would have to choose between her and Hunter, Leah decided to make the decision for him and ended their engagement.
