While the actions of the Armée Indigène were fueled by Enlightenment principles that advocated for the equality of all Frenchmen, the Haitian Revolution had many casualties; both sides suffered losses from their own violence. The Haitians suffered about 200,000 casualties, which made them the group that lost the most. The British and French together suffered about 120,000 casualties. Dessalines would later be known for the 1804 massacre of the French, which lasted for 2 months and even affected innocents like women and children.
