COROT-7b was found by observing its parent star's periodic decrease in apparent magnitude caused by the planet's transit in front of the star as seen from Earth. Measuring this dip in brightness, together with a size estimate for the star, allows one to calculate the planet's size. (See Transit method.) The space mission COROT observed the star COROT-7, in the stellar field LRa01, from 15 October 2007 to 3 March 2008. During this period, 153 periodic transit signals of 1.3 h duration with a depth of 3.4 Ã— 10 were registered. After 40 days of data acquisition, the Alarm mode pipeline algorithm detected the shallow signal of COROT-7b, starting the follow-up observations from the ground to get a confirmation of the planetary nature of the transiting object.
