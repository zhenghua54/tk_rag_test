Jenkinson went on to record a few more releases under his own name, including the "Crot E.P." and "Bubble And Squeak E.P.", as well as a split with Dunderhead, called "Dragon Disc 2". In 1995, Tom began releasing music under the name Squarepusher, first appearing with the "", then following with "Alroy Road Tracks" under the name Duke Of Harringay, both on Finn's Spymania label. By 1996, Squarepusher had line up material for release at Rephlex Records, which was operated by Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James, a.k.a. Aphex Twin. Squarepusher released the "Squarepusher Plays..." 12" for Rephlex, followed by his debut album, "Feed Me Weird Things" (Jenkinson later released an album and E.P. under the name Chaos A.D. for Rephlex in 1998).
