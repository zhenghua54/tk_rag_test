In 2007, Amerigroup developed the National Advisory Board (NAB) to focus on meeting the needs of seniors and people with disabilities, who are a significant proportion of its clients. The NAB provides policy recommendations for improving programs and services for seniors and people with disabilities. Convened by Lex Frieden, who was instrumental in conceiving and drafting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the NAB is made up of 19 community advocates, health care experts and academics. The NAB advocated that the modernized health care infrastructure be required to meet the needs of people with disabilities and seniors.
