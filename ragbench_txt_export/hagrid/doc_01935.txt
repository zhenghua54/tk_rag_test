Cromwell was condemned to death without trial, lost all his titles and property and was beheaded on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540 in a public execution, the day of the King's marriage to Catherine Howard. The executioner had great difficulty severing the head. Cromwell made a prayer and speech on the scaffold, professing to die, "in the traditional faith" [Catholic] and denying that he had aided heretics. Edward Hall, a contemporary chronicler, records that Cromwell then "so patiently suffered the stroke of the axe, by a ragged and Boocherly [butcher-like] miser, whiche very ungoodly perfourmed the Office". Afterwards, his head was set on a spike on London Bridge.
