Patrick Troughton was a familiar face on BBC TV from playing the Second Doctor in "Doctor Who"; a contemporary "Blue Peter" feature on the drama makes the connection that in the role of Cole Hawlings, the kindly Punch and Judy Man, Troughton was playing another mysterious, scruffy time traveller. Renny Rye noted that Troughton "who was my favourite Doctor Who...had a quality that is unsurpassed, I think, as someone to pull you into a tale."
