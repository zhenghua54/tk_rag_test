"Tugs" first aired on CITV in the United Kingdom, and then on Australia's ABC TV. Talks of a second series were never finalised, and eventually all plans to create a follow-up were dropped. Redubbed and heavily edited footage aired later as part of American children's series "Salty's Lighthouse", which aired in 1997.
