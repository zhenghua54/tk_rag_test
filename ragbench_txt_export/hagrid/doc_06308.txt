The game was originally described as a main entry in the "Tales" series. After the game's release, with the announcement of "Tales of Innocence" in July 2007, the series was divided between mainline "Mothership" titles and spin-off "Escort" titles. "Tempest", described by Yoshizumi in 2007 as a precursor to "Innocence", was officially reclassified as an Escort title at this point. It was speculated by "Game Informer" that the game's lack of critical and fan acclaim that caused the change, but this has not been confirmed. The game has yet to receive a western localization. Later, staff members of "Innocence" stated that "Tempest" was seen as a spin-off while still in development. After the release of the Vita port of "Innocence", "Innocence R", artwork found in that game caused speculation that "Tempest" might be remade. The "Triverse" connection between the three developed DS titles was established by Bandai Namdo producer Takashi Yota: first featuring in "Innocence R", they were included in "Tales of Hearts R" after positive fan feedback. In 2014, it was revealed that Bandai Namco had been considering a remake of "Tempest" for some time, and that there was demand for both a remake by Japanese fans and a western release. So far, nothing has been announced.
