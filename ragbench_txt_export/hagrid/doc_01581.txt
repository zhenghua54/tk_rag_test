Since the loss of Khâm Đức to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) during the Battle of Kham Duc from 10-12 May 1968, the PAVN had used the area as a base for operations in Quảng Tín Province. It was decided that US forces should sweep the area to disrupt the PAVN logistics buildup and forestall a PAVN offensive in the autumn and winter.
