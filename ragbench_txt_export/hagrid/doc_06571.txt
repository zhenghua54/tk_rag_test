Since joining the Patriots broadcast, Socci and Zolak have called three Super Bowl Championships. In February 2015 the Patriots won the franchises fourth Super Bowl defeating the Seattle Seahawks when rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass at the goal line sealing the title. In February 2017 the duo called "The Greatest Comeback in Super Bowl History" when the Patriots rallied from a 28-3 third quarter deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in the first overtime game in 51 years of the Super Bowl.
