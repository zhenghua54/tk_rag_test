Among film critics, "House of 1000 Corpses" received a generally negative reaction following its release. The film was critically panned, with the film's various side-plots and main cast being criticized by multiple critics. The film earned over $3 million in its opening weekend, and would later go on to gross over $16 million worldwide. Despite its initial negative reception, the film went on to develop a cult following. Zombie later developed a haunted house attraction for Universal Studios Hollywood based on the film. Zombie later directed the film's sequel, "The Devil's Rejects" (2005), in which the Firefly family are on the run from the police. Additionally, Zombie is also set to be directing "3 from Hell", the sequel to "The Devil's Rejects". This would be the final film performance of Dennis Fimple before his death in August 2002. This film was dedicated to his memory.
