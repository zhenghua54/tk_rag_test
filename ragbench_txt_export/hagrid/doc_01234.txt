Broadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently from in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of 'the "Super Sentai" brand originating in Japan. "Power Rangers" was briefly banned in Malaysia for supposedly encouraging the use of drugs because it contained the word "Morphin'" in its title, which could be associated with morphine. The show eventually aired without the offending word. In Japan, many "Power Rangers" television seasons and movies were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past "Super Sentai" casts, leading to the English-dubbed action sequences being "re-dubbed" or "restored" back to Japanese as well. "Power Rangers Mystic Force" is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in January 2014, with the "Magiranger" cast voicing their counterparts. After broadcast of "Power Rangers" ended in South Korea with "Wild Force", Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed "Super Sentai" series under the "파워레인저" "(Power Ranger)" brand on JEI TV. Some seasons of "Super Sentai" broadcast in South Korea have similarly named titles as their American counterparts, such as "Power Ranger Dino Thunder" for "Abaranger" in 2007 and "Power Ranger S.P.D." in place of "Dekaranger".
