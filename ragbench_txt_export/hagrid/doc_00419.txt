Verbal contracts are binding. They must be made in an official capacity, however, to be binding. "Dezick v. Umpqua Community College" (1979) found a student was compensated because classes offered orally by the dean were not provided. "Healy v. Larsson" (1974) found that a student who completed degree requirements prescribed by an academic advisor was entitled to a degree on the basis that this was an implied contract. An advisor should, thus, be considered an official source of information. "Mississippi Medical Center v. Hughes" (2000) determined that students have an implied right to a continuous contract during a period of continuous enrollment suggesting that students have the right to graduate so long as they fulfill the requirements as they were originally communicated. Degree requirement changes are unacceptable. "Bruner v. Petersen" (1997) found also that contractual protections do not apply in the event that a student, who has failed to meet requirements, is readmitted into a program. The student may be required to meet additional requirements which support their success. This may also help avoid issues of discrimination. "Brody v. Finch University of Health Sciences Chicago Med. School" (1998) determined that students have the right to notice of degree requirement changes (Kaplan & Lee, 2011). If a student, for instance, is absent for a semester and is not continuously enrolled they need to know if degree requirements have changed. Decision making should not be arbitrary or capricious / random and, thus, interfere with fairness. This is a form of discrimination. While this case concerned a private school, "Healy v. Larsson" (1974) found that what applied to private intuitions applied also to public.
