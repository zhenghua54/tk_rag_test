Although the 1954 Aboriginal Peopleâ€™s Act (formerly the Aboriginal Peoples Ordinance) allows political authorities to gazette certain plots of land as protected aboriginal reserves, the Orang Asli are not regarded as the legal owners of these reserves. Furthermore, under Section 6 of the Act, the State is vested with powers to change the status of these formerly gazetted areas, thereby removing any long-standing legal protection. Inhabited Orang Asli lands which are not gazetted are even less protected.
