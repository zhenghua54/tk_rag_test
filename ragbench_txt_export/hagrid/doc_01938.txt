First launched in the 2006 model year, the Cayman is a coupé derived from Porsche's second and third generation Boxster roadster, styled in its first iteration by Pinky Lai. A large percentage of the Boxsters were assembled in Finland for Porsche by Valmet Automotive with others assembled in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart. All Caymans were manufactured in Finland by Valmet Automotive. Porsche's Deputy Chairman, Holger P. Haerter said the contract with Valmet Automotive would end in 2012, and the Cayman's production was to be outsourced to Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria. As Volkswagen assumed control of Porsche AG, production of Caymans and Boxsters after 2012 began in the former Karmann plant in Osnabrück, Germany, at the time owned by Volkswagen and also used for production of the 2012 Golf (Mk6) convertible.
