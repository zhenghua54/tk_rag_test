Symptoms include:
Onset within the first few days of amputation.
Comes and goes or is continuous.
Often affects the part of the limb farthest from the body, such as the foot of an amputated leg
May be described as shooting, stabbing, boring, squeezing, throbbing or burning
Sometimes feels as if the phantom part is forced into an uncomfortable position
May be triggered by pressure on the remaining part of the limb or emotional stress
Phantom limb pain and phantom limb sensations are linked, but must be differentiated from one another. While phantom limb sensations are experienced by those with congenital limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, and amputation, phantom limb pain occurs almost exclusively as a result of amputation. Almost immediately following the amputation of a limb, 90â€“98% of patients report experiencing a phantom sensation. Nearly 75% of individuals experience the phantom as soon as anesthesia wears off, and the remaining 25% of patients experience phantoms within a few days or weeks. Of those experiencing innocuous sensations, a majority of patients also report distinct painful sensations.
