Barcelona's involvement in motorsport included the street circuit at Montju√Øc, used for the both Formula One and MotoGP from 1950 to 1976, and the Circuit de Catalunya, completed in 1991. The former street circuit had one Olympic venue inside its circuit and two others located south and adjacent to it. Circuit de Catalunya would serve as the start and finish line area for the cycling road team time trial event. The marathon course was a relatively flat one until the final where it was an uphill climb to the Olympic Stadium. Complaints about garbage in the water near the sailing venue forced the Barcelona Port Authority to have four garbage vessels pick up the garbage on a daily basis.
