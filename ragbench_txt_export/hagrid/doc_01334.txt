Molecular masses are calculated from the standard atomic weights of each nuclide, while molar masses are calculated from the atomic mass of each element. The atomic mass takes into account the isotopic distribution of the element in a given sample (usually assumed to be "normal"). For example, water has a molar mass of 18.0153(3) g/mol, but individual water molecules have molecular masses which range between 18.010 564 6863(15) u (HO) and 22.027 7364(9) u (DO).
