Louis-Dreyfus subsequently became a cast member on "Saturday Night Live" from 1982 to 1985, the youngest female cast member in the history of the program at that time. During her time on "SNL", she appeared alongside several actors who would later rise to prominence, such as Eddie Murphy, Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, and Martin Short. It was during her third and final year on "SNL" that she met writer Larry David during his only year on the show, who would later co-create "Seinfeld". Louis-Dreyfus has commented that her casting on "SNL" was a "Cinderella-getting-to-go-to-the-ball kind of experience"; however, she has also admitted that at times it was often quite tense, stating that she "didn't know how to navigate the waters of show business in general and specifically doing a live sketch-comedy show".
