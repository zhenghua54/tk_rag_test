Unlike "Crash Tag Team Racing", Radical did not hire the composer of the music in the previous "Crash" games, the a cappella band Spiralmouth whose members Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann left to compose musical pieces to "" and "" from Crash's companion franchise "Spyro the Dragon", to write the music for "Crash of the Titans". Instead, they assigned the job to their in-house composer Marc Baril, who took Spiralmouth's work on the previous games as references for "Crash of the Titans". Radical Entertainment has expressed its pride with some of the music featured in the game, such as Doctor N. Gin's polka theme. A 32-track soundtrack was made available on the iTunes Music Store on December 18, 2007. The music in the Nintendo DS version of the game was created by Nathaniel Papadakis.
