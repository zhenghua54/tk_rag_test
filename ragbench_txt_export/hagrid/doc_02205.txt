Justin Morgan, played by James Stewart, made his first screen appearance on 7 June 2016. The character and Stewart's casting was announced on 5 December 2015, alongside Jackson Heywood and Orpheus Pledger, who play Justin's brothers. The actors began filming their first scenes during the week commencing 7 December. Justin is Stewart's first on-going role since he took a year off to care for his young daughter. Like Heywood, Stewart expected Braxton brothers comparisons, but he told Jonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph, "Creating this family is probably more our priority than taking over the Brax boys. How do you take on Steve Peacocke (Brax)? I hope Australia is ready for it, it is the way it is." In August 2017, Stewart was longlisted for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. The nomination did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.
