The reality of "Homicide"'s low Nielsen ratings hovered over all things, however, and always left the show in a precarious position; it also had a harder time gaining a large audience because fewer viewers are at home watching TV on Friday nights. Despite this, the network managed to keep what "TV Guide" referred to as "The Best Show You're Not Watching" on the air for five full seasons and seven seasons in all. In July 1997, NBC gave the series producers an ultimatum to make "Homicide" more popular than "Nash Bridges" or face cancellation. When this goal was not reached, the studio gave serious consideration to canceling the show, but a number of shocks at NBC increased "Homicide"'s value. Among those factors were the loss of the popular series "Seinfeld" and the $850Â million deal needed to keep "ER" from leaving the network.
