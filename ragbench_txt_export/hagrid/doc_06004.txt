Kef Toghobeit is a karst cave near the settlement of Bab Taza in Chefchaouen Province, Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima, in northern Morocco. Currently known to be long and deep, it is the deepest cave in Morocco, and the third deepest cave in Africa.
Although Kef Toghobeit has been well-explored, its full extent is not yet known. Indeed, the karst topography of the Rif mountain range where the cave begins has barely been mapped - just 1000 caves are known in Morocco, and the geology would suggest that more than this exist.
