The system of reserves and stations was ended by the "Aborigines Welfare Act 1969". The Aboriginal Lands Trust was established by the "Aborigines (Amendment) Act, 1973". The Trust assumed the corporate ownership of all Aboriginal reserves throughout New South Wales on behalf of, and for the benefit of Aboriginal people. Freehold title to the remaining reserves was transferred to the Trust, to maintain, develop or dispose of these reserves in the manner which would best serve the needs of the Aboriginal community. The Trust was also responsible for houses located on the reserves. The Aboriginal Lands Trust was abolished by the "Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1983". The property was transferred to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and from there to Aboriginal Land Councils.
