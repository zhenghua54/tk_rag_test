Vox's Framke felt that the video referenced Beyoncé's visual album "Lemonade" (2016) multiple times. Framke found the monologue in the video similar to Beyoncé's "Pray You Catch Me" (2016), while the rainbow outfit that Kesha wore reminded her of the yellow dress that Beyoncé sported in her "Hold Up" video, which was also directed by Åkerlund. The author further wrote that "evoking Beyoncé's imagery at the video's onset dilutes the message, making it feel more like an homage than the emotional purge [Kesha] says it is." Similarly, "The Stranger"s Amber Cortes criticized Kesha for taking influence from Beyoncé's work in the "Praying" clip, writing that it emulated the "watery imagery" of the video for "Hold Up". William Ferrer of "The Seattle Times" also found the visual similar to "Lemonade", but added "there's something haunting about 'Praying' that sets it apart from "Lemonade". [It] feels more ethereal, more eerily uncertain than Beyonce's self-assured tour de force. And [...] 'Praying' is better for it."
