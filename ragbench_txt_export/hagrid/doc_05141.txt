At the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include ""X-Men"" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in "Dark Phoenix" which was compared to the "X-Files" logo; the film was later confirmed to be simply titled "Dark Phoenix" in the United States, and "X-Men: Dark Phoenix" for release internationally. By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members. The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand√© studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period, and had begun by August 31. At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that were previously reserved for Fox's newly-delayed "Gambit".
