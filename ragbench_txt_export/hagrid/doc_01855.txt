Teaming up with producer Steven Spielberg, Bluth's next project was "An American Tail" (1986), which at the time of its release became the highest grossing non-Disney animated film of all time, grossing $45 million in the United States and over $84 million worldwide. The second Spielberg-Bluth collaboration "The Land Before Time" (1988) did even better in theaters and both found a successful life on home video. The main character in "An American Tail" (Fievel Mouskewitz) became the mascot for Amblimation while "The Land Before Time" was followed by thirteen direct-to-video sequels.
