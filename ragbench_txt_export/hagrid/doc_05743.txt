Seven Buddhist caves, older than Kanheri Caves have also been discovered very recently. Detailed exploration and documentation is awaited from The Archaeological Survey of India. The park's main entrance is located in Borivali, east of Borivali railway station, which is approximately north of southern tip of Mumbai city, with suburban trains running every 5 minutes. From Borivali station, one can walk or hire an auto rickshaw to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It is well connected with all parts of Mumbai and Maharashtra by road. The Western Express Highway (NH 8) passes by the park entrance. Buses are available on holidays and Sundays from Mumbai to the park. Also, chartered vehicles can be hired for groups to visit the park.
