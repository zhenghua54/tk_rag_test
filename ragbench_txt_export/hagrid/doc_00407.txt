Australia registered the Anatolian Shepherd Dog breed in 1985 when it was imported as a guard dog for livestock, people and property. Australia’s expansive sheep and goat enterprises contributed to the breed’s acceptance as a livestock guardian dog beyond Turkey, and developed the sheep and goat guard dog of the Turkish Shepherd into an imposing guard dog of livestock and farm assets for Agriultural and Farming Industry. The working conditions and requirements of the dogs in Australia and the assets of Australian farmers, are very different to the generally impoverished Shepherd in Turkey and his herd of goats and sheep. Australian farmland is fenced, and the dogs are required to protect valuable assets against four and two legged threats.  “Anatolian Karabash Guard Dogs.
