Transmorphers is a science fiction alien invasion film released direct-to-DVD on June 26, 2007. It was written and directed by Leigh Scott and produced by David Michael Latt and The Asylum, "a studio whose work gets slightly more respect than the Girls Gone Wild series, and slightly less than backyard-wrestling DVDs", according to Keith Phipps of AVClub. "Transmorphers" was developed as a mockbuster, intending to capitalize on Michael Bay's "Transformers". The film was followed by a 2009 prequel titled "".
