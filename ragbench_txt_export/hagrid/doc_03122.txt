Acceleration from a standstill to takes 5.1 seconds for the saloon with manual gearbox, the Avant one tenth of a second slower at 5.2 seconds. The same dash to 100 km/h in the saloon with S tronic takes 5.3 seconds, and the Avant at 5.4 seconds. The top speed is electronically limited to . However, a comparison in the American automotive magazine "Road & Track" showed the sprint from 0 to 60 mph in only 4.5 seconds for the 6-speed manual transmission. With figures like these, the B8 S4 accelerates more quickly than its V8-engined predecessors. Audi of America claims that the version of the S4 achieves 28 highway miles per gallon, and a 0 to acceleration time of 4.9 seconds with the manual transmission and 5.1 seconds with the S tronic. Fuel consumption is rated at a combined . Therefore, the B8 S4, unlike the V8-powered B6/7 models, avoids the US gas guzzler tax. The B8 S4's 3.0 TFSI engine also gets only 1 m.p.g. less than the base 2.0 TFSI engine. This is one of the most important reasons for Audi to downsize their engines, while keeping the output equivalent better, by using forced-induction such as supercharging or turbocharging.
