Some objected to this usage as the new Queen was in fact only the first Elizabeth to reign over the United Kingdom or indeed Great Britain, Elizabeth I having been solely the Queen of England. In 1953, John MacCormick took legal action against the Lord Advocate in the case of "MacCormick v Lord Advocate" challenging the right of the Queen to call herself Elizabeth the Second. The case failed on the grounds that the matter was within the Royal Prerogative and thus the Queen was free to adopt any title she saw fit. However, a submission by the Crown stated that the Royal title was decided to reflect the highest number from either the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland and while Elizabeth II was not the second Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, she was the second Elizabeth in the territory which now made up the United Kingdom.
