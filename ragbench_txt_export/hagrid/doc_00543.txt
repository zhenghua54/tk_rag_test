Cloud Strife appears in "Kingdom Hearts" at Olympus Coliseum, based on Disney's "Hercules". In the game, he is a mercenary hired by Hades to kill Hercules in exchange for the whereabouts of Sephiroth, who is an optional boss included in the North American, PAL, and "Final Mix" releases of the game. Cloud and Tifa Lockhart later appear in "Kingdom Hearts II" as allies of the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee; Sephiroth also returns here as an optional boss, and is depicted as the embodiment of Cloud's darkness.
