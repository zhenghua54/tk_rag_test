In the year 628, at an age of 30, he composed the "Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta" (the improved treatise of Brahma) which is believed to be a revised version of the received "siddhanta" of the Brahmapaksha school. Scholars state that he incorporated a great deal of originality to his revision, adding a considerable amount of new material. The book consists of 24 chapters with 1008 verses in the ārya metre. A good deal of it is astronomy, but it also contains key chapters on mathematics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry and algorithmics, which are believed to contain new insights due to Brahmagupta himself.
