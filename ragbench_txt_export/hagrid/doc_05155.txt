Yusef married Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) in an arranged marriage in Pakistan at the age of 17. Zainab brought shame upon their respective families when she had an affair with Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra). As punishment, Yusef set Zainab on fire, though he claimed it to be his family's doing and that he tried to save her. Masood rescued Zainab and she divorced Yusef to marry Masood, moving with him to the UK. Yusef later remarried and had a daughter, Afia (Meryl Fernandes).
