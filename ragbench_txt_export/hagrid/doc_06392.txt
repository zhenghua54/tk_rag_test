The Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County (MAWC), the local water utility, leased the watershed in 1999 for gas drilling, and about 100 shallow gas wells have been drilled since then.
And in 2008, deeper drilling and fracking for gas in the Marcellus shale began near the reservoir.
As of 2013, 41 deep wells have been drilled on 6 pads. The drillers are Consol Energy's CNX Gas.
Some of the chemicals used by Consol for fracking have been listed online by the MAWC.
There is no information on the location, date, or total quantities of chemicals used, but Material Safety Data Sheets discuss the hazards and properties of these chemicals and others:
