The two most important locations of the story are Bath and Whitby. Bath is described as a rather peaceful and idyllic place for wealthy people. Conversely, Whitby, fishing port and famous tourist destination, represents the rough life on the Yorkshire coast. And the landfall for Count Alucard's undead cargo, according to Bram Stoker. Since this was the home town of "England's first poet" CÃ¦dmon, who is the eponym for the book, Whitby plays an important role within the story. Other towns and villages on the north-east coast of England like Staithes, Robin Hood's Bay and Scarborough are mentioned when Kirsten visits them to look for her attacker. Another place mentioned in the text is Brierley Coombe, the fictitious home town of Kirsten. Brierley Coombe is assumed to be a suburb of Bath, therefore it has similar features.
