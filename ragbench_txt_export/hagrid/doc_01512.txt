Madelyne "Maddie" Jennifer Pryor-Summers is a fictional supervillainess appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, primarily featured off-and-on as an antagonist of the X-Men. Originally the love interest and first wife of X-Men leader Cyclops (Scott Summers), she became a long-standing member of the "X-Men" supporting cast, until a series of traumas—being abandoned by her husband, losing her infant son, and discovering that she was a clone of Jean Grey—eventually led to her being manipulated into becoming a supervillain. She and Cyclops are the parents of Nathan Summers (Cable). Her biography has been rendered particularly complicated because of the many retcons involved in the publication history of both her character and that of Jean Grey.
