Nakiri bōchō (, translation: knife for cutting greens) and usuba bōchō (, thin knife) are Japanese-style vegetable knives. They differ from the "deba bōchō" in their shape, as they have a straight blade edge suitable for cutting all the way to the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push. These knives are also much thinner. While the "deba bōchō" is a heavy blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice. The "nakiri bōchō" and the "usuba bōchō" have a much thinner blade. This does not help with cutting small bones in fish or meat, but is useful for cutting vegetables.
