The COROT team then published a second paper on COROT-7b's mass, removing stellar activity through analysis only of radial velocity data for which multiple measurements were taken in a given night. The planet is weighed at 7.42 Earth masses, yielding an average density of 10.4 Â± 1.8 g cm, far higher than the Earth's and similar to that of the second rocky planet found, Kepler-10b.
