Cybertron is a fictional planet, the homeworld of the Transformers in the various fictional incarnations of the metaseries and toyline by Hasbro. In the Japanese series, the planet is referred to as "Cybertron" (first shown on Japanese "Galaxy Force" packaging, despite the fact that "Cybertron" is the Japanese name for "Autobot") pronounced as セイバートロン "Seibātoron". Cybertron is populated by mechanical life forms of variable size who can transform into all kinds of machinery. These are called Cybertronians, or Transformers.
