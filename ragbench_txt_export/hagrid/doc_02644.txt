In general, only the assignments of the basic 26 letters of the French alphabet are retained in other braille alphabets. For example, among the additional letters, in German Braille only "ü" and "ö" coincide with French Braille. However, there are several alphabets which are much more closely related. Italian Braille is identical to the French apart from doubling up French Braille "ò" to Italian "ó" and "ò", since French has no "ó". Indeed, a principal difference of these alphabets is the remapping of French vowels with a grave accent ("à è ì ò ù") to an acute accent ("á é í ó ú"), as the French alphabet does not support acute accents apart from "é". Spanish changes all five of these vowels, as well as taking "ü". Portuguese Braille is also very similar to the French, though the shift of grave to acute accents necessitated a chain of other changes, such as circumflex to grave, and the Portuguese tildes were taken from French diaereses (Portuguese "ã õ" for French "ä ö/œ"). The continental Scandinavian languages took the extended French letters "â" (for "å"), "ä/æ", and "ö/ø". Vietnamese Braille is also quite similar, though it has added tone letters, and according uses French "z" for "d", which is pronounced like "z".
