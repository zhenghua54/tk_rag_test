Disney had provided the voice for Mickey Mouse since his debut in 1928, and "Fun and Fancy Free" was the last time he would voice the role regularly, as he no longer had the time or energy to do so. Disney recorded most of Mickey's dialogue in the spring and summer of 1941. Sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald would become the character's new voice actor, starting in 1948. Disney, however, did reprise the role for the introduction to the original 1955â€“59 run of "The Mickey Mouse Club".
