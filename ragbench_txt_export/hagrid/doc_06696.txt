"Spider-Verse" is a 2014 comic book storyline published by Marvel Comics. It features multiple alternative versions of Spider-Man that had appeared in various media, all under attack by Morlun and his family, the Inheritors. The last two episodes of "Spider-Man: The Animated Series (Spider-Wars)" about multiple Spider-Men going across dimensions fighting villains, served as inspiration for Spider-Verse. Beginning in August 2014, the event was preceded by two new issues of the cancelled "Superior Spider-Man", issues of "Spider-Man 2099" and a five issue run of one shots-all under the "Edge of Spider-Verse" banner.
