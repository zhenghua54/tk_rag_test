Although the concept of fallen angels developed from early Judaism during the Second Temple period, rabbis from the second century onward turned against the Enochian writings, probably in order to prevent fellow Jews from worship and veneration of angels. Thus, while many angels were individualized and sometimes venerated during the Second Temple period, the status of angels was degraded to a class of creatures, thereby emphasizing the omnipresence of God. The 2nd-century rabbi Simeon b. Yohai cursed everyone who explained the term "Sons of God" as angels. He stated, "Sons of God" were actually "sons of judges" or "sons of nobles". Evil was no longer attributed to heavenly forces, now it was dealt as an "evil inclination" ("yetzer hara") within humans. However, narrations of fallen angels do appear in later rabbinic writings. In some midrashim, the "evil inclination" is attributed to Samael, who is in charge of several "satans". But these angels are still subordinative to God. The reacceptance of fallen angels in midrashic discourse was probably influenced by the role of fallen angels in Islamic lore.
