Superman: The Last Family of Krypton is a comic book limited series, published in 2010. It depicts what could have happened if Superman's parents also arrived on Earth. Jor-El was able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement 'Raology'. Lara is willing to adapt to life on Earth, arranging for Kal-El to be discreetly adopted by the Kents so that he can live a more normal life, and later has twin children, Bru-El and Valora, whose 'stunted' genetics due to their birth on Earth mean that they only possess half of the superhuman potential of their brother. BY contrast, Jor-El is particularly focused on scientific development above all else, even spending a large portion of his time in a chair that downloads information about Earth directly into his brain so that he can keep track of Earth's development in order to cut off any attempt to prevent a similar disaster befalling Earth as happened on Krypton. Although his actions hinder Earth by keeping humanity essentially dependent on him, Jor-El argues that Earth only needs his family to protect them, such as telling the Guardians of the Universe not to bother appointing a Green Lantern to Earth. While attending a dinner in Gotham, Lara is able to save Thomas and Martha Wayne when she intercepts Joe Chill's attempted mugging, thus unknowingly preventing the creation of Batman. Lara eventually rejects Jor-El's desire to 'micromanage' humanity, relocating to her own estate of 'Lara-Land', where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using Kryptonian technology to heal injuries.
