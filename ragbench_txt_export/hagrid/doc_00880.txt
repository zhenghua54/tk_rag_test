Incorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists. One of the professional titles for engineers in the United Kingdom, recognized in the Washington Accord is the chartered engineer. The incorporated engineer is a professional engineer as declared by the Engineering Council of the United Kingdom, and the European definition as demonstrated by the prescribed title under 2005/36/EC as an "engineer". The incorporated engineer operates autonomously and directs activities independently. They do not necessarily need the support of chartered engineers because they are often acknowledged as full engineers in the U.K. (but not in Canada or the U.S.). The United Kingdom incorporated engineer may also contribute to the design of new products and systems.
