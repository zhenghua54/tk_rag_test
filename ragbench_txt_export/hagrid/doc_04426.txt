Swann has questioned whether 7 World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001, the way authorities said it did. See also 9/11 conspiracy theories. The National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) investigated the events of 7 World Trade Center. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers. Fires burned out of control during the afternoon, buckling critical columns, and ultimately causing the building to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for seven hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse. This made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper at the time to have collapsed from fire. The NIST report found no evidence supporting the conspiracy theories that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition.
