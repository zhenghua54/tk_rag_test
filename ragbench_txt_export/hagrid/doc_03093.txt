Dinklage's performance was praised; "The Boston Globe" called his Tyrion one of the show's "highlights", adding that Dinklage "gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware." Matt Roush of "TV Guide" told viewers to "rejoice in the scene-stealing bravado of Peter Dinklage as the wry 'imp' Tyrion Lannister." The "Los Angeles Times" wrote "In many ways, "Game of Thrones" belongs to Dinklage" even before, in Season 2, the "scene-stealing actor's" character became the series' most central figure. "The New York Times" noted that as beloved as the character of Tyrion is to the novels' fans, "Dinklage's sly performance has made Tyrion all the more popular." "The Huffington Post" called Tyrion the "most quotable" character on the HBO series, as well as one of the most beloved.
