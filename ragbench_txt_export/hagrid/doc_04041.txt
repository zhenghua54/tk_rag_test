The stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. It rests on the oval window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus. These are connected by anterior and posterior limbs (). The stapes articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint. The stapes is the smallest bone in the human body, and measures roughly 3 x 2.5mm, greater along the head-base span.
