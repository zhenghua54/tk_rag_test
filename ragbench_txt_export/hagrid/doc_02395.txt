For the scenes leading up to Colleen's death, "The Young and the Restless" went on location to Franklin Canyon, California. The inside of the lake that Colleen drowns in was recreated in the CBS Studios. "The Bold and the Beautiful's" head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell allowed Don Diamont to return to "The Young and the Restless" as Colleen's deceased father, Brad, as one of the visions Colleen has while unconscious. Diamont currently portrays "The Bold and the Beautiful's" Bill Spencer, Jr. "In order to accommodate contract constraints and actors' availability, we were writing scenes that were shot the following week, which is very unusual," said "The Young and the Restless's" co-headwriter Scott Hamner. "The appearance of Don gave a depth of feeling to the show that would not have been possible without him." During the taping of Colleen's final scenes, Sursok was not there. "They had to use insert shots of me [which were filmed beforehand] for when she was shown in bed at the hospital," she said.
