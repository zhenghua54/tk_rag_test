Ancient Egyptians had heard rumours of Lake Tana but had no idea how important the Blue Nile that flows over the "Smoking Fire Falls" with its fertile volcanic soil was to their civilisation.From the heart of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea runs the worldâ€™s longest river. Since the Egyptians first settled along its banks men have dreamt of discovering where the Nile was born, but for centuries the river kept its secrets close. The obsession grew and by the mid-19th century some were prepared to risk their lives to be the first to discover the source of the Nile.
