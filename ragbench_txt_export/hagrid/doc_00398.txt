Days of Our Lives (also stylized as Days of our Lives; often abbreviated to DOOL or Days) is an American daytime soap opera broadcast on the NBC television network. It is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday since November 8, 1965. It has since been syndicated to many countries around the world. Until the network's closure in 2013, Soapnet rebroadcast episodes of "Days" on a same-day basis each weeknight at 8:00 and 10:00 (Eastern and Pacific Time). The series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday. Irna Phillips was a story editor for "Days of Our Lives" and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell.
