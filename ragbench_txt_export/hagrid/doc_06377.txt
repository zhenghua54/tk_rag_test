Written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, the "Hunter × Hunter" manga began its ongoing serialization in "Weekly Shōnen Jump" magazine on March 3, 1998. Shueisha has compiled most of the chapters into 36 "tankōbon" volumes as of October 2018. In December 2011, Shueisha began republishing the manga into a magazine-styled "sōshūhen" format. The company published one volume per month for a total of six volumes, covering up to the end of the Greed Island story arc. In December 2012, Togashi wrote a two-part manga titled to act as a prequel to the first animated film. "Tokyo Ghoul" author Sui Ishida created a 69-page storyboard of a manga chapter depicting the past of "Hunter × Hunter"s Hisoka. The storyboard was released digitally via "Shonen Jump+" on June 2, 2016.
