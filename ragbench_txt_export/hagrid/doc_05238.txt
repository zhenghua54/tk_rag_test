Heyman was the lead writer for "SmackDown!" from July 2002 to February 2003. On Heyman's 2014 WWE documentary "Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman", Heyman stated that the "SmackDown!" brand he was writing was beating "Raw" in ratings, merchandise and live show attendance during a time McMahon wanted real-life competition between the Raw and SmackDown! brands.
