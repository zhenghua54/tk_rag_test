Gigantopithecus (from the Ancient Greek ' "giant", and ' "ape") is an extinct genus of ape that existed from perhaps nine million years to as recently as one hundred thousand years ago, at the same period as "Homo erectus" would have been dispersed, in what is now India, Vietnam, China and Indonesia placing "Gigantopithecus" in the same time frame and geographical location as several hominin species. The primate fossil record suggests that the species "Gigantopithecus blacki" were the largest known primates that ever lived, standing up to and weighing as much as , although some argue that it is more likely that they were much smaller, at roughly in height and in weight.
