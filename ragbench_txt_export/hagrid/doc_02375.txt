For the first Protector of Aborigines and the Aboriginal Protection Board, the problem of the large group of Aborigines camping around Brewarrina seemed to be one of the most pressing in the State. In 1882 a census listed 151 Aborigines and 24 half-castes at Brewarrina, many reported to be suffering from venereal diseases and "addicted to the habits of intemperance". In 1885 the Aboriginal Protection Board removed the Aboriginal population to a reserve 2 miles from town but urged the need for a home for Aboriginal people in the area. In 1886 the Aborigines Protection Association established a mission on a reserve of 5,000 acres, 10 miles east of the town on the opposite bank of the Barwon River.
