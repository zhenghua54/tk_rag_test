In 2007, Oricon polled readers on which characters they would most like to see in their own series. Fujiko appeared in the seventh position among female voters, and fifth place overall. The company also asked their readers in the very same year who they believed is the most beautiful woman in manga. Fujiko Mine was crowned the title by scoring first place overall with high rankings from both male and female voters. She was listed as the second most iconic anime heroine by Mania.com. In 2012, in a Japanese poll on which character's voice actor should never change, Fujiko came in second among males and third amongst females. In 2013, eBookJapan polled its female customers in their 20s and 30s on which manga heroine they felt had the ideal body. In the poll that considered their sexiness, physical fitness and health, Fujiko was the first place answer. A 2015 Charapedia poll, which asked fans to list their favourite "cool" women in anime, had Fujiko Mine placed seventeenth. In a 2017 survey that polled 12,000 Japanese, Fujiko Mine was voted the Most Splendid Heroine of the Sh≈çwa Era and the third most of the Heisei Era.
