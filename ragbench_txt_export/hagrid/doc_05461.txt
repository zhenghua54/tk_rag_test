RNA is a biological macromolecule made of sugars and nitrogenous bases that plays a number of crucial roles in all living cells. There are several subtypes of RNA, with the most prominent in the cell being tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA), and mRNA (messenger RNA). All three of these are involved in the process of translation, with the most prominent species (~85%) of cellular RNA being rRNA. As a result, this is the most immediately visible species when RNA is analyzed via electrophoresis and is thus used for determining RNA quality (see Computation, below). rRNA comes in various sizes, with those in mammals belonging to the sizes 5S, 18S, and 28S. The 28S and 5S rRNAs form the large subunit and the 18S forms the small subunit of the ribosome, the molecular machinery responsible for synthesizing proteins.
