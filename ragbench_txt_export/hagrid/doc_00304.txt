Four major Chinese-speech groups are represented in Indonesia: [[Hokkien]] (Southern Min; Min Nan), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]]. In addition to these, the [[Teochew people]] speak [[Teochew dialect|their own dialect]] that has some degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Hokkien]]. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million [[native speaker]]s of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of [[Southern Min]] varieties (including [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]); 640,000 [[Hakka]] speakers; 460,000 [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the [[Eastern Min]] varieties (including [[Fuzhou dialect]]). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the [[Indonesian language]].
