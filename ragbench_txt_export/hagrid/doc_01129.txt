In recent years, the soybean industry has grown exponentially in South America, primarily in Brazil and Argentina (South Americaâ€™s two largest countries) and Uruguay and Paraguay. For Paraguay especially, the results of this explosive growth have been substantial. While the soybean industry has brought economic expansion to Paraguay, the issue of social justice has been raised, as peasant farmers and campesinos cannot compete with big soybean farms. The issue may be referred to by some as the "Soybean Wars" of Paraguay.
