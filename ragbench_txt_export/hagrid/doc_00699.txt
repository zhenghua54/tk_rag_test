During the late-1930s and 1940s Golden Age of comic books, Moldoff became a prolific cover artist for the future DC Comics. His work includes the first cover of the Golden Age Green Lantern, on issue #16 (July 1940) of All-American's flagship title "All-American Comics", featuring the debut of that character created by artist Martin Nodell. Moldoff created the character Black Pirate (Jon Valor) in "Action Comics" #23 (April 1940), and became one of the earliest artists for the character Hawkman (created by Gardner Fox and Dennis Neville, though sometimes misattributed to Moldoff). Moldoff drew the first image of the formerly civilian character Shiera Sanders in costume as Hawkgirl in "All Star Comics" #5, based on Neville's Hawkman costume design.
