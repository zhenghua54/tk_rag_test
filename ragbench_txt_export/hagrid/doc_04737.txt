Despite concerns that British people are no longer eating traditional dishes, mince and tatties remains popular in Scotland. A survey by the "Scottish Daily Express" in 2009 found that it was the most popular Scottish dish, with a third of respondents saying that they eat mince and tatties once a week. This placed it above other dishes such as smoked salmon, haggis, Scotch pies and Scotch broth. An annual competition is held in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, to determine the best mince and tatties.
