The title of episode eleven "Under the Gravity's Rainbow" is a homage to the novel "Gravity's Rainbow" by Thomas Pynchon, which is known for ripping the normal rules of narrative and character development wide open and covering specialist knowledge from many fields, and is subsequently criticized for being "difficult" and "unreadable". The famous quote by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche "God is Dead" was used as the title of the CD given to Panuru, who didn't believe in the existence of God.
