The Colorado Rockies are a professional baseball team based in Denver, Colorado. The club has been owned since formation by Charles and Richard Monfort. The Rockies were created as an expansion team for the 1993 season and rose to a postseason appearance after three seasons and the 1994â€“95 strike. Since then they have played in the postseason four more times: in 2007 (when they lost the World Series to the Red Sox), 2009, 2017, and 2018. In 2012, the Rockies won only 64 games - the fewest in their history over a full season. They are one of the two MLB franchises that has never won a division title.
