In 2016, a Truthout investigation revealed commonplace fracking in the Gulf of Mexico, where offshore oil and gas drillers used fracking technology to maximize oil and gas production in aging undersea wells. A story broken by journalist Mike Ludwig revealed that the Obama administration had rubber-stamped 1,500 permit modifications to allow fracking in the Gulf of Mexico and had routinely excluded the practice from in-depth environmental reviewsâ€”even during the initial days of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. That investigation shined a critical light on industry's practice of mixing toxic fracking chemicals with drilling wastewater and dumping it directly into shallow waters of the Gulf. This practice was the subject of further legal challenges from environmental groups.
