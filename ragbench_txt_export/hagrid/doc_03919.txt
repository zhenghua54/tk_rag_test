In mathematics, a square root of a number "a" is a number "y" such that ; in other words, a number "y" whose "square" (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or ) is "a". For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16 because .
Every nonnegative real number "a" has a unique nonnegative square root, called the "principal square root", which is denoted by , where √ is called the "radical sign" or "radix". For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by = 3, because and 3 is nonnegative. The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the "radicand". The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this example 9.
