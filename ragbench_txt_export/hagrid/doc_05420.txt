Zac can't handle his guilt and admits to Leah that he cheated. She then isolates herself from him and tells him not to tell VJ while she is away at her parents' house. Zac tries to make amends by phoning Leah but she hangs up every time. He tries emailing her, and she replies that she wants him to leave her alone as he cheated. Zac goes out shopping for dinner that night and VJ sees Leah's reply whilst he is out, knowing now that Zac cheated on his mother. VJ, like Leah, isolates himself from Zac and demands he moves out to the Caravan Park. Leah returns from her trip and Zac tries to make amends and he and Leah end up kissing. However, Leah breaks off after she sees the way he looks at her and demands he moves out of the house permanently. Zac rents a caravan and ends up having a chat with John Palmer (Shane Withington), whose court trial is just days away. John gives some advice on how to make amends with Leah. After VJ sees that Zac is at the Caravan Park and not with his mother, he is convinced Zac no longer cares about Leah and takes a punch at Zac, but John restrains VJ before he can do any serious damage.
